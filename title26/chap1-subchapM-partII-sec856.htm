<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A real estate investment trust which meets the requirements of this paragraph at the close of any quarter shall not lose its status as a real estate investment trust because of a discrepancy during a subsequent quarter between the value of its various investments and such requirements unless such discrepancy exists immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property and is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition. A real estate investment trust which does not meet such requirements at the close of any quarter by reason of a discrepancy existing immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property which is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition during such quarter shall not lose its status for such quarter as a real estate investment trust if such discrepancy is <!-- PDFPage:1559 -->eliminated within 30 days after the close of such quarter and in such cases it shall be considered to have met such requirements at the close of such quarter for purposes of applying the preceding sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) For purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The term &ldquo;value&rdquo; means, with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such securities; and with respect to other securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith by the trustees, except that in the case of securities of real estate investment trusts such fair value shall not exceed market value or asset value, whichever is higher.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The term &ldquo;real estate assets&rdquo; means real property (including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property) and shares (or transferable certificates of beneficial interest) in other real estate investment trusts which meet the requirements of this part. Such term also includes any property (not otherwise a real estate asset) attributable to the temporary investment of new capital, but only if such property is stock or a debt instrument, and only for the 1-year period beginning on the date the real estate trust receives such capital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The term &ldquo;interests in real property&rdquo; includes fee ownership and co-ownership of land or improvements thereon, leaseholds of land or improvements thereon, options to acquire land or improvements thereon, and options to acquire leaseholds of land or improvements thereon, but does not include mineral, oil, or gas royalty interests.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;qualified temporary investment income&rdquo; means any income which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is attributable to stock or a debt instrument (within the meaning of section 1275(a)(1)),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) is attributable to the temporary investment of new capital, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) is received or accrued during the 1-year period beginning on the date on which the real estate investment trust receives such capital.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) in a public offering of debt obligations of such trust which have maturities of at least 5 years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) A regular or residual interest in a REMIC shall be treated as a real estate asset, and any amount includible in gross income with respect to such an interest shall be treated as interest on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property; except that, if less than 95 percent of the assets of such REMIC are real estate assets (determined as if the real estate investment trust held such assets), such real estate investment trust shall be treated as holding directly (and as receiving directly) its proportionate share of the assets and income of the REMIC. For purposes of determining whether any interest in a REMIC qualifies under the preceding sentence, any interest held by such REMIC in another REMIC shall be treated as a real estate asset under principles similar to the principles of the preceding sentence, except that, if such REMIC's are part of a tiered structure, they shall be treated as one REMIC for purposes of this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) All other terms shall have the same meaning as when used in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;1 and following).</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A corporation, trust, or association which fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3), or of both such paragraphs, for any taxable year shall nevertheless be considered to have satisfied the requirements of such paragraphs for such taxable year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) following the corporation, trust, or association's identification of the failure to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3), or of both such paragraphs, for any taxable year, a description of each item of its gross income described in such paragraphs is set forth in a schedule for such taxable year filed in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the failure to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3), or of both such paragraphs, is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (C), with respect to each lease of real property, rent attributable to personal property for the taxable year is that amount which bears the same ratio to total rent for the taxable year as the average of the fair market values of the personal property at the beginning and at the end of the taxable year bears to the average of the aggregate fair market values of both the real property and the personal property at the beginning and at the end of such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amounts excluded</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule for certain contingent rents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where a real estate investment trust receives or accrues, with respect to real or personal property, any amount which would be excluded from the term &ldquo;rents from real property&rdquo; solely because the tenant of the real estate investment trust receives or accrues, directly or indirectly, from subtenants any amount the determination of which depends in whole or in part on the income or profits derived by any person from such property, only a proportionate part (determined pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary) of the amount received or accrued by the real estate investment trust from that tenant will be excluded from the term &ldquo;rents from real property&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a portion of the amount such tenant receives or accrues, directly or indirectly, from subtenants consists of qualified rents,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then the amounts which the trust receives or accrues from the tenant shall not be excluded from the term &ldquo;rents from real property&rdquo; by reason of being based on the income or profits of such tenant to the extent the amounts so received or accrued are attributable to qualified rents received or accrued by such tenant.</p>
