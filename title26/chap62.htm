<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a corporation, in any taxable year, files with the Secretary a statement, as provided in subsection (b), with respect to an expected net operating loss carryback from such taxable year, the time for payment of all or part of any tax imposed by subtitle A for the taxable year immediately preceding such taxable year shall be extended, to the extent and subject to the conditions and limitations hereinafter provided in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Contents of statement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The statement shall be filed at such time and in such manner and form as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe. Such statement shall set forth that the corporation expects to have a net operating loss carryback, as provided in section 172(b), from the taxable year in which such statement is made, and shall set forth, in such detail and with such supporting data and explanation as such regulations shall require&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the estimated amount of the expected net operating loss;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the reasons, facts, and circumstances which cause the corporation to expect such net operating loss;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the amount of the reduction of the tax previously determined attributable to the expected carryback, such tax previously determined being ascertained in accordance with the method prescribed in section 1314(a); and such reduction being determined by applying the expected carryback in the manner provided by law to the items on the basis of which such tax was determined;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the tax and the part thereof the time for payment of which is to be extended; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) such other information for purposes of carrying out the provisions of this section as may be required by such regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall, upon request, furnish a receipt for any statement filed, which shall set forth the date of such filing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount to which extension relates and installment payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount the time for payment of which may be extended under subsection (a) with respect to any tax shall not exceed the amount of such tax shown on the return, increased by any amount assessed as a deficiency (or as interest or addition to the tax) prior to the date of filing the statement and decreased by any amount paid or required to be paid prior to the date of such filing, and the total amount of the tax the time for payment of which may be extended shall not exceed the amount stated under subsection (b)(3). For purposes of this subsection, an amount shall not be considered as required to be paid unless shown on the return or assessed as a deficiency (or as interest or addition to the tax), and an amount assessed as a deficiency (or as interest or addition to the tax) shall be considered to be required to be paid prior to the date of filing of the statement if the 10th day after notice and demand for its payment occurs prior to such date. If an extension of time under <!-- PDFPage:2911 -->this section relates to only a part of the tax, the time for payment of the remainder shall be the date on which payment would have been required if such remainder had been the tax.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Period of extension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The extension of time for payment provided in this section shall expire&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on the last day of the month in which falls the last date prescribed by law (including any extension of time granted the taxpayer) for the filing of the return for the taxable year of the expected net operating loss, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if an application for tentative carryback adjustment provided in section 6411 with respect to such loss is filed before the expiration of the period prescribed in paragraph (1), on the date on which notice is mailed by certified mail or registered mail by the Secretary to the taxpayer that such application is allowed or disallowed in whole or in part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Revised statements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each statement filed under subsection (a) with respect to any taxable year shall be in lieu of the last statement previously filed with respect to such year. If the amount the time for payment of which is extended under a statement filed is less than the amount under the last statement previously filed, the extension of time shall be terminated as to the difference between the two amounts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is not required to make any examination of the statement, but he may make such examination thereof as he deems necessary and practicable. The Secretary shall terminate the extension as to any part of the amount to which it relates which he deems should be terminated because, upon such examination, he believes that, as of the time such examination is made, all or any part of the statement clearly is in a material respect erroneous or unreasonable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Payments on termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an extension of time is terminated under subsection (e) or (f) with respect to any amount, then&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no further extension of time shall be made under this section with respect to such amount, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the time for payment of such amount shall be considered to be the date on which payment would have been required if there had been no extension with respect to such amount.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Jeopardy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary believes that collection of the amount to which an extension under this section relates is in jeopardy, he shall immediately terminate such extension, and notice and demand shall be made by him for payment of such amount.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Consolidated returns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the corporation seeking an extension of time under this section made or was required to make a consolidated return, either for the taxable year within which the net operating loss arises or for the preceding taxable year affected by such loss, the provisions of such section shall apply only to such extent and subject to such conditions, limitations, and exceptions as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Extension allowed by election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a corporation has a recovery of a foreign expropriation loss to which section 1351 applies, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the portion of the recovery received in money is less than 25 percent of the amount of such recovery (as defined in section 1351(c)) and is not greater than the tax attributable to such recovery,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the tax attributable to such recovery shall, at the election of the taxpayer, be payable in 10 equal installments on the 15th day of the third month of each of the taxable years following the taxable year of the recovery. Such election shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations. If an election is made under this subsection, the provisions of this subtitle shall apply as though the Secretary were extending the time for payment of such tax.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Extension permitted by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a corporation has a recovery of a foreign expropriation loss to which section 1351 applies and if an election is not made under subsection (a), the Secretary may, upon finding that the payment of the tax attributable to such recovery at the time otherwise provided in this subtitle would result in undue hardship, extend the time for payment of such tax for a reasonable period or periods not in excess of 9 years from the date on which such tax is otherwise payable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Acceleration of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an election is made under subsection (a),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) during any taxable year before the tax attributable to such recovery is paid in full&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any property (other than money) received on such recovery is sold or exchanged, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any property (other than money) received on any sale or exchange described in subparagraph (A) is sold or exchanged, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the amount of money received on such sale or exchange (reduced by the amount of the tax imposed under chapter 1 with respect to such sale or exchange), when added to the amount of money&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) received on such recovery, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) received on previous sales or exchanges described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2) (as so reduced),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">exceeds the amount of money which may be received under subsection (a)(2),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">an amount of the tax attributable to such recovery equal to such excess shall be payable on the <!-- PDFPage:2919 -->15th day of the third month of the taxable year following the taxable year in which such sale or exchange occurs. The amount of such tax so paid shall be treated, for purposes of this section, as a payment of the first unpaid installment or installments (or portion thereof) which become payable under subsection (a) following such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Proration of deficiency to installments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an election is made under subsection (a), and a deficiency attributable to the recovery of a foreign expropriation loss has been assessed, the deficiency shall be prorated to such installments. The part of the deficiency so prorated to any installment the date for payment of which has not arrived shall be collected at the same time as, and as part of, such installment. The part of the deficiency so prorated to any installment the date for payment of which has arrived shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary. This subsection shall not apply if the deficiency is due to negligence, to intentional disregard of rules and regulations, or to fraud with intent to evade tax.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Time for payment of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the time for payment for any amount of tax has been extended under this section, interest payable under section 6601 on any unpaid portion of such amount shall be paid annually at the same time as, and as part of, each installment payment of the tax. Interest, on that part of a deficiency prorated under this section to any installment the date for payment of which has not arrived, for the period before the date fixed for the last installment preceding the assessment of the deficiency, shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Tax attributable to recovery of foreign expropriation loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the tax attributable to a recovery of a foreign expropriation loss is the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the additional tax imposed by section 1351(d)(1) on such recovery, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount by which the tax imposed under subtitle A is increased by reason of the gain on such recovery which under section 1351(e) is considered as gain on the involuntary conversion of property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Failure to pay installment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any installment under this section is not paid on or before the date fixed for its payment by this section (including any extension of time for the payment of such installment), the unpaid portion of the tax payable in installments shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Cross-references</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>(1) Security.&mdash;For authority of the Secretary to require security in the case of an extension under this section, see section 6165.</strong></p>
