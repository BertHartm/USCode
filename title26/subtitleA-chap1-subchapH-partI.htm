<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Taxation of common trust funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A common trust fund shall not be subject to taxation under this chapter and for purposes of this chapter shall not be considered a corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Income of participants in fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each participant in the common trust fund in computing its taxable income shall include, whether or not distributed and whether or not distributable&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Different taxable years of common trust fund and participant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the taxable year of the common trust fund is different from that of a participant, the inclusions with respect to the taxable income of the common trust fund, in computing the taxable income of the participant for its taxable year, shall be based upon the taxable income of the common trust fund for any taxable year of the common trust fund ending within or with the taxable year of the participant.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Participants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The basis of the stock which is received in an exchange referred to in paragraph (1)(B) shall be the same as that of the property exchanged.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of assumptions of liability</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) any adjustment to the basis of a participant's interest in the common trust fund as a result of the gain so recognized shall be treated as occurring immediately before the exchange referred to in paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;If the transfer referred to in paragraph (1)(A) is to two or more regulated investment companies, the basis increase under subclause (II) shall be allocated among such companies on the basis of the respective fair market values of the assets received by each of such companies.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Assumed liabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), the term &ldquo;assumed liabilities&rdquo; means any liability of the common trust fund assumed by any regulated investment company in connection with the transfer referred to in paragraph (1)(A).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Taxable year of common trust fund</h4>
