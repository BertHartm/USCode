<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7422. Civil actions for refund</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) No suit prior to filing claim for refund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Secretary, according to the provisions of law in that regard, and the regulations of the Secretary established in pursuance thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Protest or duress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such suit or proceeding may be maintained whether or not such tax, penalty, or sum has been paid under protest or duress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Suits against collection officer a bar</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A suit against any officer or employee of the United States (or former officer or employee) or his personal representative for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected shall be treated as if the United States had been a party to such suit in applying the doctrine of res judicata in all suits in respect of any internal revenue tax, and in all proceedings in the Tax Court and on review of decisions of the Tax Court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Credit treated as payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The credit of an overpayment of any tax in satisfaction of any tax liability shall, for the purpose of any suit for refund of such tax liability so satisfied, be deemed to be a payment in respect of such tax liability at the time such credit is allowed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Stay of proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary prior to the hearing of a suit brought by a taxpayer in a district court or the United States Court of Federal Claims for the recovery of any income tax, estate tax, gift tax, or tax imposed by chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 (or any penalty relating to such taxes) mails to the taxpayer a notice that a deficiency has been determined in respect of the tax which is the subject matter of taxpayer's suit, the proceedings in taxpayer's suit shall be stayed during the period of time in which the taxpayer may file a petition with the Tax Court for a redetermination of the asserted deficiency, and for 60 days thereafter. If the taxpayer files a petition with the Tax Court, the district court or the United States Court of Federal Claims, as the case may be, shall lose jurisdiction of taxpayer's suit to whatever extent jurisdiction is acquired by the Tax Court of the subject matter of taxpayer's suit for refund. If the taxpayer does not file a petition with the Tax Court for a redetermination of the asserted deficiency, the United States may counterclaim in the taxpayer's suit, or intervene in the event of a suit as described in subsection (c) (relating to suits against officers or employees of the United States), within the period of the stay of proceedings notwithstanding that the time for such pleading may have otherwise expired. The taxpayer shall have the burden of proof with respect to the issues raised by such counterclaim or intervention of the United States except as to the issue of whether the taxpayer has been guilty of fraud with intent to evade tax. This subsection shall not apply to a suit by a taxpayer which, prior to the date of enactment of this title, is commenced, instituted, or pending in a district court or the United States Court of Federal Claims for the recovery of any income tax, estate tax, or gift tax (or any penalty relating to such taxes).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation on right of action for refund</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A suit or proceeding referred to in subsection (a) may be maintained only against the United States and not against any officer or employee of the United States (or former officer or employee) or his personal representative. Such suit or proceeding may be maintained against the United States notwithstanding the provisions of section 2502 of title 28 of the United States Code (relating to aliens&rsquo; privilege to sue) and notwithstanding the provisions of section 1502 of such title 28 (relating to certain treaty cases).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Misjoinder and change of venue</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a suit or proceeding brought in a United States district court against an officer or employee of the United States (or former officer or employee) or his personal representative is improperly brought solely by virtue of paragraph (1), the court shall order, upon such terms as are just, that the pleadings be amended to substitute the United States as a party for such officer or employee as of the time such action commenced, upon proper service of process on the United States. Such suit or proceeding shall upon request by the <!-- PDFPage:2677 -->United States be transferred to the district or division where it should have been brought if such action initially had been brought against the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Special rules for certain excise taxes imposed by chapter 42 or 43</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Right to bring actions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to any taxable event, payment of the full amount of the first tier tax shall constitute sufficient payment in order to maintain an action under this section with respect to the second tier tax.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the terms &ldquo;taxable event&rdquo;, &ldquo;first tier tax&rdquo;, and &ldquo;second tier tax&rdquo; have the respective meanings given to such terms by section 4963.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation on suit for refund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No suit may be maintained under this section for the credit or refund of any tax imposed under section 4941, 4942, 4943, 4944, 4945, 4951, 4952, 4955, 4971, or 4975 with respect to any act (or failure to act) giving rise to liability for tax under such sections, unless no other suit has been maintained for credit or refund of, and no petition has been filed in the Tax Court with respect to a deficiency in, any other tax imposed by such sections with respect to such act (or failure to act).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Final determination of issues</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, any suit for the credit or refund of any tax imposed under section 4941, 4942, 4943, 4944, 4945, 4951, 4952, 4955, 4971, or 4975 with respect to any act (or failure to act) giving rise to liability for tax under such sections, shall constitute a suit to determine all questions with respect to any other tax imposed with respect to such act (or failure to act) under such sections, and failure by the parties to such suit to bring any such question before the Court shall constitute a bar to such question.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Special rule for actions with respect to partnership items</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No action may be brought for a refund attributable to partnership items (as defined in section 6231(a)(3)) except as provided in section 6228(b) or section 6230(c).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Special rule for actions with respect to tax shelter promoter and understatement penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No action or proceeding may be brought in the United States Court of Federal Claims for any refund or credit of a penalty imposed by section 6700 (relating to penalty for promoting abusive tax shelters, etc.) or section 6701 (relating to penalties for aiding and abetting understatement of tax liability).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a levy has been made on property or property has been sold pursuant to a levy, and any person (other than the person against whom is assessed the tax out of which such levy arose) who claims an interest in or lien on such property and that such property was wrongfully levied upon may bring a civil action against the United States in a district court of the United States. Such action may be brought without regard to whether such property has been surrendered to or sold by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Surplus proceed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If property has been sold pursuant to a levy, any person (other than the person against whom is assessed the tax out of which such levy arose) who claims an interest in or lien on such property junior to that of the United States and to be legally entitled to the surplus proceeds of such sale may bring a civil action against the United States in a district court of the United States.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Recovery of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the court determines that such property has been wrongfully levied upon, the court may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) order the return of specific property if the United States is in possession of such property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) grant a judgment for the amount of money levied upon; or</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Substituted sale proceeds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the court determines that a party has an interest in or lien on the amount held as a fund pursuant to an agreement described in section 6325(b)(3) (relating to substitution of proceeds of sale), the court may grant a judgment in an amount equal to all or any part of the amount of such fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Validity of assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of an adjudication under this section, the assessment of tax upon which the interest or lien of the United States is based shall be conclusively presumed to be valid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on rights of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No action may be maintained against any officer or employee of the United States (or former officer or employee) or his personal representative with respect to any acts for which an action could be maintained under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Substitution of United States as party</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an action, which could be brought against the United States under this section, is improperly brought against any officer or employee of the United States (or former officer or employee) or his personal representative, the court shall order, upon such terms as are just, that the pleadings be amended to substitute the United States as a party for such officer or employee as of the time such action was commenced upon proper service of process on the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) with respect to the initial qualification or continuing qualification of an organization as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a) or as an organization described in section 170(c)(2),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) with respect to the initial classification or continuing classification of an organization as a private operating foundation (as defined in section 4942(j)(3)), or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a failure by the Secretary to make a determination with respect to an issue referred to in paragraph (1),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, the United States Tax Court, the United States Court of Federal Claims, or the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia may make a declaration with respect to such initial qualification or continuing qualification or with respect to such initial classification or continuing classification. Any such declaration shall have the force and effect of a decision of the Tax Court or a final judgment or decree of the district court or the Court of Federal Claims, as the case may be, and shall be reviewable as such. For purposes of this section, a determination with respect to a continuing qualification or continuing classification includes any revocation of or other change in a qualification or classification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Petitioner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A pleading may be filed under this section only by the organization the qualification or classification of which is at issue.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exhaustion of administrative remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A declaratory judgment or decree under this section shall not be issued in any proceeding <!-- PDFPage:2683 -->unless the Tax Court, the Court of Federal Claims, or the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia determines that the organization involved has exhausted administrative remedies available to it within the Internal Revenue Service. An organization requesting the determination of an issue referred to in subsection (a)(1) shall be deemed to have exhausted its administrative remedies with respect to a failure by the Secretary to make a determination with respect to such issue at the expiration of 270 days after the date on which the request for such determination was made if the organization has taken, in a timely manner, all reasonable steps to secure such determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Time for bringing action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary sends by certified or registered mail notice of his determination with respect to an issue referred to in subsection (a)(1) to the organization referred to in paragraph (1), no proceeding may be initiated under this section by such organization unless the pleading is filed before the 91st day after the date of such mailing.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a decision of the Tax Court has become final (within the meaning of section 7481), or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a judgment of the Court of Federal Claims, has been entered,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">and such decision or judgment, as the case may be, determines that the organization was not described in section 170(c)(2),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then, notwithstanding such decision or judgment, such organization shall be treated as having been described in section 170(c)(2) for purposes of section 170 for the period beginning on the date on which the notice of the revocation was published and ending on the date on which the court first determined in such proceeding that the organization was not described in section 170(c)(2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall apply only&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) with respect to individuals, and only to the extent that the aggregate of the contributions made by any individual to or for the use of the organization during the period specified in paragraph (1) does not exceed $1,000 (for this purpose treating a husband and wife as one contributor), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with respect to organizations described in section 170(c)(2) which are exempt from tax under section 501(a) (for this purpose excluding any such organization with respect to which there is pending a proceeding to revoke the determination under section 170(c)(2)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to any individual who was responsible, in whole or in part, for the activities (or failures to act) on the part of the organization which were the basis for the revocation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Extension of 20-day period where taxpayer so requests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the taxpayer requests an extension of the 20-day period set forth in subsection (b)(2) and establishes reasonable grounds why such extension should be granted, the court may grant an extension of not more than 40 additional days.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a civil action is filed under subsection (b) with the Tax Court and such court finds that there is want of jurisdiction because of the jurisdiction provisions of subsection (b)(2), then the Tax Court shall, if such court determines it is in the interest of justice, transfer the civil action to the district court in which the action could have been brought at the time such action was filed. Any civil action so transferred shall proceed as if such action had been filed in the district court to which such action is transferred on the date on which such action was actually filed in the Tax Court from which such action is transferred.</p>
