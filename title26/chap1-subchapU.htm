<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a rural area, 30,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Distress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The nominated area is one of pervasive poverty, unemployment, and general distress.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Size</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The nominated area&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has a boundary which is continuous, or, except in the case of a rural area located in more than 1 State, consists of not more than 3 noncontiguous parcels,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The 20 percent threshold in subsection (a)(4)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The 25 percent threshold in subsection (a)(4)(B).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If the appropriate Secretary elects to reduce the threshold under subparagraph (C), such Secretary may (in lieu of applying the preceding sentence) reduce by 10 percentage points the threshold under subparagraph (C) for 3 population census tracts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Each noncontiguous area must satisfy poverty rate rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A nominated area may not include a noncontiguous parcel unless such parcel separately meets (subject to paragraphs (1) and (2)) the criteria set forth in subsection (a)(4).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Areas not within census tracts</h4>
