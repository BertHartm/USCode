<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Each noncontiguous area must satisfy poverty rate rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A nominated area may not include a noncontiguous parcel unless such parcel separately meets (subject to paragraphs (1) and (2)) the criteria set forth in subsection (a)(4).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Areas not within census tracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an area which is not tracted for population census tracts, the equivalent county divisions (as defined by the Bureau of the Census for purposes of defining poverty areas) shall be used for purposes of determining poverty rates.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Factors to consider</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">From among the nominated areas eligible for designation under section 1391 by the appropriate Secretary, such appropriate Secretary shall make designations of empowerment zones and enterprise communities on the basis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the effectiveness of the strategic plan submitted pursuant to section 1391(f)(2) and the assurances made pursuant to section 1391(e)(3), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) criteria specified by the appropriate Secretary.</p>
