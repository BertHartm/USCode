<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In determining whether a plan meets the requirements of subparagraph (A), any benefits provided under any other plan shall not be taken into consideration, except that a plan shall not be considered discriminatory&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rules applicable to organizations described in paragraph (7), (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c)</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an organization described in paragraph (7), (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c), the term &ldquo;unrelated business taxable income&rdquo; means the gross income (excluding any exempt function income), less the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the production of the gross income (excluding exempt function income), both computed with the modifications provided in paragraphs (6), (10), (11), and (12) of subsection (b). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the deductions provided by sections 243, 244, and 245 (relating to dividends received by corporations) shall be treated as not directly connected with the production of gross income.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exempt function income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;exempt function income&rdquo; means the gross income from dues, fees, charges, or similar amounts paid by members of the organization as consideration for providing such members or their dependents or guests goods, facilities, or services in furtherance of the purposes constituting the basis for the exemption of the organization to which such income is paid. Such term also means all income (other than an amount equal to the gross income derived from any unrelated trade or business regularly carried on by such organization computed as if the organization were subject to paragraph (1)), which is set aside&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Applicability to certain corporations described in section 501(c)(2)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a corporation described in section 501(c)(2), the income of which is payable to an organization described in paragraph (7), (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c), subparagraph (A) shall apply as if such corporation were the organization to which the income is payable. For purposes of the preceding sentence, such corporation shall be treated as having exempt function income for a taxable year only if it files a consolidated return with such organization for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Nonrecognition of gain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If property used directly in the performance of the exempt function of an organization described in paragraph (7), (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c) is sold by such organization, and within a period beginning 1 year before the date of such sale, and ending 3 years after such date, other property is purchased and used by such organization di<!-- PDFPage:1490 -->rectly in the performance of its exempt function, gain (if any) from such sale shall be recognized only to the extent that such organization's sales price of the old property exceeds the organization's cost of purchasing the other property. For purposes of this subparagraph, the destruction in whole or in part, theft, seizure, requisition, or condemnation of property, shall be treated as the sale of such property, and rules similar to the rules provided by subsections (b), (c), (e), and (j) of section 1034 (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997) shall apply.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of any organization described in paragraph (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c), a set-aside for any purpose specified in clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) may be taken into account under subparagraph (B) only to the extent that such set-aside does not result in an amount of assets set aside for such purpose in excess of the account limit determined under section 419A (without regard to subsection (f)(6) thereof) for the taxable year (not taking into account any reserve described in section 419A(c)(2)(A) for post-retirement medical benefits).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Treatment of existing reserves for post-retirement medical or life insurance benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) Clause (i) shall not apply to any income attributable to an existing reserve for post-retirement medical or life insurance benefits.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) All payments during plan years ending on or after the date of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 of post-retirement medical benefits or life insurance benefits shall be charged against the reserve referred to in subclause (II).

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Treatment of tax exempt organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">This subparagraph shall not apply to any organization if substantially all of the contributions to such organization are made by employers who were exempt from tax under this chapter throughout the 5-taxable year period ending with the taxable year in which the contributions are made.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Unrelated debt-financed income and deductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In computing under section 512 the unrelated business taxable income for any taxable year&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Percentage of income taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There shall be included with respect to each debt-financed property as an item of gross income derived from an unrelated trade or business an amount which is the same percentage (but not in excess of 100 percent) of the total gross income derived during the taxable year from or on account of such property as (A) the average acquisition indebtedness (as defined in subsection (c)(7)) for the taxable year with respect to the property is of (B) the average amount (determined under regulations pre<!-- PDFPage:1505 -->scribed by the Secretary) of the adjusted basis of such property during the period it is held by the organization during such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Percentage of deductions taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There shall be allowed as a deduction with respect to each debt-financed property an amount determined by applying (except as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph) the percentage derived under paragraph (1) to the sum determined under paragraph (3). The percentage derived under this paragraph shall not be applied with respect to the deduction of any capital loss resulting from the carryback or carryover of net capital losses under section 1212.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Deductions allowable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The sum referred to in paragraph (2) is the sum of the deductions under this chapter which are directly connected with the debt-financed property or the income therefrom, except that if the debt-financed property is of a character which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167, the allowance shall be computed only by use of the straight-line method.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definition of debt-financed property</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;debt-financed property&rdquo; means any property which is held to produce income and with respect to which there is an acquisition indebtedness (as defined in subsection (c)) at any time during the taxable year (or, if the property was disposed of during the taxable year, with respect to which there was an acquisition indebtedness at any time during the 12-month period ending with the date of such disposition), except that such term does not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) any property substantially all the use of which is substantially related (aside from the need of the organization for income or funds) to the exercise or performance by such organization of its charitable, educational, or other purpose or function constituting the basis for its exemption under section 501 (or, in the case of an organization described in section 511(a)(2)(B), to the exercise or performance of any purpose or function designated in section 501(c)(3)), or (ii) any property to which clause (i) does not apply, to the extent that its use is so substantially related;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) except in the case of income excluded under section 512(b)(5), any property to the extent that the income from such property is taken into account in computing the gross income of any unrelated trade or business;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any property to the extent that the income from such property is excluded by reason of the provisions of paragraph (7), (8), or (9) of section 512(b) in computing the gross income of any unrelated trade or business;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any property to the extent that it is used in any trade or business described in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of section 513(a); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) any property the gain or loss from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of which would be excluded by reason of the provisions of section 512(b)(19) in computing the gross income of any unrelated trade or business.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), substantially all the use of a property shall be considered to be substantially related to the exercise or performance by an organization of its charitable, educational, or other purpose or function constituting the basis for its exemption under section 501 if such property is real property subject to a lease to a medical clinic entered into primarily for purposes which are substantially related (aside from the need of such organization for income or funds or the use it makes of the rents derived) to the exercise or performance by such organization of its charitable, educational, or other purpose or function constituting the basis for its exemption under section 501.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule for related uses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of applying paragraphs (1) (A), (C), and (D), the use of any property by an exempt organization which is related to an organization shall be treated as use by such organization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rules when land is acquired for exempt use within 10 years</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Neighborhood land</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an organization acquires real property for the principal purpose of using the land (commencing within 10 years of the time of acquisition) in the manner described in paragraph (1)(A) and at the time of acquisition the property is in the neighborhood of other property owned by the organization which is used in such manner, the real property acquired for such future use shall not be treated as debt-financed property so long as the organization does not abandon its intent to so use the land within the 10-year period. The preceding sentence shall not apply for any period after the expiration of the 10-year period, and shall apply after the first 5 years of the 10-year period only if the organization establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it is reasonably certain that the land will be used in the described manner before the expiration of the 10-year period.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Other cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the first sentence of subparagraph (A) is inapplicable only because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the acquired land is not in the neighborhood referred to in subparagraph (A), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the organization (for the period after the first 5 years of the 10-year period) is unable to establish to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it is reasonably certain that the land will be used in the manner described in paragraph (1)(A) before the expiration of the 10-year period,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">but the land is converted to such use by the organization within the 10-year period, the real property (subject to the provisions of subparagraph (D)) shall not be treated as debt-financed property for any period before such conversion. For purposes of this subparagraph, land shall not be treated as used in the manner described in paragraph (1)(A) <!-- PDFPage:1506 -->by reason of the use made of any structure which was on the land when acquired by the organization.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraphs (A) and (B)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall apply with respect to any structure on the land when acquired by the organization, or to the land occupied by the structure, only if (and so long as) the intended future use of the land in the manner described in paragraph (1)(A) requires that the structure be demolished or removed in order to use the land in such manner;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall not apply to structures erected on the land after the acquisition of the land; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) shall not apply to property subject to a lease which is a business lease (as defined in this section immediately before the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1976).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Refund of taxes when subparagraph (B) applies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an organization for any taxable year has not used land in the manner to satisfy the actual use condition of subparagraph (B) before the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for such taxable year, the tax for such year shall be computed without regard to the application of subparagraph (B), but if and when such use condition is satisfied, the provisions of subparagraph (B) shall then be applied to such taxable year. If the actual use condition of subparagraph (B) is satisfied for any taxable year after such time for filing the return, and if credit or refund of any overpayment for the taxable year resulting from the satisfaction of such use condition is prevented at the close of the taxable year in which the use condition is satisfied, by the operation of any law or rule of law (other than chapter 74, relating to closing agreements and compromises), credit or refund of such overpayment may nevertheless be allowed or made if claim therefor is filed before the expiration of 1 year after the close of the taxable year in which the use condition is satisfied.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Special rule for churches</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In applying this paragraph to a church or convention or association of churches, in lieu of the 10-year period referred to in subparagraphs (A) and (B) a 15-year period shall be applied, and subparagraphs (A) and (B)(ii) shall apply whether or not the acquired land meets the neighborhood test.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Acquisition indebtedness</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;acquisition indebtedness&rdquo; means, with respect to any debt-financed property, the unpaid amount of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the indebtedness incurred by the organization in acquiring or improving such property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the indebtedness incurred before the acquisition or improvement of such property if such indebtedness would not have been incurred but for such acquisition or improvement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the indebtedness incurred after the acquisition or improvement of such property if such indebtedness would not have been incurred but for such acquisition or improvement and the incurrence of such indebtedness was reasonably foreseeable at the time of such acquisition or improvement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Property acquired subject to mortgage, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Where property (no matter how acquired) is acquired subject to a mortgage or other similar lien, the amount of the indebtedness secured by such mortgage or lien shall be considered as an indebtedness of the organization incurred in acquiring such property even though the organization did not assume or agree to pay such indebtedness.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Where property subject to a mortgage is acquired by an organization by bequest or devise, the indebtedness secured by the mortgage shall not be treated as acquisition indebtedness during a period of 10 years following the date of the acquisition. If an organization acquires property by gift subject to a mortgage which was placed on the property more than 5 years before the gift, which property was held by the donor more than 5 years before the gift, the indebtedness secured by such mortgage shall not be treated as acquisition indebtedness during a period of 10 years following the date of such gift. This subparagraph shall not apply if the organization, in order to acquire the equity in the property by bequest, devise, or gift, assumes and agrees to pay the indebtedness secured by the mortgage, or if the organization makes any payment for the equity in the property owned by the decedent or the donor.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Liens for taxes or assessments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Where State law provides that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a lien for taxes, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a lien for assessments,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">made by a State or a political subdivision thereof attaches to property prior to the time when such taxes or assessments become due and payable, then such lien shall be treated as similar to a mortgage (within the meaning of subparagraph (A)) but only after such taxes or assessments become due and payable and the organization has had an opportunity to pay such taxes or assessments in accordance with State law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Extension of obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, an extension, renewal, or refinancing of an obligation evidencing a pre-existing indebtedness shall not be treated as the creation of a new indebtedness.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Indebtedness incurred in performing exempt purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;acquisition indebtedness&rdquo; does not include in<!-- PDFPage:1507 -->debtedness the incurrence of which is inherent in the performance or exercise of the purpose or function constituting the basis of the organization's exemption, such as the indebtedness incurred by a credit union described in section 501(c)(14) in accepting deposits from its members.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Annuities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;acquisition indebtedness&rdquo; does not include an obligation to pay an annuity which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is the sole consideration (other than a mortgage to which paragraph (2)(B) applies) issued in exchange for property if, at the time of the exchange, the value of the annuity is less than 90 percent of the value of the property received in the exchange,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is payable over the life of one individual in being at the time the annuity is issued, or over the lives of two individuals in being at such time, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) is payable under a contract which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) does not guarantee a minimum amount of payments or specify a maximum amount of payments, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) does not provide for any adjustment of the amount of the annuity payments by reference to the income received from the transferred property or any other property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Certain Federal financing</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;acquisition indebtedness&rdquo; does not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an obligation, to the extent that it is insured by the Federal Housing Administration, to finance the purchase, rehabilitation, or construction of housing for low and moderate income persons, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) indebtedness incurred by a small business investment company licensed after the date of the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 if such indebtedness is evidenced by a debenture&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) issued by such company under section 303(a) of such Act, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) held or guaranteed by the Small Business Administration.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A)(ii) shall not apply with respect to any small business investment company during any period that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any organization which is exempt from tax under this title (other than a governmental unit) owns more than 25 percent of the capital or profits interest in such company, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) organizations which are exempt from tax under this title (including governmental units other than any agency or instrumentality of the United States) own, in the aggregate, 50 percent or more of the capital or profits interest in such company.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A farmers&rsquo; cooperative organization described in subsection (b)(1) shall be exempt from taxation under this subtitle except as otherwise provided in part I of subchapter T (sec. 1381 and following). Notwithstanding part I of subchapter T (sec. 1381 and following), such an organization shall be considered an organization exempt from income taxes for purposes of any law which refers to organizations exempt from income taxes.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Exempt farmers&rsquo; cooperatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The farmers&rsquo; cooperatives exempt from taxation to the extent provided in subsection (a) are farmers&rsquo;, fruit growers&rsquo;, or like associations organized and operated on a cooperative basis (A) for the purpose of marketing the products of members or other producers, and turning back to them the proceeds of sales, less the necessary marketing expenses, on the basis of either the quantity or the value of the products furnished by them, or (B) for the purpose of purchasing supplies and equipment for the use of members or other persons, and turning over such supplies and equipment to them at actual cost, plus necessary expenses.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Organizations having capital stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Exemption shall not be denied any such association because it has capital stock, if the dividend rate of such stock is fixed at not to exceed the legal rate of interest in the State of incorporation or 8 percent per annum, whichever is greater, on the value of the consideration for which the stock was issued, and if substantially all such stock (other than nonvoting preferred stock, the owners of which are not entitled or permitted to participate, directly or indirectly, in the profits of the association, upon dissolution or otherwise, beyond the fixed dividends) is owned by producers who market their products or purchase their supplies and equipment through the association.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Organizations maintaining reserve</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Exemption shall not be denied any such association because there is accumulated and maintained by it a reserve required by State law or a reasonable reserve for any necessary purpose.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Transactions with nonmembers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Exemption shall not be denied any such association which markets the products of nonmembers in an amount the value of which does not exceed the value of the products marketed for members, or which purchases supplies and equipment for nonmembers in an amount the value of which does not exceed the value of the supplies and equipment purchased for members, provided the value of the purchases made for persons who are neither members nor producers does not exceed 15 percent of the value of all its purchases.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Business for the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Business done for the United States or any of its agencies shall be disregarded in determining the right to exemption under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Netting of losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Exemption shall not be denied any such association because such association computes its net earnings for purposes of determining any amount available for distribution to patrons in the manner described in paragraph (1) of section 1388(j).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Cross reference</h4>
