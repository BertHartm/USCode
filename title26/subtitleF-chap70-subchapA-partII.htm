<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority for making</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary believes that the assessment or collection of a deficiency, as defined in section 6211, will be jeopardized by delay, he shall, notwithstanding the provisions of section 6213(a), immediately assess such deficiency (together with all interest, additional amounts, and additions to the tax provided for by law), and notice and demand shall be made by the Secretary for the payment thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deficiency letters</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the jeopardy assessment is made before any notice in respect of the tax to which the jeopardy assessment relates has been mailed under section 6212(a), then the Secretary shall mail a notice under such subsection within 60 days after the making of the assessment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount assessable before decision of Tax Court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The jeopardy assessment may be made in respect of a deficiency greater or less than that notice of which has been mailed to the taxpayer, despite the provisions of section 6212(c) prohibiting the determination of additional deficiencies, and whether or not the taxpayer has theretofore filed a petition with the Tax Court. The Secretary may, at any time before the decision of the Tax Court is rendered, abate such assessment, or any unpaid portion thereof, to the extent that he believes the assessment to be excessive in amount. The Secretary shall notify the Tax Court of the amount of such assessment, or abatement, if the petition is filed with the Tax <!-- PDFPage:3526 -->Court before the making of the assessment or is subsequently filed, and the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction to redetermine the entire amount of the deficiency and of all amounts assessed at the same time in connection therewith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amount assessable after decision of Tax Court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the jeopardy assessment is made after the decision of the Tax Court is rendered, such assessment may be made only in respect of the deficiency determined by the Tax Court in its decision.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Expiration of right to assess</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A jeopardy assessment may not be made after the decision of the Tax Court has become final or after the taxpayer has filed a petition for review of the decision of the Tax Court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Collection of unpaid amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When the petition has been filed with the Tax Court and when the amount which should have been assessed has been determined by a decision of the Tax Court which has become final, then any unpaid portion, the collection of which has been stayed by bond as provided in section 6863(b) shall be collected as part of the tax upon notice and demand from the Secretary, and any remaining portion of the assessment shall be abated. If the amount already collected exceeds the amount determined as the amount which should have been assessed, such excess shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer as provided in section 6402, without the filing of claim therefor. If the amount determined as the amount which should have been assessed is greater than the amount actually assessed, then the difference shall be assessed and shall be collected as part of the tax upon notice and demand from the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Abatement if jeopardy does not exist</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may abate the jeopardy assessment if he finds that jeopardy does not exist. Such abatement may not be made after a decision of the Tax Court in respect of the deficiency has been rendered or, if no petition is filed with the Tax Court, after the expiration of the period for filing such petition. The period of limitation on the making of assessments and levy or a proceeding in court for collection, in respect of any deficiency, shall be determined as if the jeopardy assessment so abated had not been made, except that the running of such period shall in any event be suspended for the period from the date of such jeopardy assessment until the expiration of the 10th day after the day on which such jeopardy assessment is abated.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Bond to stay collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When an assessment has been made under section 6851, 6852,,<sup><a href="#6863_1_target" name="6863_1">1</a></sup> 6861 or 6862, the collection of the whole or any amount of such assessment may be stayed by filing with the Secretary, within such time as may be fixed by regulations prescribed by the Secretary, a bond in an amount equal to the amount as to which the stay is desired, conditioned upon the payment of the amount (together with interest thereon) the collection of which is stayed, at the time at which, but for the making of such assessment, such amount would be due. Upon the filing of the bond the collection of so much of the amount assessed as is covered by the bond shall be stayed. The taxpayer shall have the right to waive such stay at any time in respect of the whole or any part of the amount covered by the bond, and if as a result of such waiver any part of the amount covered by the bond is paid, then the bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced. If any portion of such assessment is abated, the bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Further conditions in case of income, estate, or gift taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of taxes subject to the jurisdiction of the Tax Court&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Prior to petition to Tax Court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the bond is given before the taxpayer has filed his petition under section 6213(a), the bond shall contain a further condition that if a petition is not filed within the period provided in such section, then the amount, the collection of which is stayed by the bond, will be paid on notice and demand at any time after the expiration of such period, together with interest thereon from the date of the jeopardy notice and demand to the date of notice and demand under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effect of Tax Court decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The bond shall be conditioned upon the payment of so much of such assessment (collection of which is stayed by the bond) as is not abated by a decision of the Tax Court which has become final. If the Tax Court determines that the amount assessed is greater than the amount which should have been assessed, then when the decision of the Tax Court is rendered the bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Stay of sale of seized property pending Tax Court decision</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Where, notwithstanding the provisions of section 6213(a), an assessment has been made under section 6851, 6852, or 6861, the property seized for the collection of the tax shall not be sold&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) before the expiration of the periods described in subsection (c)(1)(A) and (B),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) before the issuance of the notice of deficiency described in section 6851(b) or 6861(b), and the expiration of the period provided in section 6213(a) for filing a petition with the Tax Court, and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Clauses (ii) and (iii) shall not apply in the case of a termination assessment under section 6851 if the taxpayer does not file a return for the taxable year by the due date (determined with regard to any extensions).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such property may be sold if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the taxpayer consents to the sale,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Secretary determines that the expenses of conservation and maintenance will greatly reduce the net proceeds, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the property is of the type described in section 6336.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Review by Tax Court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, but for the application of subparagraph (B), a sale would be prohibited by subparagraph (A)(iii), then the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction to review the Secretary's determination under subparagraph (B) that the property may be sold. Such review may be commenced upon motion by either the Secretary or the taxpayer. An order of the Tax Court disposing of a motion under this paragraph shall be reviewable in the same manner as a decision of the Tax Court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Stay of sale of seized property pending district court determination under section 7429</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where a jeopardy assessment has been made under section 6862(a), the property seized for the collection of the tax shall not be sold&mdash;</p>
