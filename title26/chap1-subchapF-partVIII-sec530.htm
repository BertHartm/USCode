<p class="statutory-body">An education individual retirement account shall be exempt from taxation under this sub<!-- PDFPage:1171 -->title. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the education individual retirement account shall be subject to the taxes imposed by section 511 (relating to imposition of tax on unrelated business income of charitable organizations).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions and special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Education individual retirement account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;education individual retirement account&rdquo; means a trust created or organized in the United States exclusively for the purpose of paying the qualified higher education expenses of an individual who is the designated beneficiary of the trust (and designated as an education individual retirement account at the time created or organized), but only if the written governing instrument creating the trust meets the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) No contribution will be accepted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) unless it is in cash,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) after the date on which such beneficiary attains age 18, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) except in the case of rollover contributions, if such contribution would result in aggregate contributions for the taxable year exceeding $500.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The trustee is a bank (as defined in section 408(n)) or another person who demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the manner in which that person will administer the trust will be consistent with the requirements of this section or who has so demonstrated with respect to any individual retirement plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) No part of the trust assets will be invested in life insurance contracts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The assets of the trust shall not be commingled with other property except in a common trust fund or common investment fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Except as provided in subsection (d)(7), any balance to the credit of the designated beneficiary on the date on which the beneficiary attains age 30 shall be distributed within 30 days after such date to the beneficiary or, if the beneficiary dies before attaining age 30, shall be distributed within 30 days after the date of death of such beneficiary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Qualified higher education expenses</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;qualified higher education expenses&rdquo; has the meaning given such term by section 529(e)(3), reduced as provided in section 25A(g)(2).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the contributor's modified adjusted gross income for such taxable year, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) $95,000 ($150,000 in the case of a joint return), bears to</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If such aggregate distributions exceed such expenses during the taxable year, the amount otherwise includible in gross income under paragraph (1) shall be reduced by the amount which bears the same ratio to the amount which would be includible in gross income under paragraph (1) (without regard to this subparagraph) as the qualified higher education expenses bear to such aggregate distributions.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Election to waive exclusion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A taxpayer may elect to waive the application of this paragraph for any taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Disallowance of excluded amounts as credit or deduction</h4>
