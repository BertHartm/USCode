<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A taxpayer shall be treated as having a reasonable belief with respect to the tax treatment of an item only if such belief&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is based on the facts and law that exist at the time the return of tax which includes such tax treatment is filed, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) relates solely to the taxpayer's chances of success on the merits of such treatment and does not take into account the possibility that a return will not be audited, such treatment will not be raised on audit, or such treatment will be resolved through settlement if it is raised.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is based on unreasonable factual or legal assumptions (including assumptions as to future events),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) unreasonably relies on representations, statements, findings, or agreements of the taxpayer or any other person,</p>
