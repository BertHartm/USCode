For purposes of paragraph (5), the income described therein shall be reduced, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, so as to take into account deductions (including taxes) properly allocable to such income.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exclusion of United States income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a controlled foreign corporation, subpart F income does not include any item of income from sources within the United States which is effectively connected with the conduct by such corporation of a trade or business within the United States unless such item is exempt from taxation (or is subject to a reduced rate of tax) pursuant to a treaty obligation of the United States. For purposes of this subsection, any exemption (or reduction) with respect to the tax imposed by section 884 shall not be taken into account.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The amount included in the gross income of any United States shareholder under section 951(a)(1)(A)(i) for any taxable year and attributable to a qualified activity shall be reduced by the amount of such shareholder's pro rata share of any qualified deficit.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Qualified deficit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The term &ldquo;qualified deficit&rdquo; means any deficit in earnings and profits of the controlled foreign corporation for any prior taxable year which began after December 31, 1986, and for which the controlled foreign corporation was a controlled foreign corporation; but only to the extent such deficit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is attributable to the same qualified activity as the activity giving rise to the income being offset, and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1911 --><p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) has not previously been taken into account under this subparagraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;In determining the deficit attributable to qualified activities described in subclause (II) or (III) of clause (iii), deficits in earnings and profits (to the extent not previously taken into account under this section) for taxable years beginning after 1962 and before 1987 also shall be taken into account. In the case of the qualified activity described in clause (iii)(I), the rule of the preceding sentence shall apply, except that &ldquo;1982&rdquo; shall be substituted for &ldquo;1962&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) in the case of a qualified insurance company, insurance income or foreign personal holding company income, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) in the case of a qualified financial institution, foreign personal holding company income.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Pro rata share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this paragraph, the shareholder's pro rata share of any deficit for any prior taxable year shall be determined under rules similar to rules under section 951(a)(2) for whichever of the following yields the smaller share:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the close of the taxable year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the close of the taxable year in which the deficit arose.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(v) Qualified insurance company</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;qualified insurance company&rdquo; means any controlled foreign corporation predominantly engaged in the active conduct of an insurance business in the taxable year and in the prior taxable years in which the deficit arose.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vi) Qualified financial institution</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(vii) Special rules for insurance income</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">An election may be made under this clause to have section 953(a) applied for purposes of this title without regard to the same country exception under paragraph (1)(A) thereof. Such election, once made, may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Special rules for affiliated groups</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">In the case of an affiliated group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1504 but without regard to section 1504(b)(3) and by substituting &ldquo;more than 50 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;at least 80 percent&rdquo; each place it appears), no election may be made under subclause (I) for any controlled foreign corporation unless such election is made for all other controlled foreign corporations who are members of such group and who were created or organized under the laws of the same country as such controlled foreign corporation. For purposes of clause (v), in determining whether any controlled corporation described in the preceding sentence is a qualified insurance company, all such corporations shall be treated as 1 corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Certain deficits of member of the same chain of corporations may be taken into account</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A controlled foreign corporation may elect to reduce the amount of its subpart F income for any taxable year which is attributable to any qualified activity by the amount of any deficit in earnings and profits of a qualified chain member for a taxable year ending with (or within) the taxable year of such controlled foreign corporation to the extent such deficit is attributable to such activity. To the extent any deficit reduces subpart F income under the preceding sentence, such deficit shall not be taken into account under subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Qualified chain member</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;qualified chain member&rdquo; means, with respect to any controlled foreign corporation, any other corporation which is created or organized under the laws of the same foreign country as the controlled foreign corporation but only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) all the stock of such other corporation (other than directors&rsquo; qualifying shares) is owned at all times during the taxable year in which the deficit arose (directly or through 1 or more corporations other than the common parent) by such controlled foreign corporation, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) all the stock of such controlled foreign corporation (other than directors&rsquo; qualifying shares) is owned at all times during the taxable year in which the deficit arose (directly or through 1 or more corporations other than the common parent) by such other corporation.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Coordination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">This subparagraph shall be applied after subparagraphs (A) and (B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Recharacterization in subsequent taxable years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the subpart F income of any controlled foreign corporation for any taxable year was reduced by reason of paragraph (1)(A), any excess of the earnings and profits of such corporation for any subsequent taxable year over the subpart F income of such foreign corpora<!-- PDFPage:1912 -->tion for such taxable year shall be recharacterized as subpart F income under rules similar to the rules applicable under section 904(f)(5).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule for determining earnings and profits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, earnings and profits of any controlled foreign corporation shall be determined without regard to paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of section 312(n). Under regulations, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent it would increase earnings and profits by an amount which was previously distributed by the controlled foreign corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Income derived from foreign country</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of subsection (a)(5), including regulations which treat income paid through 1 or more entities as derived from a foreign country to which section 901(j) applies if such income was, without regard to such entities, derived from such country.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Increase in basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the basis of a United States shareholder's stock in a controlled foreign corporation, and the basis of property of a United States shareholder by reason of which he is considered under section 958(a)(2) as owning stock of a controlled foreign corporation, shall be increased by the amount required to be included in his gross income under section 951(a) with respect to such stock or with respect to such property, as the case may be, but only to the extent to which such amount was included in the gross income of such United States shareholder. In the case of a United States shareholder who has made an election under section 962 for the taxable year, the increase in basis provided by this subsection shall not exceed an amount equal to the amount of tax paid under this chapter with respect to the amounts required to be included in his gross income under section 951(a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reduction in basis</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the adjusted basis of stock or other property with respect to which a United States shareholder or a United States person receives an amount which is excluded from gross income under section 959(a) shall be reduced by the amount so excluded. In the case of a United States shareholder who has made an election under section 962 for any prior taxable year, the reduction in basis provided by this paragraph shall not exceed an amount equal to the amount received which is excluded from gross income under section 959(a) after the application of section 962(d).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount in excess of basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent that an amount excluded from gross income under section 959(a) exceeds the adjusted basis of the stock or other property with respect to which it is received, the amount shall be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Basis adjustments in stock held by foreign corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if a United States shareholder is treated under section 958(a)(2) as owning stock in a controlled foreign corporation which is owned by another controlled foreign corporation, then adjustments similar to the adjustments provided by subsections (a) and (b) shall be made to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, no part of the earnings and profits of a controlled foreign corporation for any taxable year shall be included in earnings and profits for purposes of sections 952, 955, and 956, if it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such part could not have been distributed by the controlled foreign corporation to United States shareholders who own (within the meaning of section 958(a)) stock of such controlled foreign corporation because of currency or other restrictions or limitations imposed under the laws of any foreign country.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a controlled foreign corporation sells or exchanges stock in any other foreign corporation, gain recognized on such sale or exchange shall be included in the gross income of such controlled foreign corporation as a dividend to the same extent that it would have been so included under section 1248(a) if such controlled foreign corporation were a United States person. For purposes of determining the amount which would have been so includible, the determination of whether such other foreign corporation was a controlled foreign corporation shall be made without regard to the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Same country exception not applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Clause (i) of section 954(c)(3)(A) shall not apply to any amount treated as a dividend by reason of paragraph (1).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Deduction</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a corporation which is a United States shareholder and for which the election under this section is in effect for the taxable year, there shall be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to 85 percent of the cash dividends which are received during such taxable year by such shareholder from controlled foreign corporations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Dividends paid indirectly from controlled foreign corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, within the taxable year for which the election under this section is in effect, a United States shareholder receives a cash distribution from a controlled foreign corporation which is excluded from gross income under section 959(a), such distribution shall be treated for purposes of this section as a cash dividend to the extent of any amount included in income by such United States shareholder under section 951(a)(1)(A) as a result of any cash dividend during such taxable year to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such controlled foreign corporation from another controlled foreign corporation that is in a chain of ownership described in section 958(a), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any other controlled foreign corporation in such chain of ownership from another controlled foreign corporation in such chain of ownership, but only to the extent of cash distributions described in section 959(b) which are made during such taxable year to the controlled foreign corporation from which such United States shareholder received such distribution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of dividends taken into account under subsection (a) shall not exceed the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) $500,000,000,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount shown on the applicable financial statement as earnings permanently reinvested outside the United States, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of an applicable financial statement which fails to show a specific amount of earnings permanently reinvested outside the United States and which shows a specific amount of tax liability attributable to such earnings, the amount equal to the amount of such liability divided by 0.35.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The amounts described in subparagraphs (B) and (C) shall be treated as being zero if there is no such statement or such statement fails to show a specific amount of such earnings or liability, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Dividends must be extraordinary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of dividends taken into account under subsection (a) shall not exceed the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the cash dividends received during the taxable year by such shareholder from controlled foreign corporations, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the annual average for the base period years of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the dividends received during each base period year by such shareholder from controlled foreign corporations,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amounts includible in such shareholder's gross income for each base period year under section 951(a)(1)(B) with respect to controlled foreign corporations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the amounts that would have been included for each base period year but for section 959(a) with respect to controlled foreign corporations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The amount taken into account under clause (iii) for any base period year shall not include any amount which is not includible in gross income by reason of an amount described in clause (ii) with respect to a prior taxable year. Amounts described in subparagraph (B) for any base period year shall be such amounts as shown on the most recent return filed for such year; except that amended returns filed after June 30, 2003, shall not be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reduction of benefit if increase in related party indebtedness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of dividends which would (but for this paragraph) be taken into account under subsection (a) shall be reduced by the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of indebtedness of the controlled foreign corporation to any related person (as defined in section 954(d)(3)) as of the close of the taxable year for which the election under this section is in effect, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of indebtedness of the controlled foreign corporation to any related person (as so defined) as of the close of October 3, 2004.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">All controlled foreign corporations with respect to which the taxpayer is a United States <!-- PDFPage:1948 -->shareholder shall be treated as 1 controlled foreign corporation for purposes of this paragraph. The Secretary may prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent the avoidance of the purposes of this paragraph, including regulations which provide that cash dividends shall not be taken into account under subsection (a) to the extent such dividends are attributable to the direct or indirect transfer (including through the use of intervening entities or capital contributions) of cash or other property from a related person (as so defined) to a controlled foreign corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Requirement to invest in United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (a) shall not apply to any dividend received by a United States shareholder unless the amount of the dividend is invested in the United States pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is approved by the taxpayer's president, chief executive officer, or comparable official before the payment of such dividend and subsequently approved by the taxpayer's board of directors, management committee, executive committee, or similar body, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provides for the reinvestment of such dividend in the United States (other than as payment for executive compensation), including as a source for the funding of worker hiring and training, infrastructure, research and development, capital investments, or the financial stabilization of the corporation for the purposes of job retention or creation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definitions and special rules</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) for purposes of applying subsection (b)(2) to the controlled corporation and the distributing corporation, amounts described in subsection (b)(2)(B) which are received or includible by the distributing corporation or controlled corporation (as the case may be) before the distribution referred to in subclause (I) from a controlled foreign corporation shall be allocated between such corporations in proportion to their respective interests as United States shareholders of such controlled foreign corporation immediately after such distribution.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;Subclause (II) shall not apply if neither the controlled corporation nor the distributing corporation is a United States shareholder of such controlled foreign corporation immediately after such distribution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Dividend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;dividend&rdquo; shall not include amounts includible in gross income as a dividend under section 78, 367, or 1248.
