<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the place of residence of a Member of Congress (including any Delegate and Resident Commissioner) within the State, congressional district, or possession which he represents in Congress shall be considered his home, but amounts expended by such Members within each taxable year for living expenses shall not be deductible for income tax purposes in excess of $3,000.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Charitable contributions and gifts excepted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) for any contribution or gift which would be allowable as a deduction under section 170 were it not for the percentage limitations, the dollar limitations, or the requirements as to the time of payment, set forth in such section.</p>

The burden of proof in respect of the issue, for the purposes of this paragraph, as to whether a payment constitutes an illegal bribe or kickback (or is unlawful under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977) shall be upon the Secretary to the same extent as he bears the burden of proof under section 7454 (concerning the burden of proof when the issue relates to fraud).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other illegal payments</h4>

For purposes of this paragraph, a kickback includes a payment in consideration of the referral of a client, patient, or customer.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;169. Amortization of pollution control facilities</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Allowance of deduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every person, at his election, shall be entitled to a deduction with respect to the amortization of the amortizable basis of any certified pollution control facility (as defined in subsection (d)), based on a period of 60 months. Such amortization deduction shall be an amount, with respect to each month of such period within the taxable year, equal to the amortizable basis of the pollution control facility at the end of such month divided by the number of months (including the month for which the deduction is computed) remaining in the period. Such amortizable basis at the end of the month shall be computed without regard to the amortization deduction for such month. The amortization deduction provided by this section with respect to any month shall be in lieu of the depreciation deduction with respect to such pollution control facility for such month provided by section 167. The 60-month period shall begin, as to any pollution control facility, at the election of the taxpayer, with the month following the month in which such facility was completed or acquired, or with the succeeding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Election of amortization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The election of the taxpayer to take the amortization deduction and to begin the 60-month period with the month following the month in which the facility is completed or acquired, or with the taxable year succeeding the taxable year in which such facility is completed or acquired, shall be made by filing with the Secretary, in such manner, in such form, and within such time, as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe, a statement of such election.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Termination of amortization deduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A taxpayer which has elected under subsection (b) to take the amortization deduction provided in subsection (a) may, at any time after making such election, discontinue the amortization deduction with respect to the remainder of the amortization period, such discontinuance to begin as of the beginning of any month specified by the taxpayer in a notice in writing filed with the Secretary before the beginning of such month. The depreciation deduction provided under section 167 shall be allowed, beginning <!-- PDFPage:681 -->with the first month as to which the amortization deduction does not apply, and the taxpayer shall not be entitled to any further amortization deduction under this section with respect to such pollution control facility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definitions and special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Certified pollution control facility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;certified pollution control facility&rdquo; means a new identifiable treatment facility which is used, in connection with a plant or other property in operation before January 1, 1976, to abate or control water or atmospheric pollution or contamination by removing, altering, disposing, storing, or preventing the creation or omission of pollutants, contaminants, wastes, or heat and which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the State certifying authority having jurisdiction with respect to such facility has certified to the Federal certifying authority as having been constructed, reconstructed, erected, or acquired in conformity with the State program or requirements for abatement or control of water or atmospheric pollution or contamination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Federal certifying authority has certified to the Secretary (i) as being in compliance with the applicable regulations of Federal agencies and (ii) as being in furtherance of the general policy of the United States for cooperation with the States in the prevention and abatement of water pollution under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 466 et seq.), or in the prevention and abatement of atmospheric pollution and contamination under the Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1857 et seq.); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) does not significantly&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) increase the output or capacity, extend the useful life, or reduce the total operating costs of such plant or other property (or any unit thereof), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) alter the nature of the manufacturing or production process or facility.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) State certifying authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;State certifying authority&rdquo; means, in the case of water pollution, the State water pollution control agency as defined in section 13(a) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and, in the case of air pollution, the air pollution control agency as defined in section 302(b) of the Clean Air Act. The term &ldquo;State certifying authority&rdquo; includes any interstate agency authorized to act in place of a certifying authority of the State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Federal certifying authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;Federal certifying authority&rdquo; means, in the case of water pollution, the Secretary of the Interior and, in the case of air pollution, the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) New identifiable treatment facility</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;new identifiable treatment facility&rdquo; includes only tangible property (not including a building and its structural components, other than a building which is exclusively a treatment facility) which is of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167, which is identifiable as a treatment facility, and which is property&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the construction, reconstruction, or erection of which is completed by the taxpayer after December 31, 1968, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) acquired after December 31, 1968, if the original use of the property commences with the taxpayer and commences after such date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In applying this section in the case of property described in clause (i) there shall be taken into account only that portion of the basis which is properly attributable to construction, reconstruction, or erection after December 31, 1968.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certain facilities placed in operation after April 11, 2005</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any facility described in paragraph (1) solely by reason of paragraph (5), subparagraph (A) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;April 11, 2005&rdquo; for &ldquo;December 31, 1968&rdquo; each place it appears therein.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Special rule relating to certain atmospheric pollution control facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any atmospheric pollution control facility which is placed in service after April 11, 2005, and used in connection with an electric generation plant or other property which is primarily coal fired&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) paragraph (1) shall be applied without regard to the phrase &ldquo;in operation before January 1, 1976&rdquo;, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of facility&nbsp;<sup><a href="#169_1_target" name="169_1">1</a></sup> placed in service in connection with a plant or other property placed in operation after December 31, 1975, this section shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;84&rdquo; for &ldquo;60&rdquo; each place it appears in subsections (a) and (b).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Profitmaking abatement works, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal certifying authority shall not certify any property under subsection (d)(1)(B) to the extent it appears that by reason of profits derived through the recovery of wastes or otherwise in the operation of such property, its costs will be recovered over its actual useful life.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Amortizable basis</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;amortizable basis&rdquo; means that portion of the adjusted basis (for determining gain) of a certified pollution control facility which may be amortized under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) If a certified pollution control facility has a useful life (determined as of the first day of the first month for which a deduction is allowable under this section) in excess of 15 years, the amortizable basis of such facility shall be equal to an amount which bears the same ratio to the portion of the adjusted <!-- PDFPage:682 -->basis of such facility, which would be eligible for amortization but for the application of this subparagraph, as 15 bears to the number of years of useful life of such facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The amortizable basis of a certified pollution control facility with respect to which an election under this section is in effect shall not be increased, for purposes of this section, for additions or improvements after the amortization period has begun.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Depreciation deduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The depreciation deduction provided by section 167 shall, despite the provisions of subsection (a), be allowed with respect to the portion of the adjusted basis which is not the amortizable basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">[(h) Repealed. Pub. L. 92&ndash;178, title I, &sect;104(f)(2), Dec. 10, 1971, 85 Stat. 502]</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Life tenant and remainderman</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of property held by one person for life with remainder to another person, the deduction under this section shall be computed as if the life tenant were the absolute owner of the property and shall be allowable to the life tenant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Cross reference</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>For special rule with respect to certain gain derived from the disposition of property the adjusted basis of which is determined with regard to this section, see section 1245.</strong></p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any bond, as defined in subsection (d), the following rules shall apply to the amortizable bond premium (determined under subsection (b)) on the bond:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Taxable bonds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a bond (other than a bond the interest on which is excludable from gross income), the amount of the amortizable bond premium for the taxable year shall be allowed as a deduction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Tax-exempt bonds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any bond the interest on which is excludable from gross income, no deduction shall be allowed for the amortizable bond premium for the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Cross reference</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>For adjustment to basis on account of amortizable bond premium, see section 1016(a)(5).</strong></p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amortizable bond premium</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amount of bond premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (2), the amount of bond premium, in the case of the holder of any bond, shall be determined&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) with reference to the amount of the basis (for determining loss on sale or exchange) of such bond,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) with reference to the amount payable on maturity or on earlier call date, in the case of any bond other than a bond to which clause (ii) applies, or and&nbsp;<sup><a href="#171_1_target" name="171_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) with reference to the amount payable on maturity (or if it results in a smaller amortizable bond premium attributable to the period to earlier call date, with reference to the amount payable on earlier call date), in the case of any bond described in subsection (a)(1) which is acquired after December 31, 1957, and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:711 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) with adjustments proper to reflect unamortized bond premium, with respect to the bond, for the period before the date as of which subsection (a) becomes applicable with respect to the taxpayer with respect to such bond.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In no case shall the amount of bond premium on a convertible bond include any amount attributable to the conversion features of the bond.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount amortizable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amortizable bond premium of the taxable year shall be the amount of the bond premium attributable to such year. In the case of a bond to which paragraph (1)(B)(ii) applies and which has a call date, the amount of bond premium attributable to the taxable year in which the bond is called shall include an amount equal to the excess of the amount of the adjusted basis (for determining loss on sale or exchange) of such bond as of the beginning of the taxable year over the amount received on redemption of the bond or (if greater) the amount payable on maturity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Method of determination</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the determinations required under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be made on the basis of the taxpayer's yield to maturity determined by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) using the taxpayer's basis (for purposes of determining loss on sale or exchange) of the obligation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) compounding at the close of each accrual period (as defined in section 1272(a)(5)).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule where earlier call date is used</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), if the amount payable on an earlier call date is used under paragraph (1)(B)(ii) in determining the amortizable bond premium attributable to the period before the earlier call date, such bond shall be treated as maturing on such date for the amount so payable and then reissued on such date for the amount so payable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of certain bonds acquired in exchange for other property</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a bond is acquired by any person in exchange for other property, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the basis of such bond is determined (in whole or in part) by reference to the basis of such other property,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">for purposes of applying this subsection to such bond while held by such person, the basis of such bond shall not exceed its fair market value immediately after the exchange. A similar rule shall apply in the case of such bond while held by any other person whose basis is determined (in whole or in part) by reference to the basis in the hands of the person referred to in clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule where bond exchanged in reorganization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an exchange by the taxpayer of a bond for another bond if such exchange is a part of a reorganization (as defined in section 368). If any portion of the basis of the taxpayer in a bond transferred in such an exchange is not taken into account in determining bond premium by reason of this paragraph, such portion shall not be taken into account in determining the amount of bond premium on any bond received in the exchange.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Election as to taxable bonds</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Eligibility to elect; bonds with respect to which election permitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of bonds the interest on which is not excludible from gross income, this section shall apply only if the taxpayer has so elected.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Manner and effect of election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The election authorized under this subsection shall be made in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe. If such election is made with respect to any bond (described in paragraph (1)) of the taxpayer, it shall also apply to all such bonds held by the taxpayer at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies and to all such bonds thereafter acquired by him and shall be binding for all subsequent taxable years with respect to all such bonds of the taxpayer, unless, on application by the taxpayer, the Secretary permits him, subject to such conditions as the Secretary deems necessary, to revoke such election. In the case of bonds held by a common trust fund, as defined in section 584(a), the election authorized under this subsection shall be exercisable with respect to such bonds only by the common trust fund. In case of bonds held by an estate or trust, the election authorized under this subsection shall be exercisable with respect to such bonds only by the fiduciary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Bond defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;bond&rdquo; means any bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence of indebtedness, but does not include any such obligation which constitutes stock in trade of the taxpayer or any such obligation of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year, or any such obligation held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Treatment as offset to interest payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in regulations, in the case of any taxable bond&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount of any bond premium shall be allocated among the interest payments on the bond under rules similar to the rules of subsection (b)(3), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in lieu of any deduction under subsection (a), the amount of any premium so allocated to any interest payment shall be applied against (and operate to reduce) the amount of such interest payment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:712 --><p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;taxable bond&rdquo; means any bond the interest of which is not excludable from gross income.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Dealers in tax-exempt securities</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>For special rules applicable, in the case of dealers in securities, with respect to premium attributable to certain wholly tax-exempt securities, see section 75.</strong></p>

<p class="statutory-body">A taxpayer engaged in the business of farming may treat expenditures which are paid or incurred by him during the taxable year for the purpose of soil or water conservation in respect of land used in farming, or for the prevention of erosion of land used in farming, or for endangered species recovery, as expenses which are not chargeable to capital account. The expenditures so treated shall be allowed as a deduction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount deductible under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall not exceed 25 percent of the gross income derived from farming during the taxable year. If for any taxable year the total of the expenditures treated as expenses which are not chargeable to capital account exceeds 25 percent of the gross income derived from farming during the taxable year, such excess shall be deductible for succeeding taxable years in order of time; but the amount deductible under this section for any one such succeeding taxable year (including the expenditures actually paid or incurred during the taxable year) shall not exceed 25 percent of the gross income derived from farming during the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definitions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;land used in farming&rdquo; means land used (before or simultaneously with the expenditures described in paragraph (1)) by the taxpayer or his tenant for the production of crops, fruits, or other agricultural products or for the sustenance of livestock.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Rules applicable to assessments for depreciable property</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amounts treated as paid or incurred over 9-year period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an assessment levied to defray expenditures for property described in clause (ii) of the last sentence of subsection (c)(1), if the amount of such assessment paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the taxable year (determined without the application of this paragraph) is in excess of an amount equal to 10 percent of the aggregate amounts which have been and will be assessed as the taxpayer's share of the expenditures by the district for such property, and if such excess is more than $500, the entire excess shall be treated as paid or incurred ratably over each of the 9 succeeding taxable years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Disposition of land during 9-year period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If paragraph (1) applies to an assessment and the land with respect to which such assessment was made is sold or otherwise disposed of by the taxpayer (other than by the reason of his death) during the 9 succeeding taxable years, any amount of the excess described in paragraph (1) which has not been treated as paid or incurred for a taxable year ending on or before the sale or other disposition shall be added to the adjusted basis of such land immediately prior to its sale or other disposition and shall not thereafter be treated as paid or incurred ratably under paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an activity not engaged in for profit to which subsection (a) applies, there shall be allowed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the deductions which would be allowable under this chapter for the taxable year without regard to whether or not such activity is engaged in for profit, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a deduction equal to the amount of the deductions which would be allowable under this chapter for the taxable year only if such activity were engaged in for profit, but only to the extent that the gross income derived from such activity for the taxable year exceeds the deductions allowable by reason of paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Activity not engaged in for profit defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;activity not engaged in for profit&rdquo; means any activity other than one with respect to which deductions are allowable for the taxable year under section 162 or under paragraph (1) or (2) of section 212.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Presumption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the gross income derived from an activity for 3 or more of the taxable years in the period of 5 consecutive taxable years which ends with the taxable year exceeds the deductions attributable to such activity (determined without regard to whether or not such activity is engaged in for profit), then, unless the Secretary establishes to the contrary, such activity shall be presumed for purposes of this chapter for such taxable year to be an activity engaged in for profit. In the case of an activity which consists in major part of the breeding, training, showing, <!-- PDFPage:746 -->or racing of horses, the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;2&rdquo; for &ldquo;3&rdquo; and &ldquo;7&rdquo; for &ldquo;5&rdquo;.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

For purposes of the preceding sentence, a taxpayer shall be treated as not having engaged in an activity during any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Initial period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the taxpayer makes an election under paragraph (1), the presumption provided by subsection (d) shall apply to each taxable year in the 5-taxable year (or 7-taxable year) period beginning with the taxable year in which the taxpayer first engages in the activity, if the gross income derived from the activity for 3 (or 2 if applicable) or more of the taxable years in such period exceeds the deductions attributable to the activity (determined without regard to whether or not the activity is engaged in for profit).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An election under paragraph (1) shall be made at such time and manner, and subject to such terms and conditions, as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Time for assessing deficiency attributable to activity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a taxpayer makes an election under paragraph (1) with respect to an activity, the statutory period for the assessment of any deficiency attributable to such activity shall not expire before the expiration of 2 years after the date prescribed by law (determined without extensions) for filing the return of tax under chapter 1 for the last taxable year in the period of 5 taxable years (or 7 taxable years) to which the election relates.
