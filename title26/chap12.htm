<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Taxable transfers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A tax, computed as provided in section 2502, is hereby imposed for each calendar year on the transfer of property by gift during such calendar year by any individual resident or nonresident.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Transfers of intangible property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (3), paragraph (1) shall not apply to the transfer of intangible property by a nonresident not a citizen of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (2) shall not apply in the case of a donor who at any time after March 8, 1965, and within the 10-year period ending with the date of transfer lost United States citizenship unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such donor's loss of United States citizenship resulted from the application of section 301(b), 350, or 355&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2501_1_target" name="2501_1">1</a></sup> of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1401(b), 1482, or 1487), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such loss did not have for one of its principal purposes the avoidance of taxes under this subtitle or subtitle A.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary establishes that it is reasonable to believe that an individual's loss of United States citizenship would, but for paragraph (3), result in a substantial reduction for the calendar year in the taxes on the transfer of property by gift, the burden of proving that such loss of citizenship did not have for one of its principal purposes the avoidance of taxes under this subtitle or subtitle A shall be on such individual.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Transfers to political organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the transfer of money or other property to a political organization (within the meaning of section 527(e)(1)) for the use of such organization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certain residents of possessions considered citizens of the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A donor who is a citizen of the United States and a resident of a possession thereof shall, for purposes of the tax imposed by this chapter, be considered a &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; of the United States within the meaning of that term wherever used in this title unless he acquired his United States citizenship solely by reason of (1) his being a citizen of such possession of the United States, or (2) his birth or residence within such possession of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certain residents of possessions considered nonresidents not citizens of the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A donor who is a citizen of the United States and a resident of a possession thereof shall, for purposes of the tax imposed by this chapter, be considered a &ldquo;nonresident not a citizen of the United States&rdquo; within the meaning of that term wherever used in this title, but only if such donor acquired his United States citizenship solely by reason of (1) his being a citizen of such possession of the United States, or (2) his birth or residence within such possession of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Cross references</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>(1) For increase in basis of property acquired by gift for gift tax paid, see section 1015(d).</strong></p>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>(2) For exclusion of transfers of property outside the United States by a nonresident who is not a citizen of the United States, see section 2511(a).</strong></p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Powers created on or before October 21, 1942</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An exercise of a general power of appointment created on or before October 21, 1942, shall be deemed a transfer of property by the individual possessing such power; but the failure to exercise such a power or the complete release of such a power shall not be deemed an exercise thereof. If a general power of appointment created on or before October 21, 1942, has been partially released so that it is no longer a general power of appointment, the subsequent exercise of such power shall not be deemed to be the exercise of a general power of appointment if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such partial release occurred before November 1, 1951, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the donee of such power was under a legal disability to release such power on October 21, 1942, and such partial release occurred not later than six months after the termination of such legal disability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Powers created after October 21, 1942</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The exercise or release of a general power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, shall be deemed a transfer of property by the individual possessing such power.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definition of general power of appointment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;general power of appointment&rdquo; means a power which is exercisable in favor of the individual possessing the power (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;possessor&rdquo;), his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate; except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A power to consume, invade, or appropriate property for the benefit of the possessor which is limited by an ascertainable standard relating to the health, education, support, or maintenance of the possessor shall not be deemed a general power of appointment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A power of appointment created on or before October 21, 1942, which is exercisable by the possessor only in conjunction with another person shall not be deemed a general power of appointment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In the case of a power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, which is exercisable by the possessor only in conjunction with another person&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1787 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if the power is not exercisable by the possessor except in conjunction with the creator of the power&mdash;such power shall not be deemed a general power of appointment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the power is not exercisable by the possessor except in conjunction with a person having a substantial interest, in the property subject to the power, which is adverse to exercise of the power in favor of the possessor&mdash;such power shall not be deemed a general power of appointment. For the purposes of this subparagraph a person who, after the death of the possessor, may be possessed of a power of appointment (with respect to the property subject to the possessor's power) which he may exercise in his own favor shall be deemed as having an interest in the property and such interest shall be deemed adverse to such exercise of the possessor's power;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if (after the application of subparagraphs (A) and (B)) the power is a general power of appointment and is exercisable in favor of such other person&mdash;such power shall be deemed a general power of appointment only in respect of a fractional part of the property subject to such power, such part to be determined by dividing the value of such property by the number of such persons (including the possessor) in favor of whom such power is exercisable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraphs (B) and (C), a power shall be deemed to be exercisable in favor of a person if it is exercisable in favor of such person, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Creation of another power in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, is exercised by creating another power of appointment which, under the applicable local law, can be validly exercised so as to postpone the vesting of any estate or interest in the property which was subject to the first power, or suspend the absolute ownership or power of alienation of such property, for a period ascertainable without regard to the date of the creation of the first power, such exercise of the first power shall, to the extent of the property subject to the second power, be deemed a transfer of property by the individual possessing such power.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Lapse of power</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The lapse of a power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, during the life of the individual possessing the power shall be considered a release of such power. The rule of the preceding sentence shall apply with respect to the lapse of powers during any calendar year only to the extent that the property which could have been appointed by exercise of such lapsed powers exceeds in value the greater of the following amounts:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) $5,000, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 5 percent of the aggregate value of the assets out of which, or the proceeds of which, the exercise of the lapsed powers could be satisfied.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Date of creation of power</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section a power of appointment created by a will executed on or before October 21, 1942, shall be considered a power created on or before such date if the person executing such will dies before July 1, 1949, without having republished such will, by codicil or otherwise, after October 21, 1942.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Allowance of deduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where a donor transfers during the calendar year by gift an interest in property to a donee <!-- PDFPage:1792 -->who at the time of the gift is the donor's spouse, there shall be allowed as a deduction in computing taxable gifts for the calendar year an amount with respect to such interest equal to its value.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Life estate or other terminable interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where, on the lapse of time, on the occurrence of an event or contingency, or on the failure of an event or contingency to occur, such interest transferred to the spouse will terminate or fail, no deduction shall be allowed with respect to such interest&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if the donor retains in himself, or transfers or has transferred (for less than an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth) to any person other than such donee spouse (or the estate of such spouse), an interest in such property, and if by reason of such retention or transfer the donor (or his heirs or assigns) or such person (or his heirs or assigns) may possess or enjoy any part of such property after such termination or failure of the interest transferred to the donee spouse; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the donor immediately after the transfer to the donee spouse has a power to appoint an interest in such property which he can exercise (either alone or in conjunction with any person) in such manner that the appointee may possess or enjoy any part of such property after such termination or failure of the interest transferred to the donee spouse. For purposes of this paragraph, the donor shall be considered as having immediately after the transfer to the donee spouse such power to appoint even though such power cannot be exercised until after the lapse of time, upon the occurrence of an event or contingency, or on the failure of an event or contingency to occur.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">An exercise or release at any time by the donor, either alone or in conjunction with any person, of a power to appoint an interest in property, even though not otherwise a transfer, shall, for purposes of paragraph (1), be considered as a transfer by him. Except as provided in subsection (e), where at the time of the transfer it is impossible to ascertain the particular person or persons who may receive from the donor an interest in property so transferred by him, such interest shall, for purposes of paragraph (1), be considered as transferred to a person other than the donee spouse.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Interest in unidentified assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where the assets out of which, or the proceeds of which, the interest transferred to the donee spouse may be satisfied include a particular asset or assets with respect to which no deduction would be allowed if such asset or assets were transferred from the donor to such spouse, then the value of the interest transferred to such spouse shall, for purposes of subsection (a), be reduced by the aggregate value of such particular assets.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Joint interests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the interest is transferred to the donee spouse as sole joint tenant with the donor or as tenant by the entirety, the interest of the donor in the property which exists solely by reason of the possibility that the donor may survive the donee spouse, or that there may occur a severance of the tenancy, shall not be considered for purposes of subsection (b) as an interest retained by the donor in himself.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Life estate with power of appointment in donee spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where the donor transfers an interest in property, if by such transfer his spouse is entitled for life to all of the income from the entire interest, or all the income from a specific portion thereof, payable annually or at more frequent intervals, with power in the donee spouse to appoint the entire interest, or such specific portion (exercisable in favor of such donee spouse, or of the estate of such donee spouse, or in favor of either, whether or not in each case the power is exercisable in favor of others), and with no power in any other person to appoint any part of such interest, or such portion, to any person other than the donee spouse&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the interest, or such portion, so transferred shall, for purposes of subsection (a) be considered as transferred to the donee spouse, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) no part of the interest, or such portion, so transferred shall, for purposes of subsection (b)(1), be considered as retained in the donor or transferred to any person other than the donee spouse.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">This subsection shall apply only if, by such transfer, such power in the donee spouse to appoint the interest, or such portion, whether exercisable by will or during life, is exercisable by such spouse alone and in all events. For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;specific portion&rdquo; only includes a portion determined on a fractional or percentage basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Election with respect to life estate for donee spouse</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of qualified terminable interest property&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for purposes of subsection (a), such property shall be treated as transferred to the donee spouse, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for purposes of subsection (b)(1), no part of such property shall be considered as retained in the donor or transferred to any person other than the donee spouse.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Qualified terminable interest property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;qualified terminable interest property&rdquo; means any property&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which is transferred by the donor spouse,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in which the donee spouse has a qualifying income interest for life, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to which an election under this subsection applies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certain rules made applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, rules similar to the rules of clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv) of section 2056(b)(7)(B) shall apply and the rules of section 2056(b)(10) shall apply.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Election</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Time and manner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An election under this subsection with respect to any property shall be made on or be<!-- PDFPage:1793 -->fore the date prescribed by section 6075(b) for filing a gift tax return with respect to the transfer (determined without regard to section 6019(2)) and shall be made in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Election irrevocable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An election under this subsection, once made, shall be irrevocable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Treatment of interest retained by donor spouse</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any qualified terminable interest property&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such property shall not be includible in the gross estate of the donor spouse, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any subsequent transfer by the donor spouse of an interest in such property shall not be treated as a transfer for purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Subparagraph (A) not to apply after transfer by donee spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply with respect to any property after the donee spouse is treated as having transferred such property under section 2519, or such property is includible in the donee spouse's gross estate under section 2044.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Treatment of joint and survivor annuities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a joint and survivor annuity where only the donor spouse and donee spouse have the right to receive payments before the death of the last spouse to die&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the donee spouse's interest shall be treated as a qualifying income interest for life,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the donor spouse shall be treated as having made an election under this subsection with respect to such annuity unless the donor spouse otherwise elects on or before the date specified in paragraph (4)(A),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) paragraph (5) and section 2519 shall not apply to the donor spouse's interest in the annuity, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) if the donee spouse dies before the donor spouse, no amount shall be includible in the gross estate of the donee spouse under section 2044 with respect to such annuity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">An election under subparagraph (B), once made, shall be irrevocable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Special rule for charitable remainder trusts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, after the transfer, the donee spouse is the only noncharitable beneficiary (other than the donor) of a qualified remainder trust, subsection (b) shall not apply to the interest in such trust which is transferred to the donee spouse.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;noncharitable beneficiary&rdquo; and &ldquo;qualified charitable remainder trust&rdquo; have the meanings given to such terms by section 2056(b)(8)(B).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Denial of double deduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section or any other provision of this chapter shall allow the value of any interest in property to be deducted under this chapter more than once with respect to the same donor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Disallowance of marital deduction where spouse not citizen</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the spouse of the donor is not a citizen of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no deduction shall be allowed under this section,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) section 2503(b) shall be applied with respect to gifts which are made by the donor to such spouse and with respect to which a deduction would be allowable under this section but for paragraph (1) by substituting &ldquo;$100,000&rdquo; for &ldquo;$10,000&rdquo;, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the principles of sections 2515 and 2515A (as such sections were in effect before their repeal by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981) shall apply, except that the provisions of such section 2515 providing for an election shall not apply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">This subsection shall not apply to any transfer resulting from the acquisition of rights under a joint and survivor annuity described in subsection (f)(6).</p>
