<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;overpayment&rdquo; includes that part of the amount of the payment of any internal revenue tax which is assessed or collected after the expiration of the period of limitation properly applicable thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Excessive credits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the amount allowable as credits under subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 (relating to refundable credits) exceeds the tax imposed by subtitle A (reduced by the credits allowable under subparts A, B, D, G, and H of such part IV), the amount of such excess shall be considered an overpayment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule for credit under section 33</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), any credit allowed under section 33 (relating to withholding of tax on nonresident aliens and on foreign corporations) for any taxable year shall be treated as a credit allowable under subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 only if an election under subsection (g) or (h) of section 6013 is in effect for such taxable year. The preceding sentence shall not apply to any credit so allowed by reason of section 1446.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rule where no tax liability</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6402. Authority to make credits or refunds</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any overpayment, the Secretary, within the applicable period of limitations, may credit the amount of such overpayment, including any interest allowed thereon, against any liability in respect of an internal revenue tax on the part of the person who made the overpayment and shall, subject to subsections (c), (d), and (e) refund any balance to such person.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Credits against estimated tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to prescribe regulations providing for the crediting against the estimated income tax for any taxable year of the amount determined by the taxpayer or the Secretary to be an overpayment of the income tax for a preceding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Offset of past-due support against overpayments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of any overpayment to be refunded to the person making the overpayment shall be reduced by the amount of any past-due support (as defined in section 464(c) of the Social Security Act) owed by that person of which the Secretary has been notified by a State in accordance with section 464 of the Social Security Act. The Secretary shall remit the amount by which the overpayment is so reduced to the State collecting such support and notify the person making the overpayment that so much of the overpayment as was necessary to satisfy his obligation for past-due support has been paid to the State. A reduction under this subsection shall be applied first to satisfy any past-due support which has been assigned to the State under section 402(a)(26)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6402_1_target" name="6402_1">1</a></sup> or 471(a)(17) of the Social Security Act, and shall be applied to satisfy any other past-due support after any other reductions allowed by law (but before a credit against future liability for an internal revenue tax) have been made. This subsection shall be applied to an overpayment prior to its being credited to a person's future liability for an internal revenue tax.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Collection of debts owed to Federal agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon receiving notice from any Federal agency that a named person owes a past-due legally enforceable debt (other than past-due support subject to the provisions of subsection (c)) to such agency, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) reduce the amount of any overpayment payable to such person by the amount of such debt;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) pay the amount by which such overpayment is reduced under subparagraph (A) to such agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) notify the person making such overpayment that such overpayment has been reduced by an amount necessary to satisfy such debt.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Priorities for offset</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any overpayment by a person shall be reduced pursuant to this subsection after such overpayment is reduced pursuant to subsection (c) with respect to past-due support collected pursuant to an assignment under section 402(a)(26)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6402_1_target" name="6402_1">1</a></sup> of the Social Security Act and before such overpayment is reduced pursuant to subsection (e) and before such overpayment is credited to the future liability for tax of such person pursuant to subsection (b). If the Secretary receives notice from a Federal agency or agencies of more than one debt subject to paragraph (1) that is owed by a person to such agency or agencies, any overpayment by such person shall be applied against such debts in the order in which such debts accrued.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of OASDI overpayments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Paragraph (1) shall apply with respect to an OASDI overpayment only if the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 3720A(f) of title 31, United States Code, are met with respect to such overpayment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notice; protection of other persons filing joint return</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of a debt consisting of an OASDI overpayment, if the Secretary determines upon receipt of the notice referred to in paragraph (1) that the refund from which the reduction described in paragraph (1)(A) would be made is based upon a joint return, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) notify each taxpayer filing such joint return that the reduction is being made from a refund based upon such return, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) include in such notification a description of the procedures to be followed, in the case of a joint return, to protect the share of the refund which may be payable to another person.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3116 --><h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Adjustments based on protections given to other taxpayers on joint return</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the other person filing a joint return with the person owing the OASDI overpayment takes appropriate action to secure his or her proper share of the refund subject to reduction under this subsection, the Secretary shall pay such share to such other person.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Application for adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A taxpayer may file an application for a tentative carryback adjustment of the tax for the prior taxable year affected by a net operating loss carryback provided in section 172(b), by a business credit carryback provided in section 39, or by a capital loss carryback provided in subsection (a)(1) or (c) of section 1212, from any taxable year. The application shall be verified in the manner prescribed by section 6065 in the case of a return of such taxpayer and shall be filed, on or after the date of filing for the return for the taxable year of the net operating loss, net capital loss, or unused business credit from which the carryback results and within a period of 12 months after such taxable year or, with respect to any portion of a business credit carryback attributable to a net operating loss carryback or a net capital loss carryback from a subsequent taxable year, in the manner and form required by regulations prescribed by the Secretary. The applications shall set forth in such detail and with such supporting data and explanation as such regulations shall require&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The amount of the net operating loss, net capital loss, or unused business credit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The amount of the tax previously determined for the prior taxable year affected by such carryback, the tax previously determined being ascertained in accordance with the method prescribed in section 1314(a);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The amount of decrease in such tax, attributable to such carryback, such decrease being determined by applying the carryback in the manner provided by law to the items on the basis of which such tax was determined;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The unpaid amount of such tax, not including any amount required to be shown under paragraph (5);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The amount, with respect to the tax for the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year from which the carryback is made, as to which an extension of time for payment under section 6164 is in effect; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Such other information for purposes of carrying out the provisions of this section as may be required by such regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Except for purposes of applying section 6611(f)(4)(B), an application under this subsection shall not constitute a claim for credit or refund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allowance of adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within a period of 90 days from the date on which an application for a tentative carryback adjustment is filed under subsection (a), or from the last day of the month in which falls the last date prescribed by law (including any extension of time granted the taxpayer) for filing the return for the taxable year of the net operating loss, net capital loss, or unused business credit from which such carryback results, whichever is the later, the Secretary shall make, to the extent he deems practicable in such period, a limited examination of the application, to discover omissions and errors of computation therein, and shall determine the amount of the decrease in the tax attributable to such carryback upon the basis of the application and the examination, except that the Secretary may disallow, without further action, any application which he finds contains errors of computation which he deems cannot be corrected by him within such 90-day period or material omissions. Such decrease shall be applied against any unpaid amount of the tax decreased (including any amount of such tax as to which an extension of time under section 6164 is in effect) and any remainder shall be credited against any unsatisfied amount of any tax for the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year of the net operating loss, net capital loss, or unused business credit the time for payment of which tax is extended under section 6164. Any remainder shall, within such 90-day period, be either credited against any tax or installment thereof then due from the taxpayer, or refunded to the taxpayer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Consolidated returns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the corporation seeking a tentative carryback adjustment under this section, made or was required to make a consolidated return, either for the taxable year within which the net operating loss, net capital loss, or unused business credit arises, or for the preceding taxable year affected by such loss or credit, the provisions of this section shall apply only to such extent and subject to such conditions, limitations, and exceptions as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3126 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Tentative refund of tax under claim of right adjustment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Application</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) set forth in such detail and with such supporting data such regulations prescribe&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount of the tax for such taxable year computed without regard to the deduction described in section 1341(a)(2),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of the tax for all prior taxable years for which the decrease in tax provided in section 1341(a)(5)(B) was computed,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the amount determined under section 1341(a)(5)(B),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the amount of the overpayment determined under section 1341(b)(1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) such other information as the Secretary may require.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allowance of adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within a period of 90 days from the date on which an application is filed under paragraph (1) or from the date of the overpayment (determined under section 1341(b)(1)), whichever is later, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) review the application,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) determine the amount of the overpayment, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) apply, credit, or refund such overpayment,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">in a manner similar to the manner provided in subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Consolidated returns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of subsection (c) shall apply to an adjustment under this subsection to the same extent and manner as the Secretary may by regulations provide.</p>
