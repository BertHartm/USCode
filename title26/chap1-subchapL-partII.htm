<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the combined gross amount earned during the taxable year, from investment income and from underwriting income as provided in this subsection, computed on the basis of the underwriting and investment exhibit of the annual statement approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) gain during the taxable year from the sale or other disposition of property, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) all other items constituting gross income under subchapter B, except that, in the case of a mutual fire insurance company exclusively issuing perpetual policies, the amount of single deposit premiums paid to such company shall not be included in gross income,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in the case of a mutual fire or flood insurance company whose principal business is the issuance of policies&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1220 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for which the premium deposits are the same (regardless of the length of the term for which the policies are written), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) under which the unabsorbed portion of such premium deposits not required for losses, expenses, or establishment of reserves is returned or credited to the policyholder on cancellation or expiration of the policy,</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Underwriting income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;underwriting income&rdquo; means the premiums earned on insurance contracts during the taxable year less losses incurred and expenses incurred.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) To the result so obtained, add 80 percent of the unearned premiums on outstanding business at the end of the preceding taxable year and deduct 80 percent of the unearned premiums on outstanding business at the end of the taxable year.</p>

Premiums paid by the subscriber of a mutual flood insurance company described in paragraph (1)(D) or issuing exclusively perpetual policies shall be treated, for purposes of computing the taxable income of such subscriber, in the same manner as premiums paid by a policyholder to a mutual fire insurance company described in subparagraph (C) or (D) of paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) To the results so obtained, add estimated salvage and reinsurance recoverable as of the end of the preceding taxable year and deduct estimated salvage and reinsurance recoverable as of the end of the taxable year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the aggregate amount of deductions provided by sections 243, 244, and 245 for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) dividends (other than 100 percent dividends) received during the taxable year, and</p>

The amount of unearned premiums at the close of 1966 shall be determined without regard to the preceding sentence for the purpose of applying section 832(b)(4) of such Code to 1967. Additions to such a reserve shall not be treated as unearned premiums for any taxable year beginning after 1966.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) If a mortgage guaranty insurance company made additions to a reserve which were so treated as unearned premiums described in paragraph (1), such company, in taxable years beginning after 1966, shall include in gross income (in addition to the items specified in section 832(b)(1) of such Code) the sum of the following amounts until there is included in gross income an amount equal to the aggregate additions to the reserve described in paragraph (1) for taxable years beginning before 1967:</p>
