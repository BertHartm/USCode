<h3 class="section-head">&sect;642. Special rules for credits and deductions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Foreign tax credit allowed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An estate or trust shall be allowed the credit against tax for taxes imposed by foreign countries and possessions of the United States, to the extent allowed by section 901, only in respect of so much of the taxes described in such section as is not properly allocable under such section to the beneficiaries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deduction for personal exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An estate shall be allowed a deduction of $600. A trust which, under its governing instrument, is required to distribute all of its income currently shall be allowed a deduction of $300. All other trusts shall be allowed a deduction of $100. The deductions allowed by this subsection shall be in lieu of the deductions allowed under section 151 (relating to deduction for personal exemption).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Deduction for amounts paid or permanently set aside for a charitable purpose</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an estate or trust (other then&nbsp;<sup><a href="#642_1_target" name="642_1">1</a></sup> a trust meeting the specifications of subpart B), there shall be allowed as a deduction in computing its taxable income (in lieu of the deduction allowed by section 170(a), relating to deduction for charitable, etc., contributions and gifts) any amount of the gross income, without limitation, which pursuant to the terms of the governing instrument is, during the taxable year, paid for a purpose specified in section 170(c) (determined without regard to section 170(c)(2)(A)). If a charitable contribution is paid after the close of such taxable year and on or before the last day of the year following the close of such taxable year, then the trustee or administrator may elect to treat such contribution as paid during such taxable year. The election shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary prescribes by regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amounts permanently set aside</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an estate, and in the case of a trust (other than a trust meeting the specifications of subpart B) required by the terms of its governing instrument to set aside amounts which was&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) created on or before October 9, 1969, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an irrevocable remainder interest is transferred to or for the use of an organization described in section 170(c), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the grantor is at all times after October 9, 1969, under a mental disability to change the terms of the trust; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) established by a will executed on or before October 9, 1969, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the testator dies before October 9, 1972, without having republished the will after October 9, 1969, by codicil or otherwise,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the testator at no time after October 9, 1969, had the right to change the portions of the will which pertain to the trust, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the will is not republished by codicil or otherwise before October 9, 1972, and the testator is on such date and at all times thereafter under a mental disability to republish the will by codicil or otherwise,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">there shall also be allowed as a deduction in computing its taxable income any amount of the gross income, without limitation, which pursuant to the terms of the governing instrument is, during the taxable year, permanently set aside for a purpose specified in section 170(c), or is to be used exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, or for the establishment, acquisition, maintenance, or operation of a public cemetery not operated for profit. In the case of a trust, the preceding sentence shall apply only to gross income earned with respect to amounts transferred to the trust before October 9, 1969, or transferred under a will to which subparagraph (B) applies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Pooled income funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a pooled income fund (as defined in paragraph (5)), there shall also be allowed as a deduction in computing its taxable income any amount of the gross income attributable to gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than 1 year, without limitation, which pursuant to the terms of the governing instrument is, during the taxable year, permanently set aside for a purpose specified in section 170(c).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent that the amount otherwise allowable as a deduction under this subsection consists of gain described in section 1202(a), proper adjustment shall be made for any exclusion allowable to the estate or trust under section 1202. In the case of a trust, the deduction allowed by this subsection shall be subject to section 681 (relating to unrelated business income).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Definition of pooled income fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (3), a pooled income fund is a trust&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to which each donor transfers property, contributing an irrevocable remainder interest in such property to or for the use of an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A) (other than in clauses (vii) or (viii)), and retaining an income interest for the life of one or more beneficiaries (living at the time of such transfer),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in which the property transferred by each donor is commingled with property transferred by other donors who have made or make similar transfers,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) which cannot have investments in securities which are exempt from the taxes imposed by this subtitle,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) which includes only amounts received from transfers which meet the requirements of this paragraph,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) which is maintained by the organization to which the remainder interest is contributed and of which no donor or beneficiary of an income interest is a trustee, and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1126 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) from which each beneficiary of an income interest receives income, for each year for which he is entitled to receive the income interest referred to in subparagraph (A), determined by the rate of return earned by the trust for such year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of determining the amount of any charitable contribution allowable by reason of a transfer of property to a pooled fund, the value of the income interest shall be determined on the basis of the highest rate of return earned by the fund for any of the 3 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year of the fund in which the transfer is made. In the case of funds in existence less than 3 taxable years preceding the taxable year of the fund in which a transfer is made the rate of return shall be deemed to be 6 percent per annum, except that the Secretary may prescribe a different rate of return.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Taxable private foundations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a private foundation which is not exempt from taxation under section 501(a) for the taxable year, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply and the provisions of section 170 shall apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Net operating loss deduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The benefit of the deduction for net operating losses provided by section 172 shall be allowed to estates and trusts under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Deduction for depreciation and depletion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An estate or trust shall be allowed the deduction for depreciation and depletion only to the extent not allowable to beneficiaries under section 167(d) and 611(b).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Amortization deductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The benefit of the deductions for amortization provided by sections 169 and 197 shall be allowed to estates and trusts in the same manner as in the case of an individual. The allowable deduction shall be apportioned between the income beneficiaries and the fiduciary under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Disallowance of double deductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Amounts allowable under section 2053 or 2054 as a deduction in computing the taxable estate of a decedent shall not be allowed as a deduction (or as an offset against the sales price of property in determining gain or loss) in computing the taxable income of the estate or of any other person, unless there is filed, within the time and in the manner and form prescribed by the Secretary, a statement that the amounts have not been allowed as deductions under section 2053 or 2054 and a waiver of the right to have such amounts allowed at any time as deductions under section 2053 or 2054. Rules similar to the rules of the preceding sentence shall apply to amounts which may be taken into account under&nbsp;<sup><a href="#642_2_target" name="642_2">2</a></sup> 2621(a)(2) or 2622(b). This subsection shall not apply with respect to deductions allowed under part II (relating to income in respect of decedents).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Unused loss carryovers and excess deductions on termination available to beneficiaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If on the termination of an estate or trust, the estate or trust has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a net operating loss carryover under section 172 or a capital loss carryover under section 1212, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for the last taxable year of the estate or trust deductions (other than the deductions allowed under subsections (b) or (c)) in excess of gross income for such year,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then such carryover or such excess shall be allowed as a deduction, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to the beneficiaries succeeding to the property of the estate or trust.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Certain distributions by cemetery perpetual care funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a cemetery perpetual care fund which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) was created pursuant to local law by a taxable cemetery corporation for the care and maintenance of cemetery property, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is treated for the taxable year as a trust for purposes of this subchapter,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">any amount distributed by such fund for the care and maintenance of gravesites which have been purchased from the cemetery corporation before the beginning of the taxable year of the trust and with respect to which there is an obligation to furnish care and maintenance shall be considered to be a distribution solely for purposes of sections 651 and 661, but only to the extent that the aggregate amount so distributed during the taxable year does not exceed $5 multiplied by the aggregate number of such gravesites.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Deduction for distributions</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Deduction for personal exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No deduction shall be taken under section 642(b) (relating to deduction for personal exemptions).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Capital gains and losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets shall be excluded to the extent that such gains are allocated to corpus and are not (A) paid, credited, or required to be distributed to any beneficiary during the taxable year, or (B) paid, permanently set aside, or to be used for the purposes specified in section 642(c). Losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets shall be excluded, except to the extent <!-- PDFPage:1129 -->such losses are taken into account in determining the amount of gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets which are paid, credited, or required to be distributed to any beneficiary during the taxable year. The exclusion under section 1202 shall not be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Extraordinary dividends and taxable stock dividends</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes only of subpart B (relating to trusts which distribute current income only), there shall be excluded those items of gross income constituting extraordinary dividends or taxable stock dividends which the fiduciary, acting in good faith, does not pay or credit to any beneficiary by reason of his determination that such dividends are allocable to corpus under the terms of the governing instrument and applicable local law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Tax-exempt interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There shall be included any tax-exempt interest to which section 103 applies, reduced by any amounts which would be deductible in respect of disbursements allocable to such interest but for the provisions of section 265 (relating to disallowance of certain deductions).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Income of foreign trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a foreign trust&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Gross income from sources within the United States shall be determined without regard to section 894 (relating to income exempt under treaty).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Paragraph (3) shall not apply to a foreign trust. In the case of such a trust, there shall be included gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets, reduced by losses from such sales or exchanges to the extent such losses do not exceed gains from such sales or exchanges.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the estate or trust is allowed a deduction under section 642(c), the amount of the modifications specified in paragraphs (5) and (6) shall be reduced to the extent that the amount of income which is paid, permanently set aside, or to be used for the purposes specified in section 642(c) is deemed to consist of items specified in those paragraphs. For this purpose, such amount shall (in the absence of specific provisions in the governing instrument) be deemed to consist of the same proportion of each class of items of income of the estate or trust as the total of each class bears to the total of all classes.</p>

Items of gross income constituting extraordinary dividends or taxable stock dividends which the fiduciary, acting in good faith, determines to be allocable to corpus under the terms of the governing instrument and applicable local law shall not be considered income.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by allocating between the estate or trust and its beneficiaries any credit allowable under section 31(c) (on the basis of their respective shares of any such payment taken into account under this subchapter),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by treating each beneficiary to whom such credit is allocated as if an amount equal to such credit has been paid to him by the estate or trust, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) by allowing the estate or trust a deduction in an amount equal to the credit so allocated to beneficiaries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Treatment of property distributed in kind</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Basis of beneficiary</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Inclusion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (b), there shall be included in the gross income of a beneficiary to whom an amount specified in section 661(a) is paid, credited, or required to be distributed (by an estate or trust described in section 661), the sum of the following amounts:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amounts required to be distributed currently</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of income for the taxable year required to be distributed currently to such beneficiary, whether distributed or not. If the amount of income required to be distributed currently to all beneficiaries exceeds the distributable net income (computed without the deduction allowed by section 642(c), relating to deduction for charitable, etc., purposes) of the estate or trust, then, in lieu of the amount provided in the preceding sentence, there shall be included in the gross income of the beneficiary an amount which bears the same ratio to distributable net income (as so computed) as the amount of income required to be distributed currently to such beneficiary bears to the amount required to be distributed currently to all beneficiaries. For purposes of this section, the phrase &ldquo;the amount of income for the taxable year required to be distributed currently&rdquo; includes any amount required to be paid out of income or corpus to the extent such amount is paid out of income for such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other amounts distributed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All other amounts properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed to such beneficiary for the taxable year. If the sum of&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1136 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of income for the taxable year required to be distributed currently to all beneficiaries, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) all other amounts properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed to all beneficiaries</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">exceeds the distributable net income of the estate or trust, then, in lieu of the amount provided in the preceding sentence, there shall be included in the gross income of the beneficiary an amount which bears the same ratio to distributable net income (reduced by the amounts specified in (A)) as the other amounts properly paid, credited or required to be distributed to the beneficiary bear to the other amounts properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed to all beneficiaries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Character of amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amounts determined under subsection (a) shall have the same character in the hands of the beneficiary as in the hands of the estate or trust. For this purpose, the amounts shall be treated as consisting of the same proportion of each class of items entering into the computation of distributable net income as the total of each class bears to the total distributable net income of the estate or trust unless the terms of the governing instrument specifically allocate different classes of income to different beneficiaries. In the application of the preceding sentence, the items of deduction entering into the computation of distributable net income (including the deduction allowed under section 642(c)) shall be allocated among the items of distributable net income in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. In the application of this subsection to the amount determined under paragraph (1) of subsection (a), distributable net income shall be computed without regard to any portion of the deduction under section 642(c) which is not attributable to income of the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Different taxable years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the taxable year of a beneficiary is different from that of the estate or trust, the amount to be included in the gross income of the beneficiary shall be based on the distributable net income of the estate or trust and the amounts properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed to the beneficiary during any taxable year or years of the estate or trust ending within or with his taxable year.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Character of distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Amounts distributed by a charitable remainder annuity trust or by a charitable remainder unitrust shall be considered as having the following characteristics in the hands of a beneficiary to whom is paid the annuity described in subsection (d)(1)(A) or the payment described in subsection (d)(2)(A):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) First, as amounts of income (other than gains, and amounts treated as gains, from the sale or other disposition of capital assets) includible in gross income to the extent of such income of the trust for the year and such undistributed income of the trust for prior years;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definitions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Charitable remainder annuity trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, a charitable remainder annuity trust is a trust&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) from which a sum certain (which is not less than 5 percent of the initial net fair market value of all property placed in trust) is to be paid, not less often than annually, to one or more persons (at least one of which is not an organization described in section 170(c) and, in the case of individuals, only to an individual who is living at the time of the creation of the trust) for a term of years (not in excess of 20 years) or for the life or lives of such individual or individuals,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) from which no amount other than the payments described in subparagraph (A) may be paid to or for the use of any person other than an organization described in section 170(c), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) following the termination of the payments described in subparagraph (A), the remainder interest in the trust is to be transferred to, or for the use of, an organization described in section 170(c) or is to be retained by the trust for such a use.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Charitable remainder unitrust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, a charitable remainder unitrust is a trust&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) from which a fixed percentage (which is not less than 5 percent) of the net fair market value of its assets, valued annually, is to be paid, not less often than annually, to one or more persons (at least one of which is not an organization described in section 170(c) and, in the case of individuals, only to an individual who is living at the time of the creation of the trust) for a term of years (not in excess of 20 years) or for the life or lives of such individual or individuals,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of the trust income, if such amount is less than the amount required to be distributed under paragraph (2)(A), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any amount of the trust income which is in excess of the amount required to be distributed under paragraph (2)(A), to the extent that (by reason of subparagraph (A)) the aggregate of the amounts paid in prior years <!-- PDFPage:1138 -->was less than the aggregate of such required amounts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Valuation for purposes of charitable contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining the amount of any charitable contribution, the remainder interest of a charitable remainder annuity trust or charitable remainder unitrust shall be computed on the basis that an amount equal to 5 percent of the net fair market value of its assets (or a greater amount, if required under the terms of the trust instrument) is to be distributed each year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Certain contingencies permitted</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>

Such additional amount shall be equal to the taxes (other than the tax imposed by section 55) imposed on the trust for such preceding taxable year attributable to the undistributed net income. For purposes of this subsection, the undistributed net income and the taxes imposed on the trust for such preceding taxable year attributable to such undistributed net income shall be computed without regard to such accumulation distribution and without regard to any accumulation distribution determined for any succeeding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Pro rata portion of taxes deemed distributed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any portion of an accumulation distribution for any taxable year is deemed under subsection (a) to be an amount within the meaning of paragraph (2) of section 661(a) distributed on the last day of any preceding taxable year and such portion of the accumulation distribution is less than the undistributed net income for such preceding taxable year, the trust shall be deemed to have distributed on the last day of such preceding taxable year an additional amount within the meaning of paragraph (2) of section 661(a). Such additional amount shall be equal to the taxes (other than the tax imposed by section 55) imposed on the trust for such taxable year attributable to the undistributed net income multiplied by the ratio of the portion of the accumulation distribution to the undistributed net income of the trust for such year. For purposes of this subsection, the undistributed net income and the taxes imposed on the trust for such preceding taxable year attributable to such undistributed net income shall be computed without regard to the accumulation distribution and without regard to any accumulation distribution determined for any succeeding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rule when information is not available</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If adequate records are not available to determine the proper application of this subpart to an amount distributed by a trust, such amount shall be deemed to be an accumulation distribution consisting of undistributed net income earned during the earliest preceding taxable year of the trust in which it can be established that the trust was in existence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Denial of refund to trusts and beneficiaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No refund or credit shall be allowed to a trust or a beneficiary of such trust for any preceding taxable year by reason of a distribution deemed to have been made by such trust in such year under this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;667. Treatment of amounts deemed distributed by trust in preceding years</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The total of the amounts which are treated under section 666 as having been distributed by a trust in a preceding taxable year shall be included in the income of a beneficiary of the trust when paid, credited, or required to be distributed to the extent that such total would have been included in the income of such beneficiary under section 662(a)(2) (and, with respect to any tax-exempt interest to which section 103 applies, under section 662(b)) if such total had been paid to such beneficiary on the last day of such preceding taxable year. The tax imposed by this subtitle on a beneficiary for a taxable year in which any such amount is included in his income shall be determined only as provided in this section and shall consist of the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a partial tax computed on the taxable income reduced by an amount equal to the total of such amounts, at the rate and in the manner as if this section had not been enacted,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a partial tax determined as provided in subsection (b) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of a foreign trust, the interest charge determined as provided in section 668.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Tax on distribution</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The partial tax imposed by subsection (a)(2) shall be determined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by determining the number of preceding taxable years of the trust on the last day of which an amount is deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by taking from the 5 taxable years immediately preceding the year of the accumulation distribution the 1 taxable year for which the beneficiary's taxable income was the highest and the 1 taxable year for which his taxable income was the lowest,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) by adding to the beneficiary's taxable income for each of the 3 taxable years remaining after the application of subparagraph (B) an amount determined by dividing the amount deemed distributed under section 666 and required to be included in income under subsection (a) by the number of preceding taxable years determined under subparagraph (A), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) by determining the average increase in tax for the 3 taxable years referred to in subparagraph (C) resulting from the application of such subparagraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The partial tax imposed by subsection (a)(2) shall be the excess (if any) of the average increase in tax determined under subparagraph (D), multiplied by the number of preceding taxable years determined under subparagraph (A), over the amount of taxes (other than the amount of taxes described in section 665(d)(2)) deemed distributed to the beneficiary under sections 666(b) and (c).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of loss years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the taxable income of the beneficiary for any taxable year shall be deemed to be not less than zero.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certain preceding taxable years not taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), if the amount of the undistributed net income deemed distributed in any preceding taxable year of the trust is less than 25 percent of the amount of the accumulation distribution divided by the number of preceding taxable years to which the accumulation distribution is allocated under section 666(a), the number of preceding taxable years of the trust with respect to which an amount is deemed distributed to a beneficiary under section 666(a) shall be determined without regard to such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Effect of other accumulation distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In computing the partial tax under paragraph (1) for any beneficiary, the income of such beneficiary for each of his prior taxable years shall include amounts previously deemed distributed to such beneficiary in such year under section 666 as a result of prior accumulation distributions (whether from the same or another trust).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Multiple distributions in the same taxable year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of accumulation distributions made from more than one trust which are includible in the income of a beneficiary in the same taxable year, the distributions shall be deemed to have been made consecutively in whichever order the beneficiary shall determine.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Adjustment in partial tax for estate and generation-skipping transfer taxes attributable to partial tax</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The partial tax shall be reduced by an amount which is equal to the pre-death portion of the partial tax multiplied by a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the numerator of which is that portion of the tax imposed by chapter 11 or 13, <!-- PDFPage:1143 -->as the case may be, which is attributable (on a proportionate basis) to amounts included in the accumulation distribution, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the denominator of which is the amount of the accumulation distribution which is subject to the tax imposed by chapter 11 or 13, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Partial tax determined without regard to this paragraph</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;partial tax&rdquo; means the partial tax imposed by subsection (a)(2) determined under this subsection without regard to this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Pre-death portion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the pre-death portion of the partial tax shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the partial tax as the portion of the accumulation distribution which is attributable to the period before the date of the death of the decedent or the date of the generation-skipping transfer bears to the total accumulation distribution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rule for multiple trusts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, in the same prior taxable year of the beneficiary in which any part of the accumulation distribution from a trust (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as &ldquo;third trust&rdquo;) is deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed to such beneficiary, some part of prior distributions by each of 2 or more other trusts is deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed to such beneficiary, then subsections (b) and (c) of section 666 shall not apply with respect to such part of the accumulation distribution from such third trust.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Accumulation distributions from trust not taken into account unless they equal or exceed $1,000</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), an accumulation distribution from a trust to a beneficiary shall be taken into account only if such distribution, when added to any prior accumulation distributions from such trust which are deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed to such beneficiary for the same prior taxable year of the beneficiary, equals or exceeds $1,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rules for foreign trust</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Foreign tax deemed paid by beneficiary</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining the increase in tax under subsection (b)(1)(D) for any computation year, the taxes described in section 665(d)(2) which are deemed distributed under section 666(b) or (c) and added under subsection (b)(1)(C) to the taxable income of the beneficiary for any computation year shall, except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), be treated as a credit against the increase in tax for such computation year under subsection (b)(1)(D).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Deduction in lieu of credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the beneficiary did not choose the benefits of subpart A of part III of subchapter N with respect to the computation year, the beneficiary may in lieu of treating the amounts described in subparagraph (A) (without regard to subparagraph (C)) as a credit may treat such amounts as a deduction in computing the beneficiary's taxable income under subsection (b)(1)(C) for the computation year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitation on credit; retention of character</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Limitation on credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of determining under subparagraph (A) the amount treated as a credit for any computation year, the limitations under subpart A of part III of subchapter N shall be applied separately with respect to amounts added under subsection (b)(1)(C) to the taxable income of the beneficiary for such computation year. For purposes of computing the increase in tax under subsection (b)(1)(D) for any computation year for which the beneficiary did not choose the benefits of subpart A of part III of subchapter N, the beneficiary shall be treated as having chosen such benefits for such computation year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Retention of character</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The items of income, deduction, and credit of the Trust shall retain their character (subject to the application of section 904(f)(5)) to the extent necessary to apply this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Computation year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;computation year&rdquo; means any of the three taxable years remaining after application of subsection (b)(1)(B).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Retention of character of amounts distributed from accumulation trust to nonresident aliens and foreign corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a distribution from a trust to a nonresident alien individual or to a foreign corporation, the first sentence of subsection (a) shall be applied as if the reference to the determination of character under section 662(b) applied to all amounts instead of just to tax-exempt interest.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of the tax determined under section 667(a), the interest charge is an amount equal to 6 percent of the partial tax computed under section 667(b) multiplied by a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the numerator of which is the sum of the number of taxable years between each taxable year to which the distribution is allocated under section 666(a) and the taxable year of the distribution (counting in each case the taxable year to which the distribution is allocated but not counting the taxable year of the distribution), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the denominator of which is the number of taxable years to which the distribution is allocated under section 666(a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The total amount of the interest charge shall not, when added to the total partial tax computed under section 667(b), exceed the amount of the accumulation distribution (other than the amount of tax deemed distributed by section 666(b) or (c)) in respect of which such partial tax was determined.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Interest charge not deductible</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The interest charge determined under this section shall not be allowed as a deduction for purposes of any tax imposed by this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The grantor shall be treated as the owner of any portion of a trust in which he has a reversionary interest in either the corpus or the income therefrom, if, as of the inception of that portion of the trust, the value of such interest exceeds 5 percent of the value of such portion.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reversionary interest taking effect at death of minor lineal descendant beneficiary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any beneficiary who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is a lineal descendant of the grantor, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) holds all of the present interests in any portion of a trust,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the grantor shall not be treated under subsection (a) as the owner of such portion solely by reason of a reversionary interest in such portion which takes effect upon the death of such beneficiary before such beneficiary attains age 21.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rule for determining value of reversionary interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (a), the value of the grantor's reversionary interest shall be determined by assuming the maximum exercise of discretion in favor of the grantor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Postponement of date specified for reacquisition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any postponement of the date specified for the reacquisition of possession or enjoyment of the reversionary interest shall be treated as a new transfer in trust commencing with the date on which the postponement is effective and terminating with the date prescribed by the postponement. However, income for any period shall not be included in the income of the grantor by reason of the preceding sentence if such income would not be so includible in the absence of such postponement.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The grantor shall be treated as the owner of any portion of a trust in respect of which the beneficial enjoyment of the corpus or the income therefrom is subject to a power of disposi<!-- PDFPage:1148 -->tion, exercisable by the grantor or a nonadverse party, or both, without the approval or consent of any adverse party.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exceptions for certain powers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) shall not apply to the following powers regardless of by whom held:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Power to apply income to support of a dependent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A power described in section 677(b) to the extent that the grantor would not be subject to tax under that section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Power affecting beneficial enjoyment only after occurrence of event</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A power, the exercise of which can only affect the beneficial enjoyment of the income for a period commencing after the occurrence of an event such that a grantor would not be treated as the owner under section 673 if the power were a reversionary interest; but the grantor may be treated as the owner after the occurrence of the event unless the power is relinquished.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Power exercisable only by will</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A power exercisable only by will, other than a power in the grantor to appoint by will the income of the trust where the income is accumulated for such disposition by the grantor or may be so accumulated in the discretion of the grantor or a nonadverse party, or both, without the approval or consent of any adverse party.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Power to allocate among charitable beneficiaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A power to determine the beneficial enjoyment of the corpus or the income therefrom if the corpus or income is irrevocably payable for a purpose specified in section 170(c) (relating to definition of charitable contributions).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Power to distribute corpus</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A power to distribute corpus either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to or for a beneficiary or beneficiaries or to or for a class of beneficiaries (whether or not income beneficiaries) provided that the power is limited by a reasonably definite standard which is set forth in the trust instrument; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to or for any current income beneficiary, provided that the distribution of corpus must be chargeable against the proportionate share of corpus held in trust for the payment of income to the beneficiary as if the corpus constituted a separate trust.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A power does not fall within the powers described in this paragraph if any person has a power to add to the beneficiary or beneficiaries or to a class of beneficiaries designated to receive the income or corpus, except where such action is to provide for after-born or after-adopted children.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Power to withhold income temporarily</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A power to distribute or apply income to or for any current income beneficiary or to accumulate the income for him, provided that any accumulated income must ultimately be payable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to the beneficiary from whom distribution or application is withheld, to his estate, or to his appointees (or persons named as alternate takers in default of appointment) provided that such beneficiary possesses a power of appointment which does not exclude from the class of possible appointees any person other than the beneficiary, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on termination of the trust, or in conjunction with a distribution of corpus which is augmented by such accumulated income, to the current income beneficiaries in shares which have been irrevocably specified in the trust instrument.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Accumulated income shall be considered so payable although it is provided that if any beneficiary does not survive a date of distribution which could reasonably have been expected to occur within the beneficiary's lifetime, the share of the deceased beneficiary is to be paid to his appointees or to one or more designated alternate takers (other than the grantor or the grantor's estate) whose shares have been irrevocably specified. A power does not fall within the powers described in this paragraph if any person has a power to add to the beneficiary or beneficiaries or to a class of beneficiaries designated to receive the income or corpus except where such action is to provide for after-born or after-adopted children.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Power to withhold income during disability of a beneficiary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A power exercisable only during&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the existence of a legal disability of any current income beneficiary, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the period during which any income beneficiary shall be under the age of 21 years,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">to distribute or apply income to or for such beneficiary or to accumulate and add the income to corpus. A power does not fall within the powers described in this paragraph if any person has a power to add to the beneficiary or beneficiaries or to a class of beneficiaries designated to receive the income or corpus, except where such action is to provide for after-born or after-adopted children.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Power to allocate between corpus and income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A power to allocate receipts and disbursements as between corpus and income, even though expressed in broad language.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exception for certain powers of independent trustees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) shall not apply to a power solely exercisable (without the approval or consent of any other person) by a trustee or trustees, none of whom is the grantor, and no more than half of whom are related or subordinate parties who are subservient to the wishes of the grantor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to distribute, apportion, or accumulate income to or for a beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to, for, or within a class of beneficiaries; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to pay out corpus to or for a beneficiary or beneficiaries or to or for a class of beneficiaries (whether or not income beneficiaries).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A power does not fall within the powers described in this subsection if any person has a <!-- PDFPage:1149 -->power to add to the beneficiary or beneficiaries or to a class of beneficiaries designated to receive the income or corpus, except where such action is to provide for after-born or after-adopted children. For periods during which an individual is the spouse of the grantor (within the meaning of section 672(e)(2)), any reference in this subsection to the grantor shall be treated as including a reference to such individual.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Power to allocate income if limited by a standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) shall not apply to a power solely exercisable (without the approval or consent of any other person) by a trustee or trustees, none of whom is the grantor or spouse living with the grantor, to distribute, apportion, or accumulate income to or for a beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to, for, or within a class of beneficiaries, whether or not the conditions of paragraph (6) or (7) of subsection (b) are satisfied, if such power is limited by a reasonably definite external standard which is set forth in the trust instrument. A power does not fall within the powers described in this subsection if any person has a power to add to the beneficiary or beneficiaries or to a class of beneficiaries designated to receive the income or corpus except where such action is to provide for after-born or after-adopted children.</p>
