<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of section 72, the term &ldquo;modified endowment contract&rdquo; means any contract meeting the requirements of section 7702&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is entered into on or after June 21, 1988, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) fails to meet the 7-pay test of subsection (b), or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) which is received in exchange for a contract described in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) 7-pay test</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (a), a contract fails to meet the 7-pay test of this subsection if the accumulated amount paid under the contract at any time during the 1st 7 contract years exceeds the sum of the net level premiums which would have been paid on or before such time if the contract provided for paid-up future benefits after the payment of 7 level annual premiums.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Computational rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in this subsection, the determination under subsection (b) of the 7 level annual premiums shall be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) as of the time the contract is issued, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by applying the rules of section 7702(b)(2) and of section 7702(e) (other than <!-- PDFPage:2782 -->paragraph (2)(C) thereof), except that the death benefit provided for the 1st contract year shall be deemed to be provided until the maturity date without regard to any scheduled reduction after the 1st 7 contract years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reduction in benefits during 1st 7 years</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If there is a reduction in benefits under the contract within the 1st 7 contract years, this section shall be applied as if the contract had originally been issued at the reduced benefit level.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Reductions attributable to nonpayment of premiums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any reduction in benefits attributable to the nonpayment of premiums due under the contract shall not be taken into account under subparagraph (A) if the benefits are reinstated within 90 days after the reduction in such benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of material changes</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If there is a material change in the benefits under (or in other terms of) the contract which was not reflected in any previous determination under this section, for purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such contract shall be treated as a new contract entered into on the day on which such material change takes effect, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) appropriate adjustments shall be made in determining whether such contract meets the 7-pay test of subsection (b) to take into account the cash surrender value under the contract.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of certain benefit increases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;material change&rdquo; includes any increase in the death benefit under the contract or any increase in, or addition of, a qualified additional benefit under the contract. Such term shall not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any increase which is attributable to the payment of premiums necessary to fund the lowest level of the death benefit and qualified additional benefits payable in the 1st 7 contract years (determined after taking into account death benefit increases described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 7702(e)(2)) or to crediting of interest or other earnings (including policyholder dividends) in respect of such premiums, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to the extent provided in regulations, any cost-of-living increase based on an established broad-based index if such increase is funded ratably over the remaining period during which premiums are required to be paid under the contract.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule for contracts with death benefits of $10,000 or less</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a contract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which provides an initial death benefit of $10,000 or less, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which requires at least 7 nondecreasing annual premium payments,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">each of the 7 level annual premiums determined under subsection (b) (without regard to this paragraph) shall be increased by $75. For purposes of this paragraph, the contract involved and all contracts previously issued to the same policyholder by the same company shall be treated as one contract.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Regulatory authority for certain collection expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may by regulations prescribe rules for taking into account expenses solely attributable to the collection of premiums paid more frequently than annually.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Treatment of certain contracts with more than one insured</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a contract provides a death benefit which is payable only upon the death of 1 insured following (or occurring simultaneously with) the death of another insured, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there is a reduction in such death benefit below the lowest level of such death benefit provided under the contract during the 1st 7 contract years,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">this section shall be applied as if the contract had originally been issued at the reduced benefit level.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Distributions affected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a contract fails to meet the 7-pay test of subsection (b), such contract shall be treated as failing to meet such requirements only in the case of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) distributions during the contract year in which the failure takes effect and during any subsequent contract year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, distributions (not described in paragraph (1)) in anticipation of such failure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of the preceding sentence, any distribution which is made within 2 years before the failure to meet the 7-pay test shall be treated as made in anticipation of such failure.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amount paid</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;amount paid&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the premiums paid under the contract, reduced by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) amounts to which section 72(e) applies (determined without regard to paragraph (4)(A) thereof) but not including amounts includible in gross income.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of certain premiums returned</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, in order to comply with the requirements of subsection (b), any portion of any premium paid during any contract year is returned by the insurance company (with interest) within 60 days after the end of such contract year, the amount so returned (excluding interest) shall be deemed to reduce the sum of the premiums paid under the contract during such contract year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Interest returned includible in gross income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding the provisions of section 72(e), the amount of any interest returned as <!-- PDFPage:2783 -->provided in subparagraph (B) shall be includible in the gross income of the recipient.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Contract year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;contract year&rdquo; means the 12-month period beginning with the 1st month for which the contract is in effect, and each 12-month period beginning with the corresponding month in subsequent calendar years.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this title, except as provided in subsection (c), a publicly traded partnership shall be treated as a corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Publicly traded partnership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;publicly traded partnership&rdquo; means any partnership if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) interests in such partnership are traded on an established securities market, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) interests in such partnership are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exception for partnerships with passive-type income</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (a) shall not apply to any publicly traded partnership for any taxable year if such partnership met the gross income requirements of paragraph (2) for such taxable year and each preceding taxable year beginning after December 31, 1987, during which the partnership (or any predecessor) was in existence. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a partnership shall not be treated as being in existence during any period before the 1st taxable year in which such partnership (or a predecessor) was a publicly traded partnership.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Gross income requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A partnership meets the gross income requirements of this paragraph for any taxable year if 90 percent or more of the gross income of such partnership for such taxable year consists of qualifying income.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exception not to apply to certain partnerships which could qualify as regulated investment companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to any partnership which would be described in section 851(a) if such partnership were a domestic corporation. To the extent provided in regulations, the preceding sentence shall not apply to any partnership a principal activity of which is the buying and selling of commodities (not described in section 1221(1)), or options, futures, or forwards with respect to commodities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Qualifying income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the term &ldquo;qualifying income&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) dividends,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) real property rents,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) gain from the sale or other disposition of real property (including property described in section 1221(1)),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) income and gains derived from the exploration, development, mining or production, processing, refining, transportation (including pipelines transporting gas, oil, or products thereof), or the marketing of any mineral or natural resource (including fertilizer, geothermal energy, and timber),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) any gain from the sale or disposition of a capital asset (or property described in section 1231(b)) held for the production of income described in any of the foregoing subparagraphs of this paragraph, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) in the case of a partnership described in the second sentence of subsection (c)(3), income and gains from commodities (not described in section 1221(1)) or futures, forwards, and options with respect to commodities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (E), the term &ldquo;mineral or natural resource&rdquo; means any product of a character with respect to which a deduction for depletion is allowable under section 611; except that such term shall not include any product described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 613(b)(7).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain interest not qualified</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Interest shall not be treated as qualifying income if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such interest is derived in the conduct of a financial or insurance business, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such interest would be excluded from the term &ldquo;interest&rdquo; under section 856(f).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Real property rent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;real property rent&rdquo; means amounts which would qualify as rent from real property under section 856(d) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such section were applied without regard to paragraph (2)(C) thereof (relating to independent contractor requirements), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for a partner would not be considered as owned under section 318(a)(3)(A) by the partnership unless 5 percent or more (by value) <!-- PDFPage:2785 -->of the interests in such partnership are owned, directly or indirectly, by or for such partner.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Certain income qualifying under regulated investment company or real estate trust provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;qualifying income&rdquo; also includes any income which would qualify under section 851(b)(2) or 856(c)(2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Special rule for determining gross income from certain real property sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of the sale or other disposition of real property described in section 1221(1), gross income shall not be reduced by inventory costs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Inadvertent terminations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a partnership fails to meet the gross income requirements of subsection (c)(2),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary determines that such failure was inadvertent,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) no later than a reasonable time after the discovery of such failure, steps are taken so that such partnership once more meets such gross income requirements, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) such partnership agrees to make such adjustments (including adjustments with respect to the partners) or to pay such amounts as may be required by the Secretary with respect to such period,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then, notwithstanding such failure, such entity shall be treated as continuing to meet such gross income requirements for such period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Effect of becoming corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As of the 1st day that a partnership is treated as a corporation under this section, for purposes of this title, such partnership shall be treated as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) transferring all of its assets (subject to its liabilities) to a newly formed corporation in exchange for the stock of the corporation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) distributing such stock to its partners in liquidation of their interests in the partnership.</p>
