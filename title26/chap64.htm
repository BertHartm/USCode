<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Liens for estate tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c)&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Upon gross estate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Unless the estate tax imposed by chapter 11 is sooner paid in full, or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time, it shall be a lien upon the gross estate of the decedent for 10 years from the date of death, except that such part of the gross estate as is used for the payment of charges against the estate and expenses of its administration, allowed by any court having jurisdiction thereof, shall be divested of such lien.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Liability of transferees and others</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the estate tax imposed by chapter 11 is not paid when due, then the spouse, transferee, trustee (except the trustee of an employees&rsquo; trust which meets the requirements of section 401(a)), surviving tenant, person in possession of the property by reason of the exercise, nonexercise, or release of a power of appointment, or beneficiary, who receives, or has on the date of the decedent's death, property included in the gross estate under sections 2034 to 2042, inclusive, to the extent of the value, at the time of the decedent's death, of such property, shall be personally liable for such tax. Any part of such property transferred by (or transferred by a transferee of) such spouse, transferee, trustee, surviving tenant, person in possession, or beneficiary, to a purchaser or holder of a security interest shall be divested of the lien provided in paragraph (1) and a like lien shall then attach to all the property of <!-- PDFPage:2476 -->such spouse, transferee, trustee, surviving tenant, person in possession, or beneficiary, or transferee of any such person, except any part transferred to a purchaser or a holder of a security interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Continuance after discharge of fiduciary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of section 2204 (relating to discharge of fiduciary from personal liability) shall not operate as a release of any part of the gross estate from the lien for any deficiency that may thereafter be determined to be due, unless such part of the gross estate (or any interest therein) has been transferred to a purchaser or a holder of a security interest, in which case such part (or such interest) shall not be subject to a lien or to any claim or demand for any such deficiency, but the lien shall attach to the consideration received from such purchaser or holder of a security interest, by the heirs, legatees, devisees, or distributees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Lien for gift tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), unless the gift tax imposed by chapter 12 is sooner paid in full or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time, such tax shall be a lien upon all gifts made during the period for which the return was filed, for 10 years from the date the gifts are made. If the tax is not paid when due, the donee of any gift shall be personally liable for such tax to the extent of the value of such gift. Any part of the property comprised in the gift transferred by the donee (or by a transferee of the donee) to a purchaser or holder of a security interest shall be divested of the lien imposed by this subsection and such lien, to the extent of the value of such gift, shall attach to all the property (including after-acquired property) of the donee (or the transferee) except any part transferred to a purchaser or holder of a security interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The lien imposed by subsection (a) or (b) shall not be valid as against a mechanic's lienor and, subject to the conditions provided by section 6323(b) (relating to protection for certain interests even though notice filed), shall not be valid with respect to any lien or interest described in section 6323(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a lien imposed by subsection (a) or (b) is not valid as against a lien or security interest, the priority of such lien or security interest shall extend to any item described in section 6323(e) (relating to priority of interest and expenses) to the extent that, under local law, such item has the same priority as the lien or security interest to which it relates.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6324A. Special lien for estate tax deferred under section 6166</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any estate with respect to which an election has been made under section 6166, if the executor makes an election under this section (at such time and in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe) and files the agreement referred to in subsection (c), the deferred amount (plus any interest, additional amount, addition to tax, assessable penalty, and costs attributable to the deferred amount) shall be a lien in favor of the United States on the section 6166 lien property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Section 6166 lien property</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;section 6166 lien property&rdquo; means interests in real and other property to the extent such interests&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) can be expected to survive the deferral period, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) are designated in the agreement referred to in subsection (c).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Maximum value of required property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The maximum value of the property which the Secretary may require as section 6166 lien property with respect to any estate shall be a value which is not greater than the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the deferred amount, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the required interest amount.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the value of any property shall be determined as of the date prescribed by section 6151(a) for payment of the tax imposed by chapter 11 and shall be determined by taking into account any encumbrance such as a lien under section 6324B.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Partial substitution of bond for lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the value required as section 6166 lien property pursuant to paragraph (2) exceeds the value of the interests in property covered by the agreement referred to in subsection (c), the Secretary may accept bond in an amount equal to such excess conditioned on the payment of the amount extended in accordance with the terms of such extension.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The agreement referred to in this subsection is a written agreement signed by each person in being who has an interest (whether or not in possession) in any property designated in such agreement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consenting to the creation of the lien under this section with respect to such property, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) designating a responsible person who shall be the agent for the beneficiaries of the estate and for the persons who have consented to the creation of the lien in dealings with the Secretary on matters arising under section 6166 or this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirement that lien be filed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The lien imposed by this section shall not be valid as against any purchaser, holder of a security interest, mechanic's lien, or judgment lien creditor until notice thereof which meets the requirements of section 6323(f) has been filed by the Secretary. Such notice shall not be required to be refiled.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Period of lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The lien imposed by this section shall arise at the time the executor is discharged from liability under section 2204 (or, if earlier, at the time notice is filed pursuant to paragraph (1)) and shall continue until the liability for the deferred amount is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Priorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Even though notice of a lien imposed by this section has been filed as provided in paragraph (1), such lien shall not be valid&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Real property tax and special assessment liens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent provided in section 6323(b)(6).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Real property subject to a mechanic's lien for repairs and improvement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any real property subject to a lien for repair or improvement, as against a mechanic's lienor.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Real property construction or improvement financing agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">As against any security interest set forth in paragraph (3) of section 6323(c) (whether such security interest came into existence before or after tax lien filing).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Subparagraphs (B) and (C) shall not apply to any security interest which came into existence after the date on which the Secretary filed notice (in a manner similar to notice filed under section 6323(f)) that payment of the deferred amount has been accelerated under section 6166(g).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Lien to be in lieu of section 6324 lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If there is a lien under this section on any property with respect to any estate, there shall not be any lien under section 6324 on such property with respect to the same estate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Additional lien property required in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If at any time the value of the property covered by the agreement is less than the unpaid portion of the deferred amount and the required interest amount, the Secretary may require the addition of property to the agreement (but he may not require under this paragraph that the value of the property covered by the agreement exceed such unpaid portion). If property having the required value is not added to the property covered by the agreement (or if other security equal to the re<!-- PDFPage:2478 -->quired value is not furnished) within 90 days after notice and demand therefor by the Secretary, the failure to comply with the preceding sentence shall be treated as an act accelerating payment of the installments under section 6166(g).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Lien to be in lieu of bond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may not require under section 6165 the furnishing of any bond for the payment of any tax to which an agreement which meets the requirements of subsection (c) applies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Deferred amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;deferred amount&rdquo; means the aggregate amount deferred under section 6166 (determined as of the date prescribed by section 6151(a) for payment of the tax imposed by chapter 11).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Required interest amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;required interest amount&rdquo; means the aggregate amount of interest which will be payable over the first 4 years of the deferral period with respect to the deferred amount (determined as of the date prescribed by section 6151(a) for the payment of the tax imposed by chapter 11).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Deferral period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;deferral period&rdquo; means the period for which the payment of tax is deferred pursuant to the election under section 6166.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Application of definitions in case of deficiencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a deficiency, a separate deferred amount, required interest amount, and deferral period shall be determined as of the due date of the first installment after the deficiency is prorated to installments under section 6166.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6325. Release of lien or discharge of property</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Release of lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary shall issue a certificate of release of any lien imposed with respect to any internal revenue tax not later than 30 days after the day on which&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Liability satisfied or unenforceable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary finds that the liability for the amount assessed, together with all interest in respect thereof, has been fully satisfied or has become legally unenforceable; or</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Bond accepted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There is furnished to the Secretary and accepted by him a bond that is conditioned upon the payment of the amount assessed, together with all interest in respect thereof, within the time prescribed by law (including any extension of such time), and that is in accordance with such requirements relating to terms, conditions, and form of the bond and sureties thereon, as may be specified by such regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Discharge of property</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Property double the amount of the liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to any lien imposed under this chapter if the Secretary finds that the fair market value of that part of such property remaining subject to the lien is at least double the amount of the unsatisfied liability secured by such lien and the amount of all other liens upon such property which have priority over such lien.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Part payment; interest of United States valueless</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to the lien if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) there is paid over to the Secretary in partial satisfaction of the liability secured by the lien an amount determined by the Secretary, which shall not be less than the value, as determined by the Secretary, of the interest of the United States in the part to be so discharged, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary determines at any time that the interest of the United States in the part to be so discharged has no value.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In determining the value of the interest of the United States in the part to be so discharged, the Secretary shall give consideration to the value of such part and to such liens thereon as have priority over the lien of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Substitution of proceeds of sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to the lien if such part of the property is sold and, pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary, the proceeds of such sale are to be held, as a fund subject to the liens and claims of the United States, in the same manner and with the same priority as such liens and claims had with respect to the discharged property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Estate or gift tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may issue a certificate of discharge of any or all of the property subject to any lien imposed by section 6324 if the Secretary finds that the liability secured by such lien has been fully satisfied or provided for.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Subordination of lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may issue a certificate of subordination of any lien imposed by this chapter upon any part of the property subject to such lien if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is paid over to the Secretary an amount equal to the amount of the lien or interest to which the certificate subordinates the lien of the United States,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary believes that the amount realizable by the United States from the property to which the certificate relates, or from any other property subject to the lien, will ultimately be increased by reason of the issuance of such certificate and that the ultimate collection of the tax liability will be facilitated by such subordination, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of any lien imposed by section 6324B, if the Secretary determines that the United States will be adequately secured after such subordination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Nonattachment of lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary determines that, because of confusion of names or otherwise, any person (other than the person against whom the tax was assessed) is or may be injured by the appearance that a notice of lien filed under section 6323 refers to such person, the Secretary may issue a certificate that the lien does not attach to the property of such person.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2480 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Effect of certificate</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Conclusiveness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), if a certificate is issued pursuant to this section by the Secretary and is filed in the same office as the notice of lien to which it relates (if such notice of lien has been filed) such certificate shall have the following effect:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a certificate of release, such certificate shall be conclusive that the lien referred to in such certificate is extinguished;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a certificate of discharge, such certificate shall be conclusive that the property covered by such certificate is discharged from the lien;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of a certificate of subordination, such certificate shall be conclusive that the lien or interest to which the lien of the United States is subordinated is superior to the lien of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in the case of a certificate of nonattachment, such certificate shall be conclusive that the lien of the United States does not attach to the property of the person referred to in such certificate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Revocation of certificate of release or nonattachment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that a certificate of release or nonattachment of a lien imposed by section 6321 was issued erroneously or improvidently, or if a certificate of release of such lien was issued pursuant to a collateral agreement entered into in connection with a compromise under section 7122 which has been breached, and if the period of limitation on collection after assessment has not expired, the Secretary may revoke such certificate and reinstate the lien&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by mailing notice of such revocation to the person against whom the tax was assessed at his last known address, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by filing notice of such revocation in the same office in which the notice of lien to which it relates was filed (if such notice of lien had been filed).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Such reinstated lien (i) shall be effective on the date notice of revocation is mailed to the taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (A), but not earlier than the date on which any required filing of notice of revocation is filed in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (B), and (ii) shall have the same force and effect (as of such date), until the expiration of the period of limitation on collection after assessment, as a lien imposed by section 6321 (relating to lien for taxes).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certificates void under certain conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, any lien imposed by this chapter shall attach to any property with respect to which a certificate of discharge has been issued if the person liable for the tax reacquires such property after such certificate has been issued.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Filing of certificates and notices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a certificate or notice issued pursuant to this section may not be filed in the office designated by State law in which the notice of lien imposed by section 6321 is filed, such certificate or notice shall be effective if filed in the office of the clerk of the United States district court for the judicial district in which such office is situated.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6331. Levy and distraint</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the same within 10 days after notice and demand, it shall be lawful for the Secretary to collect such tax (and such further sum as shall be sufficient to cover the expenses of the levy) by levy upon all property and rights to property (except such property as is exempt under section 6334) belonging to such person or on which there is a lien provided in this chapter for the payment of such tax. Levy may be made upon the accrued salary or wages of any officer, employee, or elected official, of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States or the District of Columbia, by serving a notice of levy on the employer (as defined in section 3401(d)) of such officer, employee, or elected official. If the Secretary makes a finding that the collection of such tax is in jeopardy, notice and demand for immediate payment of such tax may be made by the Secretary and, upon failure or refusal to pay such tax, collection thereof by levy shall be lawful without regard to the 10-day period provided in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Seizure and sale of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;levy&rdquo; as used in this title includes the power of distraint and seizure by any means. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a levy shall extend only to property possessed and obligations existing at the time thereof. In any case in which the Secretary may levy upon property or rights to property, he may seize and sell such property or rights to property (whether real or personal, tangible or intangible).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Successive seizures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any property or right to property upon which levy has been made by virtue of subsection (a) is not sufficient to satisfy the claim of the United States for which levy is made, the Secretary may, thereafter, and as often as may be necessary, proceed to levy in like manner upon any other property liable to levy of the person against whom such claim exists, until the amount due from him, together with all expenses, is fully paid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Requirement of notice before levy</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Levy may be made under subsection (a) upon the salary or wages or other property of any person with respect to any unpaid tax only after the Secretary has notified such person in writing of his intention to make such levy.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) 30-day requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The notice required under paragraph (1) shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) given in person,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) left at the dwelling or usual place of business of such person, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) sent by certified or registered mail to such persons's last known address,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">no less than 30 days before the day of the levy.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Jeopardy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a levy if the Secretary has made a finding under the last sentence of subsection (a) that the collection of tax is in jeopardy.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Information included with notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The notice required under paragraph (1) shall include a brief statement which sets forth in simple and nontechnical terms&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the provisions of this title relating to levy and sale of property,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the procedures applicable to the levy and sale of property under this title,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the administrative appeals available to the taxpayer with respect to such levy and sale and the procedures relating to such appeals,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the alternatives available to taxpayers which could prevent levy on the property (including installment agreements under section 6159),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the provisions of this title relating to redemption of property and release of liens on property, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the procedures applicable to the redemption of property and the release of a lien on property under this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Continuing levy on salary and wages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The effect of a levy on salary or wages payable to or received by a taxpayer shall be continuous from the date such levy is first made until such levy is released under section 6343.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Uneconomical levy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No levy may be made on any property if the amount of the expenses which the Secretary estimates (at the time of levy) would be incurred by the Secretary with respect to the levy and sale of such property exceeds the fair market value of such property at the time of levy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Levy on appearance date of summons</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No levy may be made on the property of any person on any day on which such person (or officer or employee of such person) is required to appear in response to a summons issued by the Secretary for the purpose of collecting any underpayment of tax.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) No application in case of jeopardy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply if the Secretary finds that the collection of tax is in jeopardy.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6332. Surrender of property subject to levy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, any person in possession of (or obligated with respect to) property or rights to property subject to levy upon which a levy has been made shall, upon demand of the Secretary, surrender such property or rights (or discharge such obligation) to the Secretary, except such part of the property or rights as is, at the time of such demand, subject to an attachment or execution under any judicial process.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rule for life insurance and endowment contracts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A levy on an organization with respect to a life insurance or endowment contract issued by such organization shall, without necessity for the surrender of the contract document, constitute a demand by the Secretary for payment of the amount described in paragraph (2) and the exercise of the right of the person against whom the tax is assessed to the advance of such amount. Such organization shall pay over such amount 90 days after service of notice of levy. Such notice shall include a certification by the Secretary that a copy of such notice has been mailed to the person against whom the tax is assessed at his last known address.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Satisfaction of levy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such levy shall be deemed to be satisfied if such organization pays over to the Secretary the amount which the person against whom the tax is assessed could have had advanced to him by such organization on the date prescribed in paragraph (1) for the satisfaction of such levy, increased by the amount of any advance (including contractual interest thereon) made to such person on or after the date such <!-- PDFPage:2484 -->organization had actual notice or knowledge (within the meaning of section 6323(i)(1)) of the existence of the lien with respect to which such levy is made, other than an advance (including contractual interest thereon) made automatically to maintain such contract in force under an agreement entered into before such organization had such notice or knowledge.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Enforcement proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The satisfaction of a levy under paragraph (2) shall be without prejudice to any civil action for the enforcement of any lien imposed by this title with respect to such contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rule for banks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any bank (as defined in section 408(n)) shall surrender (subject to an attachment or execution under judicial process) any deposits (including interest thereon) in such bank only after 21 days after service of levy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Enforcement of levy</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Extent of personal liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any person who fails or refuses to surrender any property or rights to property, subject to levy, upon demand by the Secretary, shall be liable in his own person and estate to the United States in a sum equal to the value of the property or rights not so surrendered, but not exceeding the amount of taxes for the collection of which such levy has been made, together with costs and interest on such sum at the underpayment rate established under section 6621 from the date of such levy (or, in the case of a levy described in section 6331(d)(3), from the date such person would otherwise have been obligated to pay over such amounts to the taxpayer). Any amount (other than costs) recovered under this paragraph shall be credited against the tax liability for the collection of which such levy was made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Penalty for violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to the personal liability imposed by paragraph (1), if any person required to surrender property or rights to property fails or refuses to surrender such property or rights to property without reasonable cause, such person shall be liable for a penalty equal to 50 percent of the amount recoverable under paragraph (1). No part of such penalty shall be credited against the tax liability for the collection of which such levy was made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect of honoring levy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person in possession of (or obligated with respect to) property or rights to property subject to levy upon which a levy has been made who, upon demand by the Secretary, surrenders such property or rights to property (or discharges such obligation) to the Secretary (or who pays a liability under subsection (d)(1)) shall be discharged from any obligation or liability to the delinquent taxpayer and any other person with respect to such property or rights to property arising from such surrender or payment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Person defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;person,&rdquo; as used in subsection (a), includes an officer or employee of a corporation or a member or employee of a partnership, who as such officer, employee, or member is under a duty to surrender the property or rights to property, or to discharge the obligation.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Notice of seizure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As soon as practicable after seizure of property, notice in writing shall be given by the Secretary to the owner of the property (or, in the case of personal property, the possessor thereof), or shall be left at his usual place of abode or business if he has such within the internal revenue district where the seizure is made. If the owner cannot be readily located, or has no dwelling or place of business within such district, the notice may be mailed to his last known address. Such notice shall specify the sum demanded and shall contain, in the case of personal property, an account of the property seized and, in the case of real property, a de<!-- PDFPage:2488 -->scription with reasonable certainty of the property seized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notice of sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall as soon as practicable after the seizure of the property give notice to the owner, in the manner prescribed in subsection (a), and shall cause a notification to be published in some newspaper published or generally circulated within the county wherein such seizure is made, or if there be no newspaper published or generally circulated in such county, shall post such notice at the post office nearest the place where the seizure is made, and in not less than two other public places. Such notice shall specify the property to be sold, and the time, place, manner, and conditions of the sale thereof. Whenever levy is made without regard to the 10-day period provided in section 6331(a), public notice of sale of the property seized shall not be made within such 10-day period unless section 6336 (relating to sale of perishable goods) is applicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Sale of indivisible property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any property liable to levy is not divisible, so as to enable the Secretary by sale of a part thereof to raise the whole amount of the tax and expenses, the whole of such property shall be sold.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Time and place of sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The time of sale shall not be less than 10 days nor more than 40 days from the time of giving public notice under subsection (b). The place of sale shall be within the county in which the property is seized, except by special order of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Manner and conditions of sale</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Determinations relating to minimum price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before the sale of property seized by levy, the Secretary shall determine&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a minimum price for which such property shall be sold (taking into account the expense of making the levy and conducting the sale), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) whether, on the basis of criteria prescribed by the Secretary, the purchase of such property by the United States at such minimum price would be in the best interest of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Sale to highest bidder at or above minimum price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, at the sale, one or more persons offer to purchase such property for not less than the amount of the minimum price, the property shall be declared sold to the highest bidder.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Property deemed sold to United States at minimum price in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If no person offers the amount of the minimum price for such property at the sale and the Secretary has determined that the purchase of such property by the United States would be in the best interest of the United States, the property shall be declared to be sold to the United States at such minimum price.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Release to owner in other cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, at the sale, the property is not declared sold under subparagraph (B) or (C), the property shall be released to the owner thereof and the expense of the levy and sale shall be added to the amount of tax for the collection of which the levy was made. Any property released under this subparagraph shall remain subject to any lien imposed by subchapter C.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional rules applicable to sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall by regulations prescribe the manner and other conditions of the sale of property seized by levy. If one or more alternative methods or conditions are permitted by regulations, the Secretary shall select the alternatives applicable to the sale. Such regulations shall provide:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) That the sale shall not be conducted in any manner other than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) by public auction, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by public sale under sealed bids.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) In the case of the seizure of several items of property, whether such items shall be offered separately, in groups, or in the aggregate; and whether such property shall be offered both separately (or in groups) and in the aggregate, and sold under whichever method produces the highest aggregate amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Whether the announcement of the minimum price determined by the Secretary may be delayed until the receipt of the highest bid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Whether payment in full shall be required at the time of acceptance of a bid, or whether a part of such payment may be deferred for such period (not to exceed 1 month) as may be determined by the Secretary to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The extent to which methods (including advertising) in addition to those prescribed in subsection (b) may be used in giving notice of the sale.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Under what circumstances the Secretary may adjourn the sale from time to time (but such adjournments shall not be for a period to exceed in all 1 month).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Payment of amount bid</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If payment in full is required at the time of acceptance of a bid and is not then and there paid, the Secretary shall forthwith proceed to again sell the property in the manner provided in this subsection. If the conditions of the sale permit part of the payment to be deferred, and if such part is not paid within the prescribed period, suit may be instituted against the purchaser for the purchase price or such part thereof as has not been paid, together with interest at the rate of 6 percent per annum from the date of the sale; or, in the discretion of the Secretary, the sale may be declared by the Secretary to be null and void for failure to make full payment of the purchase price and the property may again be advertised and sold as provided in subsections (b) and (c) and this subsection.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Release of levy and notice of release</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the Secretary shall release the levy upon all, or part of, the property or rights to property levied upon and shall promptly notify the person upon whom such levy was made (if any) that such levy has been released if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the liability for which such levy was made is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) release of such levy will facilitate the collection of such liability,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the taxpayer has entered into an agreement under section 6159 to satisfy such liability by means of installment payments, unless such agreement provides otherwise,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the Secretary has determined that such levy is creating an economic hardship due to the financial condition of the taxpayer, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the fair market value of the property exceeds such liability and release of the levy on a part of such property could be made without hindering the collection of such liability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (C), the Secretary is not required to release such levy if such release would jeopardize the secured creditor status of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Expedited determination on certain business property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any tangible personal property essential in carrying on the trade or business of the taxpayer, the Secretary shall provide for an expedited determination under paragraph (1) if levy on such tangible personal property would prevent the taxpayer from carrying on such trade or business.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Subsequent levy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The release of levy on any property under paragraph (1) shall not prevent any subsequent levy on such property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Return of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary determines that property has been wrongfully levied upon, it shall be lawful for the Secretary to return&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the specific property levied upon,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an amount of money equal to the amount of money levied upon, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an amount of money equal to the amount of money received by the United States from a sale of such property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Property may be returned at any time. An amount equal to the amount of money levied upon or received from such sale may be returned at any time before the expiration of 9 months from the date of such levy. For purposes of paragraph (3), if property is declared purchased by the United States at a sale pursuant to section 6335(e) (relating to manner and conditions of sale), the United States shall be treated as having received an amount of money equal to the minimum price determined pursuant to such section or (if larger) the amount received by the United States from the resale of such property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Interest shall be allowed and paid at the overpayment rate established under section 6621&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in a case described in subsection (b)(2), from the date the Secretary receives the money to a date (to be determined by the Secretary) preceding the date of return by not more than 30 days, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in a case described in subsection (b)(3), from the date of the sale of the property to a date (to be determined by the Secretary) preceding the date of return by not more than 30 days.</p>
