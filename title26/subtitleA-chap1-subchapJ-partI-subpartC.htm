<h3 class="section-head">&sect;662. Inclusion of amounts in gross income of beneficiaries of estates and trusts accumulating income or distributing corpus</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Inclusion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (b), there shall be included in the gross income of a beneficiary to whom an amount specified in section 661(a) is paid, credited, or required to be distributed (by an estate or trust described in section 661), the sum of the following amounts:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amounts required to be distributed currently</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of income for the taxable year required to be distributed currently to such beneficiary, whether distributed or not. If the amount of income required to be distributed currently to all beneficiaries exceeds the distributable net income (computed without the deduction allowed by section 642(c), relating to deduction for charitable, etc., purposes) of the estate or trust, then, in lieu of the amount provided in the preceding sentence, there shall be included in the gross income of the beneficiary an amount which bears the same ratio to distributable net income (as so computed) as the amount of income required to be distributed currently to such beneficiary bears to the amount required to be distributed currently to all beneficiaries. For purposes of this section, the phrase &ldquo;the amount of income for the taxable year required to be distributed currently&rdquo; includes any amount required to be paid out of income or corpus to the extent such amount is paid out of income for such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other amounts distributed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All other amounts properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed to such beneficiary for the taxable year. If the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of income for the taxable year required to be distributed currently to all beneficiaries, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) all other amounts properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed to all beneficiaries</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">exceeds the distributable net income of the estate or trust, then, in lieu of the amount provided in the preceding sentence, there shall be included in the gross income of the beneficiary an amount which bears the same ratio to distributable net income (reduced by the amounts specified in (A)) as the other amounts properly paid, credited or required to be distributed to the beneficiary bear to the other amounts properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed to all beneficiaries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Character of amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amounts determined under subsection (a) shall have the same character in the hands of the beneficiary as in the hands of the estate or trust. For this purpose, the amounts shall be treated as consisting of the same proportion of each class of items entering into the computation of distributable net income as the total of each class bears to the total distributable net income of the estate or trust unless the terms of the governing instrument specifically allocate different classes of income to different beneficiaries. In the application of the preceding sentence, the items of deduction entering into the computation of distributable net income (including the deduction allowed under section 642(c)) shall be allocated among the items of distributable net income in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. In the application of this subsection to the amount determined under paragraph (1) of subsection (a), distributable net income shall be computed without regard to any portion of the deduction under section 642(c) which is not attributable to income of the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Different taxable years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the taxable year of a beneficiary is different from that of the estate or trust, the amount to <!-- PDFPage:1612 -->be included in the gross income of the beneficiary shall be based on the distributable net income of the estate or trust and the amounts properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed to the beneficiary during any taxable year or years of the estate or trust ending within or with his taxable year.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Exclusions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There shall not be included as amounts falling within section 661(a) or 662(a)&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Gifts, bequests, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any amount which, under the terms of the governing instrument, is properly paid or credited as a gift or bequest of a specific sum of money or of specific property and which is paid or credited all at once or in not more than 3 installments. For this purpose an amount which can be paid or credited only from the income of the estate or trust shall not be considered as a gift or bequest of a specific sum of money.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Charitable, etc., distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any amount paid or permanently set aside or otherwise qualifying for the deduction provided in section 642(c) (computed without regard to sections 508(d), 681, and 4948(c)(4)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Denial of double deduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any amount paid, credited, or distributed in the taxable year, if section 651 or section 661 applied to such amount for a preceding taxable year of an estate or trust because credited or required to be distributed in such preceding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Distributions in first sixty-five days of taxable year</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If within the first 65 days of any taxable year of an estate or a trust, an amount is properly paid or credited, such amount shall be considered paid or credited on the last day of the preceding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall apply with respect to any taxable year of an estate or a trust only if the executor of such estate or the fiduciary of such trust (as the case may be) elects, in such manner and at such time as the Secretary prescribes by regulations, to have paragraph (1) apply for such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Separate shares treated as separate estates or trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the sole purpose of determining the amount of distributable net income in the application of sections 661 and 662, in the case of a single trust having more than one beneficiary, substantially separate and independent shares of different beneficiaries in the trust shall be treated as separate trusts. Rules similar to the rules of the preceding provisions of this subsection shall apply to treat substantially separate and independent shares of different beneficiaries in an estate having more than 1 beneficiary as separate estates. The existence of such substantially separate and independent shares and the manner of treatment as separate trusts or estates, including the application of subpart D, shall be determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
