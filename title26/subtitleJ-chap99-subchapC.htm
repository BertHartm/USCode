<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Creation of plan</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As soon as practicable after the enactment date, the settlors shall create a separate private plan which shall be known as the United Mine Workers of America 1992 Benefit Plan. For purposes of this title, the 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan shall be treated as an organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a). The settlors shall be responsible for designing the structure, administration and terms of the 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan, and for appointment and removal of the members of the board of trustees. The board of trustees shall initially <!-- PDFPage:3819 -->consist of five members and shall thereafter be the number set by the settlors.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of plan</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule for 1993 plan</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The plan described in section 402(h)(2)(C) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1232(h)(2)(C)) shall include any amount transferred to the plan under subsections (h) and (i) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1232).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Coverage requirement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Managed care</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan shall develop managed care and cost containment rules which shall be applicable to the payment of benefits under this subsection. Application of such rules shall not cause the plan to be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subsection. Such rules shall preserve freedom of choice while reinforcing managed care network use by allowing a point of service decision as to whether a network medical provider will be used. Major elements of such rules may include, but are not limited to, elements described in paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Major elements of rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Elements described in this paragraph are&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) limiting benefit payments to physicians to the allowable charge under title XVIII of the Social Security Act, while protecting beneficiaries from balance billing by providers,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) utilizing, in the claims payment function &ldquo;appropriateness of service&rdquo; protocols under title XVIII of the Social Security Act if more stringent,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) creating mandatory utilization review (UR) procedures, but placing the responsibility to follow such procedures on the physician or hospital, not the beneficiaries,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) selecting the most efficient physicians and state-of-the-art utilization management techniques, including ambulatory care techniques, for medical services delivered by the managed care network, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) utilizing a managed care network provider system, as practiced in the health care industry, at the time medical services are needed (point-of-service) in order to receive maximum benefits available under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Last signatory operators</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The board of trustees of the 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan shall permit any last signatory oper<!-- PDFPage:3820 -->ator required to maintain an individual employer plan under section 9711 to utilize the managed care and cost containment rules and programs developed under this subsection if the operator elects to do so.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Standards of quality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any managed care system or cost containment adopted by the board of trustees of the 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan or by a last signatory operator may not be implemented unless it is approved by, and meets the standards of quality adopted by, a medical peer review panel, which has been established&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by the settlors, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by the United Mine Workers of America and a last signatory operator or group of operators.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Standards of quality shall include accessibility to medical care, taking into account that accessibility requirements may differ depending on the nature of the medical need.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Guarantee of benefits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All 1988 last signatory operators shall be responsible for financing the benefits described in subsection (c) by meeting the following requirements in accordance with the contribution requirements established in the 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The payment of a monthly per beneficiary premium by each 1988 last signatory operator for each eligible beneficiary of such operator who is described in subsection (b)(2) and who is receiving benefits under the 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The provision of a security (in the form of a bond, letter of credit, or cash escrow) in an amount equal to a portion of the projected future cost to the 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan of providing health benefits for eligible and potentially eligible beneficiaries attributable to the 1988 last signatory operator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) If the amounts transferred under subsection (a)(3) are less than the amounts required to be transferred to the 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan under subsections (h) and (i) of section 402 of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1232), the payment of an additional backstop premium by each 1988 last signatory operator which is equal to such operator's share of the amounts required to be so transferred but which were not so transferred, determined on the basis of the number of eligible and potentially eligible beneficiaries attributable to the operator.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The 1992 UMWA Benefit Plan shall provide for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) annual adjustments of the per beneficiary premium to cover changes in the cost of providing benefits to eligible beneficiaries, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) adjustments as necessary to the annual backstop premium to reflect changes in the cost of providing benefits to eligible beneficiaries for whom per beneficiary premiums are not paid.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Additional liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any last signatory operator who is not a 1988 last signatory operator shall pay the monthly per beneficiary premium under paragraph (1)(A) for each eligible beneficiary described in such paragraph attributable to that operator.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Joint and several liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A 1988 last signatory operator or last signatory operator described in paragraph (3), and any related person to any such operator, shall be jointly and severally liable with such operator for any amount required to be paid by such operator under this section. The provisions of section 9711(c)(2) shall apply to any last signatory operator described in such section (without regard to whether security is provided under such section, a payment is made under section 9704(j), or both) and if security meeting the requirements of section 9711(c)(3) is provided, the common parent described in section 9711(c)(2)(B) shall be exclusively responsible for any liability for premiums under this section which, but for this sentence, would be required to be paid by the last signatory operator or any related person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Deductibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any premium required by this section shall be deductible without regard to any limitation on deductibility based on the prefunding of health benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) 1988 last signatory operator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;1988 last signatory operator&rdquo; means a last signatory operator which is a 1988 agreement operator.</p>
