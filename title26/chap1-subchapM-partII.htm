<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A corporation, trust, or association shall not be considered a real estate investment trust for any taxable year unless&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) gain from the sale or other disposition of a real estate asset which is not a prohibited transaction solely by reason of section 857(b)(6);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) at least 75 percent of its gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) is derived from&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) amounts (other than amounts the determination of which depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person) received or accrued as consideration for entering into agreements (i) to make loans secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property or (ii) to purchase or lease real property (including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) gain from the sale or other disposition of a real estate asset which is not a prohibited transaction solely by reason of section 857(b)(6); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) qualified temporary investment income;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) less than 30 percent of its gross income is derived from the sale or other disposition of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) stock or securities held for less than 1 year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) property in a transaction which is a prohibited transaction; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) property compulsorily or involuntarily converted within the meaning of section 1033, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) property which is foreclosure property within the definition of section 856(e); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) at the close of each quarter of the taxable year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) at least 75 percent of the value of its total assets is represented by real estate assets, cash and cash items (including receivables), and Government securities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not more than 25 percent of the value of its total assets is represented by securities (other than those includible under subparagraph (A)) for purposes of this calculation limited in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater in value than 5 percent of the value of the total assets of the trust and to not more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A real estate investment trust which meets the requirements of this paragraph at the close of any quarter shall not lose its status as <!-- PDFPage:1261 -->a real estate investment trust because of a discrepancy during a subsequent quarter between the value of its various investments and such requirements unless such discrepancy exists immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property and is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition. A real estate investment trust which does not meet such requirements at the close of any quarter by reason of a discrepancy existing immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property which is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition during such quarter shall not lose its status for such quarter as a real estate investment trust if such discrepancy is eliminated within 30 days after the close of such quarter and in such cases it shall be considered to have met such requirements at the close of such quarter for purposes of applying the preceding sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) For purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The term &ldquo;value&rdquo; means, with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such securities; and with respect to other securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith by the trustees, except that in the case of securities of real estate investment trusts such fair value shall not exceed market value or asset value, whichever is higher.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The term &ldquo;real estate assets&rdquo; means real property (including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property) and shares (or transferable certificates of beneficial interest) in other real estate investment trusts which meet the requirements of this part. Such term also includes any property (not otherwise a real estate asset) attributable to the temporary investment of new capital, but only if such property is stock or a debt instrument, and only for the 1-year period beginning on the date the real estate trust receives such capital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The term &ldquo;interests in real property&rdquo; includes fee ownership and co-ownership of land or improvements thereon, leaseholds of land or improvements thereon, options to acquire land or improvements thereon, and options to acquire leaseholds of land or improvements thereon, but does not include mineral, oil, or gas royalty interests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Qualified temporary investment income.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;qualified temporary investment income&rdquo; means any income which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is attributable to stock or a debt instrument (within the meaning of section 1275(a)(1)),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) is attributable to the temporary investment of new capital, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) is received or accrued during the 1-year period beginning on the date on which the real estate investment trust receives such capital.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>New capital</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;new capital&rdquo; means any amount received by the real estate investment trust&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) in exchange for stock (or certificates of beneficial interests) in such trust (other than amounts received pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) in a public offering of debt obligations of such trust which have maturities of at least 5 years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) A regular or residual interest in a REMIC shall be treated as a real estate asset, and any amount includible in gross income with respect to such an interest shall be treated as interest on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property; except that, if less than 95 percent of the assets of such REMIC are real estate assets (determined as if the real estate investment trust held such assets), such real estate investment trust shall be treated as holding directly (and as receiving directly) its proportionate share of the assets and income of the REMIC. For purposes of determining whether any interest in a REMIC qualifies under the preceding sentence, any interest held by such REMIC in another REMIC shall be treated as a real estate asset under principles similar to the principles of the preceding sentence, except that, if such REMIC's are part of a tiered structure, they shall be treated as one REMIC for purposes of this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) All other terms shall have the same meaning as when used in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;1 and following).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) <cap-smallcap>Treatment of certain interest rate agreements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except to the extent provided by regulations, any&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) payment to a real estate investment trust under a bona fide interest rate swap or cap agreement entered into by the real estate investment trust to hedge any variable rate indebtedness of such trust incurred or to be incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any gain from the sale or other disposition of such agreement,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">shall be treated as income qualifying under paragraph (2) and such agreement shall be treated as a security for purposes of paragraph (4)(A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) A corporation, trust, or association which fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3), or of both such paragraphs, for any taxable year shall nevertheless be considered to have satisfied the requirements of such paragraphs for such taxable year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the nature and amount of each item of its gross income described in such paragraphs is set forth in a schedule attached to its income tax return for such taxable year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the inclusion of any incorrect information in the schedule referred to in subparagraph (A) is not due to fraud with intent to evade tax; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the failure to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3), or of both such paragraphs, is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) <cap-smallcap>Treatment of liquidating gains</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of the taxable year in which a real estate <!-- PDFPage:1262 -->investment trust is completely liquidated, there shall not be taken into account under paragraph (4) any gain from the sale, exchange, or distribution of any property after the adoption of the plan of complete liquidation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rents from real property defined</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amounts included</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (c), the term &ldquo;rents from real property&rdquo; includes (subject to paragraph (2))&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) charges for services customarily furnished or rendered in connection with the rental of real property, whether or not such charges are separately stated, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) rent attributable to personal property which is leased under, or in connection with, a lease of real property, but only if the rent attributable to such personal property for the taxable year does not exceed 15 percent of the total rent for the taxable year attributable to both the real and personal property leased under, or in connection with, such lease.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (C), with respect to each lease of real property, rent attributable to personal property for the taxable year is that amount which bears the same ratio to total rent for the taxable year as the average of the adjusted bases of the personal property at the beginning and at the end of the taxable year bears to the average of the aggregate adjusted bases of both the real property and the personal property at the beginning and at the end of such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amounts excluded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (c), the term &ldquo;rents from real property&rdquo; does not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) except as provided in paragraphs (4) and (6), any amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, with respect to any real or personal property, if the determination of such amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits derived by any person from such property (except that any amount so received or accrued shall not be excluded from the term &ldquo;rents from real property&rdquo; solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any amount received or accrued directly or indirectly from any person if the real estate investment trust owns, directly or indirectly&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of any person which is a corporation, stock of such person possessing 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or 10 percent or more of the total number of shares of all classes of stock of such person; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of any person which is not a corporation, an interest of 10 percent or more in the assets or net profits of such person; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, with respect to any real or personal property if the real estate investment trust furnishes or renders services to the tenants of such property, or manages or operates such property, other than through an independent contractor from whom the trust itself does not derive or receive any income.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Subparagraph (C) shall not apply with respect to any amount if such amount would be excluded from unrelated business taxable income under section 512(b)(3) if received by an organization described in section 511(a)(2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Independent contractor defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection and subsection (e), the term &ldquo;independent contractor&rdquo; means any person&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if such person is a corporation, not more than 35 percent of the total combined voting power of whose stock (or 35 percent of the total shares of all classes of whose stock), or, if such person is not a corporation, not more than 35 percent of the interest in whose assets or net profits is owned, directly or indirectly, by one or more persons owning 35 percent or more of the shares or certificates of beneficial interest in the trust.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule for certain contingent rents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where a real estate investment trust receives or accrues, with respect to real or personal property, any amount which would be excluded from the term &ldquo;rents from real property&rdquo; solely because the tenant of the real estate investment trust receives or accrues, directly or indirectly, from subtenants any amount the determination of which depends in whole or in part on the income or profits derived by any person from such property, only a proportionate part (determined pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary) of the amount received or accrued by the real estate investment trust from that tenant will be excluded from the term &ldquo;rents from real property&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Constructive ownership of stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the rules prescribed by section 318(a) for determining the ownership of stock shall apply in determining the ownership of stock, assets, or net profits of any person; except that &ldquo;10 percent&rdquo; shall be substituted for &ldquo;50 percent&rdquo; in subparagraph (C) of section 318(a)(2) and 318(a)(3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Special rule for certain property subleased by tenant of real estate investment trusts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a real estate investment trust receives or accrues, with respect to real or personal property, amounts from a tenant which derives substantially all of its income with respect to such property from the subleasing of substantially all of such property, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a portion of the amount such tenant receives or accrues, directly or indirectly, <!-- PDFPage:1263 -->from subtenants consists of qualified rents,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then the amounts which the trust receives or accrues from the tenant shall not be excluded from the term &ldquo;rents from real property&rdquo; by reason of being based on the income or profits of such tenant to the extent the amounts so received or accrued are attributable to qualified rents received or accrued by such tenant.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Qualified rents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;qualified rents&rdquo; means any amount which would be treated as rents from real property if received by the real estate investment trust.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special rules for foreclosure property</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Foreclosure property defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;foreclosure property&rdquo; means any real property (including interests in real property), and any personal property incident to such real property, acquired by the real estate investment trust as the result of such trust having bid in such property at foreclosure, or having otherwise reduced such property to ownership or possession by agreement or process of law, after there was default (or default was imminent) on a lease of such property or on an indebtedness which such property secured. Such term does not include property acquired by the real estate investment trust as a result of indebtedness arising from the sale or other disposition of property of the trust described in section 1221(1) which was not originally acquired as foreclosure property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Grace period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (3), property shall cease to be foreclosure property with respect to the real estate investment trust on the date which is 2 years after the date such trust acquired such property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Extensions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the real estate investment trust establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that an extension of the grace period is necessary for the orderly liquidation of the trust's interests in such property, the Secretary may grant one or more extensions of the grace period for such property. Any such extension shall not extend the grace period beyond the date which is 6 years after the date such trust acquired such property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Termination of grace period in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any foreclosure property shall cease to be such on the first day (occurring on or after the day on which the real estate investment trust acquired the property) on which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a lease is entered into with respect to such property which, by its terms, will give rise to income which is not described in subsection (c)(3) (other than subparagraph (F) of such subsection), or any amount is received or accrued, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a lease entered into on or after such day which is not described in such subsection,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any construction takes place on such property (other than completion of a building, or completion of any other improvement, where more than 10 percent of the construction of such building or other improvement was completed before default became imminent), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if such day is more than 90 days after the day on which such property was acquired by the real estate investment trust and the property is used in a trade or business which is conducted by the trust (other than through an independent contractor (within the meaning of section (d)(3)) from whom the trust itself does not derive or receive any income).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Taxpayer must make election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Property shall be treated as foreclosure property for purposes of this part only if the real estate investment trust so elects (in the manner provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary) on or before the due date (including any extensions of time) for filing its return of tax under this chapter for the taxable year in which such trust acquires such property. Any such election shall be irrevocable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraphs (2)(B) and (3)(B) of subsection (c), the term &ldquo;interest&rdquo; does not include any amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, if the determination of such amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any amount so received or accrued shall not be excluded from the term &ldquo;interest&rdquo; solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) where a real estate investment trust receives any amount which would be excluded from the term &ldquo;interest&rdquo; solely because the debtor of the real estate investment trust receives or accrues any amount the determination of which depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person, only a proportionate part (determined pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary) of the amount received or accrued by the real estate investment trust from the debtor will be excluded from the term &ldquo;interest&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a real estate investment trust receives or accrues with respect to an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property or an interest in real property amounts from a debtor which derives substantially all of its gross income with respect to such property (not taking into account any gain on any disposition) from the leasing of substantially all of its interests in such property to tenants, and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirements applicable to real estate investment trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this part (other than subsection (d) of this section and subsection (g) of section 856) shall not apply to a real estate investment trust for a taxable year unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the deduction for dividends paid during the taxable year (as defined in section 561, but determined without regard to capital gains dividends) equals or exceeds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 95 percent (90 percent for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1980) of the real estate investment trust taxable <!-- PDFPage:1269 -->income for the taxable year (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) and by excluding any net capital gain); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 95 percent (90 percent for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1980) of the excess of the net income from foreclosure property over the tax imposed on such income by subsection (b)(4)(A); minus</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any excess noncash income (as determined under subsection (e)); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the real estate investment trust complies for such year with regulations prescribed by the Secretary for the purpose of ascertaining the actual ownership of the outstanding shares, or certificates of beneficial interest, of such trust, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the provisions of this part apply to the real estate investment trust for all taxable years beginning after February 28, 1986, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as of the close of the taxable year, the real estate investment trust has no earnings and profits accumulated in any non-REIT year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;non-REIT year&rdquo; means any taxable year to which the provisions of this part did not apply with respect to the entity. The Secretary may waive the requirements of paragraph (1) for any taxable year if the real estate investment trust establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it was unable to meet such requirements by reason of distributions previously made to meet the requirements of section 4981.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of taxation of real estate investment trusts and holders of shares or certificates of beneficial interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Imposition of tax on real estate investment trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the real estate investment trust taxable income of every real estate investment trust a tax computed as provided in section 11, as though the real estate investment trust taxable income were the taxable income referred to in section 11.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Real estate investment trust taxable income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;real estate investment trust taxable income&rdquo; means the taxable income of the real estate investment trust, adjusted as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The deductions for corporations provided in part VIII (except section 248) of subchapter B (section 241 and following, relating to the deduction for dividends received, etc.) shall not be allowed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) shall be allowed, but shall be computed without regard to that portion of such deduction which is attributable to the amount excluded under subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The taxable income shall be computed without regard to section 443(b) (relating to computation of tax on change of annual accounting period).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) There shall be excluded an amount equal to the net income from foreclosure property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) There shall be deducted an amount equal to the tax imposed by paragraph (5) for the taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) There shall be excluded an amount equal to any net income derived from prohibited transactions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Capital gains</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Alternative tax in case of capital gains</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If for any taxable year a real estate investment trust has a net capital gain, then, in lieu of the tax imposed by subsection (b)(1), there is hereby imposed a tax (if such tax is less than the tax imposed by such subsection) which shall consist of the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a tax, computed as provided in subsection (b)(1), on the real estate investment trust taxable income (determined by excluding such net capital gain and by computing the deduction for dividends paid without regard to capital gain dividends), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a tax determined at the rate provided in section 1201(a) on the excess of the net capital gain over the deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) determined with reference to capital gains dividends only.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of capital gain dividends by shareholders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A capital gain dividend shall be treated by the shareholders or holders of beneficial interests as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 1 year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Definition of capital gain dividend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this part, a capital gain dividend is any dividend, or part thereof, which is designated by the real estate investment trust as a capital gain dividend in a written notice mailed to its shareholders or holders of beneficial interests at any time before the expiration of 30 days after the close of its taxable year (or mailed to its shareholders or holders of beneficial interests with its annual report for the taxable year); except that, if there is an increase in the excess described in subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph for such year which results from a determination (as defined in section 860(e)), such designation may be made with respect to such increase at any time before the expiration of 120 days after the date of such determination. If the aggregate amount so designated with respect to a taxable year of the trust (including capital gain dividends paid after the close of the taxable year described in section 858) is greater than the net capital gain of the taxable year, the portion of each distribution which shall be a capital gain dividend shall be only that proportion of the amount so designated which such net capital gain bears to the aggregate amount so designated. For purposes of this subparagraph, the amount of the net capital gain for any taxable year which is not a calendar year shall be determined without regard to any net capital loss attributable to transactions after December 31 of such year, and any such net capital loss shall be treated as arising on the 1st day of the next taxable <!-- PDFPage:1270 -->year. To the extent provided in regulations, the preceding sentence shall apply also for purposes of computing the taxable income of the real estate investment trust.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Coordination with net operating loss provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of section 172, if a real estate investment trust pays capital gain dividends during any taxable year, the amount of the net capital gain for such taxable year (to the extent such gain does not exceed the amount of such capital gain dividends) shall be excluded in determining&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the net operating loss for the taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of the net operating loss of any prior taxable year which may be carried through such taxable year under section 172(b)(2) to a succeeding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Income from foreclosure property</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Imposition of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A tax is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the net income from foreclosure property of every real estate investment trust. Such tax shall be computed by multiplying the net income from foreclosure property by the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Net income from foreclosure property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;net income from foreclosure property&rdquo; means the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) gain from the sale or other disposition of foreclosure property described in section 1221(1) and the gross income for the taxable year derived from foreclosure property (as defined in section 856(e)), but only to the extent such gross income is not described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), or (G) of section 856(c)(3), over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the production of the income referred to in clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Imposition of tax in case of failure to meet certain requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If section 856(c)(7) applies to a real estate investment trust for any taxable year, there is hereby imposed on such trust a tax in an amount equal to the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 95 percent (90 percent in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 1980) of the gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) of the real estate investment trust, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of such gross income which is derived from sources referred to in section 856(c)(2); or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 75 percent of the gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) of the real estate investment trust, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of such gross income which is derived from sources referred to in section 856(c)(3),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the real estate investment trust taxable income for the taxable year (determined without regard to the deductions provided in paragraphs (2)(B) and (2)(E), without regard to any net operating loss deduction, and by excluding any net capital gain) and the denominator of which is the gross income for the taxable year (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions; gross income and gain from foreclosure property (as defined in section 856(e), but only to the extent such gross income and gain is not described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), or (G) of section 856(c)(3)); long-term capital gain; and short-term capital gain to the extent of any short-term capital loss).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Income from prohibited transactions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Imposition of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">There is hereby imposed for each taxable year of every real estate investment trust a tax equal to 100 percent of the net income derived from prohibited transactions.</p>
