<p class="statutory-body-block">To the extent not inconsistent with the preceding sentence or any other provision of this part, all such computations shall be made in a manner consistent with the manner required for purposes of the annual statement approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amortization of premium and accrual of discount</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The appropriate items of income, deductions, and adjustments under this part shall be adjusted to reflect the appropriate amortization of premium and the appropriate accrual of discount attributable to the taxable year on bonds, notes, debentures, or other evidences of indebtedness held by a life insurance company.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any item to be deducted (either directly or as an increase in reserves) more than once.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is guaranteed beyond the end of the taxable year on which the reserves are being computed,</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Exclusion of items</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a domestic mutual insurance company which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is a life insurance company,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has a contiguous country life insurance branch, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) makes the election provided by subsection (g) with respect to such branch,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">there shall be excluded from each item involved in the determination of life insurance company taxable income the items separately accounted for in accordance with subsection (c).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Contiguous country life insurance branch</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term contiguous country life insurance branch means a branch which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) issues insurance contracts insuring risks in connection with the lives or health of residents of a country which is contiguous to the United States,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has its principal place of business in such contiguous country, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) would constitute a mutual life insurance company if such branch were a separate domestic insurance company.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;insurance contract&rdquo; means any life, health, accident, or annuity contract or reinsurance contract or any contract relating thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Separate accounting required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any taxpayer which makes the election provided by subsection (g) shall establish and maintain a separate account for the various income, exclusion, deduction, asset, reserve, liability, and surplus items properly attributable to the contracts described in subsection (b). Such separate accounting shall be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in accordance with the method regularly employed by such company, if such method clearly reflects income derived from, and the other items attributable to, the contracts described in subsection (b), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in all other cases, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Recognition of gain on assets in branch account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the aggregate fair market value of all the invested assets and tangible property which are separately accounted for by the domestic life insurance company in the branch account established pursuant to subsection (c) exceeds the aggregate adjusted basis of such assets for purposes of determining gain, then the domestic life insurance company shall be treated as having sold all such assets on the first day of the first <!-- PDFPage:1698 -->taxable year for which the election is in effect at their fair market value on such first day. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the net gain shall be recognized to the domestic life insurance company on the deemed sale described in the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Transactions between contiguous country branch and domestic life insurance company</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Reimbursement for home office services, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any payment, transfer, reimbursement, credit, or allowance which is made from a separate account established pursuant to subsection (c) to one or more other accounts of a domestic life insurance company as reimbursement for costs incurred for or with respect to the insurance (or reinsurance) of risks accounted for in such separate account shall be taken into account by the domestic life insurance company in the same manner as if such payment, transfer, reimbursement, credit, or allowance had been received from a separate person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Repatriation of income</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), any amount directly or indirectly transferred or credited from a branch account established pursuant to subsection (c) to one or more other accounts of such company shall, unless such transfer or credit is a reimbursement to which paragraph (1) applies, be added to the income of the domestic life insurance company.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The addition provided by subparagraph (A) for the taxable year with respect to any contiguous country life insurance branch shall not exceed the amount by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the aggregate decrease in the tentative LICTI of the domestic life insurance company for the taxable year and for all prior taxable years resulting solely from the application of subsection (a) of this section with respect to such branch, exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of additions to tentative LICTI pursuant to subparagraph (A) with respect to such contiguous country branch for all prior taxable years.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Transitional rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of a prior taxable year beginning before January 1, 1984, the term &ldquo;tentative LICTI&rdquo; means life insurance company taxable income determined under this part (as in effect for such year) without regard to this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Other rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Treatment of foreign taxes</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No income, war profits, or excess profits taxes paid or accrued to any foreign country or possession of the United States which is attributable to income excluded under subsection (a) shall be taken into account for purposes of subpart A of part III of subchapter N (relating to foreign tax credit) or allowable as a deduction.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of repatriated amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of sections 78 and 902, where any amount is added to the life insurance company taxable income of the domestic life insurance company by reason of subsection (e)(2), the contiguous country life insurance branch shall be treated as a foreign corporation. Any amount so added shall be treated as a dividend paid by a foreign corporation, and the taxes paid to any foreign country or possession of the United States with respect to such amount shall be deemed to have been paid by such branch.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) United States source income allocable to contiguous country branch</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of sections 881, 882, and 1442, each contiguous country life insurance branch shall be treated as a foreign corporation. Such sections shall be applied to each such branch in the same manner as if such sections contained the provisions of any treaty to which the United States and the contiguous country are parties, to the same extent such provisions would apply if such branch were incorporated in such contiguous country.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A taxpayer may make the election provided by this subsection with respect to any contiguous country for any taxable year. An election made under this subsection for any taxable year shall remain in effect for all subsequent taxable years, except that it may be revoked with the consent of the Secretary. The election provided by this subsection shall be made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return for the taxable year (including extensions thereof) with respect to which such election is made, and such election and any approved revocation thereof shall be made in the manner provided by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Special rule for domestic stock life insurance companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the election of a domestic stock life insurance company which has a contiguous country life insurance branch described in subsection (b) (without regard to the mutual requirement in subsection (b)(3)), the assets of such branch may be transferred to a foreign corporation organized under the laws of the contiguous country without the application of section 367. Subsection (a) shall apply to the stock of such foreign corporation as if such domestic company were a mutual company and as if the stock were an item described in subsection (c). Subsection (e)(2) shall apply to amounts transferred or credited to such domestic company as if such domestic company and such foreign corporation constituted one domestic mutual life insurance company. The insurance contracts which may be transferred pursuant to this subsection shall include only those which are similar to the types of insurance contracts issued by a mutual life insurance company. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this subsection, if the aggregate fair market value of the invested assets and tangible property which <!-- PDFPage:1699 -->are separately accounted for by the domestic life insurance company in the branch account exceeds the aggregate adjusted basis of such assets for purposes of determining gain, the domestic life insurance company shall be deemed to have sold all such assets on the first day of the taxable year for which the election under this subsection applies and the net gain shall be recognized to the domestic life insurance company on the deemed sale, but not in excess of the proportion of such net gain which equals the proportion which the aggregate fair market value of such assets which are transferred pursuant to this subsection is of the aggregate fair market value of all such assets.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Increases and decreases in reserves</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsections (a) and (b) of section 807, the sum of the items described in section 807(c) taken into account as of the close of the taxable year with respect to any variable contract shall, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, be adjusted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by subtracting therefrom an amount equal to the sum of the amounts added from time to time (for the taxable year) to the reserves separately accounted for in accordance with subsection (c) by reason of appreciation in value of assets (whether or not the assets have been disposed of), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by adding thereto an amount equal to the sum of the amounts subtracted from time to time (for the taxable year) from such reserves by reason of depreciation in value of assets (whether or not the assets have been disposed of).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The deduction allowable for items described in paragraphs (1) and (6) of section 805(a) with respect to variable contracts shall be reduced to the extent that the amount of such items is increased for the taxable year by appreciation (or increased to the extent that the amount of such items is decreased for the taxable year by depreciation) not reflected in adjustments under the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustment to basis of assets held in segregated asset account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of variable contracts, the basis of each asset in a segregated asset account shall (in addition to all other adjustments to basis) be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) increased by the amount of any appreciation in value, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) decreased by the amount of any depreciation in value,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1703 --><p class="statutory-body-block">to the extent such appreciation and depreciation are from time to time reflected in the increases and decreases in reserves or other items referred to in subsection (a) with respect to such contracts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Separate accounting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, a life insurance company which issues variable contracts shall separately account for the various income, exclusion, deduction, asset, reserve, and other liability items properly attributable to such variable contracts. For such items as are not accounted for directly, separate accounting shall be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in accordance with the method regularly employed by such company, if such method is reasonable, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in all other cases, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Variable contract defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;variable contract&rdquo; means a contract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) which provides for the allocation of all or part of the amounts received under the contract to an account which, pursuant to State law or regulation, is segregated from the general asset accounts of the company,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provides for the payment of annuities,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is a life insurance contract, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provides for funding of insurance on retired lives as described in section 807(c)(6), and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) under which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of an annuity contract, the amounts paid in, or the amount paid out, reflect the investment return and the market value of the segregated asset account,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a life insurance contract, the amount of the death benefit (or the period of coverage) is adjusted on the basis of the investment return and the market value of the segregated asset account, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of funds held under a contract described in paragraph (2)(C), the amounts paid in, or the amounts paid out, reflect the investment return and the market value of the segregated asset account.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If a contract ceases to reflect current investment return and current market value, such contract shall not be considered as meeting the requirements of paragraph (3) after such cessation. Paragraph (3) shall be applied without regard to whether there is a guarantee, and obligations under such guarantee which exceed obligations under the contract without regard to such guarantee shall be accounted for as part of the company's general account.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Pension plan contracts treated as paying annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A pension plan contract which is not a life, accident, or health, property, casualty, or liability insurance contract shall be treated as a contract which provides for the payments of annuities for purposes of subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Other special rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Life insurance reserves</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(A) of section 816, the reflection of the investment return and the market value of the segregated asset account shall be considered an assumed rate of interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional separate computations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, such additional separate computations shall be made, with respect to the items separately accounted for in accordance with subsection (c), as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this section and this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Variable annuity contracts treated as annuity contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;annuity contract&rdquo; includes a contract which provides for the payment of a variable annuity computed on the basis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) recognized mortality tables, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) the investment experience of a segregated asset account, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the company-wide investment experience of the company.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Paragraph (2)(B) shall not apply to any company which issues contracts which are not variable contracts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Treatment of certain nondiversified contracts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subchapter L, section 72 (relating to annuities), and section 7702(a) (relating to definition of life insurance contract), a variable contract (other than a pension plan contract) which is otherwise described in this section and which is based on a segregated asset account shall not be treated as an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract for any period (and any subsequent period) for which the investments made by such account are not, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, adequately diversified.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Safe harbor for diversification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A segregated asset account shall be treated as meeting the requirements of paragraph (1) for any quarter of a taxable year if as of the close of such quarter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) it meets the requirements of section 851(b)(3), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) no more than 55 percent of the value of the total assets of the account are assets described in section 851(b)(3)(A)(i).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule for investments in United States obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent that any segregated asset account with respect to a variable life insurance contract is invested in securities issued by the United States Treasury, the investments made by such account shall be treated as adequately diversified for purposes of paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Look-through in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, if all of the beneficial interests in a regulated investment company or in a trust are held by 1 or more&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) insurance companies (or affiliated companies) in their general account or in segregated asset accounts, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) fund managers (or affiliated companies) in connection with the creation or <!-- PDFPage:1704 -->management of the regulated investment company or trust,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the diversification requirements of paragraph (1) shall be applied by taking into account the assets held by such regulated investment company or trust.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Independent investment advisors permitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting the use of independent investment advisors.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Government securities funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining whether a segregated asset account is adequately diversified for purposes of paragraph (1), each United States Government agency or instrumentality shall be treated as a separate issuer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) under which the unabsorbed portion of such premium deposits not required for losses, expenses, or establishment of reserves is returned or credited to the policyholder on cancellation or expiration of the policy,</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;847. Special estimated tax payments</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of taxable years beginning after December 31, 1987, of an insurance company required to discount unpaid losses (as defined in section 846)&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Additional deduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There shall be allowed as a deduction for the taxable year, if special estimated tax payments are made as required by paragraph (2), an amount not to exceed the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of the undiscounted, unpaid losses (as defined in section 846(b)) attributable to losses incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of the related discounted, unpaid losses determined under section 846,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">to the extent such amount was not deducted under this paragraph in a preceding taxable <!-- PDFPage:1734 -->year. Section 6655 shall be applied to any taxable year without regard to the deduction allowed under the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special estimated tax payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The deduction under paragraph (1) shall be allowed only to the extent that such deduction would result in a tax benefit for the taxable year for which such deduction is allowed or any carryback year and only to the extent that special estimated tax payments are made in an amount equal to the tax benefit attributable to such deduction on or before the due date (determined without regard to extensions) for filing the return for the taxable year for which the deduction is allowed. If a deduction would be allowed but for the fact that special estimated tax payments were not timely made, such deduction shall be allowed to the extent such payments are made within a reasonable time, as determined by the Secretary, if all interest and penalties, computed as if this sentence did not apply, are paid. If amounts are included in gross income under paragraph (5) or (6) for any taxable year and an additional tax is due for such year (or any other year) as a result of such inclusion, an amount of special estimated tax payments equal to such additional tax shall be applied against such additional tax. If, after any such payment is so applied, there is an adjustment reducing the amount of such additional tax, in lieu of any credit or refund for such reduction, a special estimated tax payment shall be treated as made in an amount equal to the amount otherwise allowable as a credit or refund. To the extent that a special estimated tax payment is not used to offset additional tax due for any of the first 15 taxable years beginning after the year for which the payment was made, such special estimated tax payment shall be treated as an estimated tax payment made under section 6655 for the 16th year after the year for which the payment was made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special loss discount account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each company which is allowed a deduction under paragraph (1) shall, for purposes of this part, establish and maintain a special loss discount account.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Additions to special loss discount account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There shall be added to the special loss discount account for each taxable year an amount equal to the amount allowed as a deduction for the taxable year under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Subtractions from special loss discount account and inclusion in gross income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After applying paragraph (4), there shall be subtracted for the taxable year from the special loss discount account and included in gross income:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The excess (if any) of the amount in the special loss discount account with respect to losses incurred in each taxable year over the amount of the excess referred to in paragraph (1) with respect to losses incurred in that year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Any amount improperly subtracted from the special loss discount account under subparagraph (A) to the extent special estimated tax payments were used with respect to such amount.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">To the extent that any amount added to the special loss discount account is not subtracted from such account before the 15th year after the year for which the amount was so added, such amount shall be subtracted from such account for such 15th year and included in gross income for such 15th year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Rules in the case of liquidation or termination of taxpayer's insurance business</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a company liquidates or otherwise terminates its insurance business and does not transfer or distribute such business in an acquisition of assets referred to in section 381(a), the entire amount remaining in such special loss discount account shall be subtracted and included in gross income. Except in the case where a company transfers or distributes its insurance business in an acquisition of assets, referred to in section 381(a), if the company is not subject to the tax imposed by section 801 or section 831 for any taxable year, the entire amount in the account at the close of the preceding taxable year shall be subtracted from the account in such preceding taxable year and included in gross income.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Elimination of balance of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case to which subparagraph (A) applies, any special estimated tax payment remaining after the credit attributable to the inclusion under subparagraph (A) shall be voided.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Modification of the amount of special estimated tax payments in the event of subsequent marginal rate reduction or increase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the event of a reduction in any tax rate provided under section 11 for any tax year after the enactment of this section, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations providing for a reduction in the amount of any special estimated tax payments made for years before the effective date of such section 11 rate reductions. Such reduction in the amount of such payments shall reduce the amount of such payments to the amount that they would have been if the special deduction permitted under paragraph (1) had occurred during a year that the lower marginal rate under section 11 applied. Similar rules shall be applied in the event of a marginal rate increase.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Tax benefit determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The tax benefit attributable to the deduction under paragraph (1) shall be determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by taking into account tax benefits that would arise from the carryback of any net operating loss for the year, as well as current year tax benefits. Tax benefits for the current year and carryback years shall include those that would arise from the filing of a consolidated return with another insurance company required to determine discounted, unpaid losses under section 846 without regard to the limitations on consolidation contained in section <!-- PDFPage:1735 -->1503(c). The limitations on consolidation contained in section 1503(c) shall not apply to the deduction allowed under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Effect on earnings and profits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the earnings and profits&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any special estimated tax payment made for any taxable year shall be treated as a payment of income tax imposed by this title for such taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any deduction or inclusion under this section shall not be taken into account.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed to affect the application of section 56(g) (relating to adjustments based on adjusted current earnings).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section, including regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) providing for the separate application of this section with respect to each accident year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such adjustments in the application of this section as may be necessary to take into account the tax imposed by section 55, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) providing for the application of this section in cases where the deduction allowed under paragraph (1) for any taxable year is less than the excess referred to in paragraph (1) for such year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;negative capitalization amount&rdquo; means, with respect to any category of specified insurance contracts, the percentage (applicable under subsection (c)(1) to such category) of the amount (if any) by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount determined under subparagraph (B) of subsection (d)(1) with respect to such category, exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount determined under subparagraph (A) of subsection (d)(1) with respect to such category.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Treatment of certain ceding commissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in any provision of law (other than this section or section 197) shall require the capitalization of any ceding commission incurred on or after September 30, 1990, under any contract which reinsures a specified insurance contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Secretarial authority to adjust capitalization amounts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary may provide that a type of insurance contract will be treated as a separate category for purposes of this section (and prescribe a percentage applicable to such category) if the Secretary determines that the deferral of acquisition expenses for such type of contract which would otherwise result under this section is substantially greater than the deferral of acquisition expenses which would have resulted if actual acquisition expenses (including indirect expenses) and the actual useful life for such type of contract had been used.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustment to other contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary exercises his authority with respect to any type of contract under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall adjust the percentage which would otherwise have applied under subsection (c)(1) to the category which includes such type of contract so that the exercise of such authority does not result in a decrease in the amount of revenue received under this chapter by reason of this section for any fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Treatment of qualified foreign contracts under adjusted current earnings preference</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining adjusted current earnings under section 56(g), acquisition expenses with respect to contracts described in clause (iii) of subsection (e)(1)(B) shall be capitalized and amortized in accordance with the treatment generally required under generally accepted accounting principles as if this subsection applied to such contracts for all taxable years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Transitional rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any taxable year which includes September 30, 1990, the amount taken into account as the net premiums (or negative capitalization amount) with respect to any category of specified insurance contracts shall be the amount which bears the same ratio to the amount which (but for this subsection) would be so taken into account as the number of days in such taxable year on or after September 30, 1990, bears to the total number of days in such taxable year.</p>
