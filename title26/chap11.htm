<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a tax on a gift has been paid under chapter 12 (sec. 2501 and following), or under corresponding provisions of prior laws, and thereafter on the death of the donor any amount in respect of such gift is required to be included in the value of the gross estate of the decedent for purposes of this chapter, then there shall be credited against the tax imposed by section 2001 the amount of the tax paid on a gift under chapter 12, or under corresponding provisions of prior laws, with respect to so much of the property which constituted the gift as is included in the gross estate, except that the amount of such credit shall not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to the tax imposed by section 2001 (after deducting from such tax the credit for State death taxes provided by section 2011 and the unified credit provided by section 2010) as the value (at the time of the gift or at the time of the death, whichever is lower) of so much of the property which constituted the gift as is included in the gross estate bears to the value of the entire gross estate reduced by the aggregate amount of the charitable and marital deductions allowed under sections 2055, 2056, and 2106(a)(2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Valuation reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In applying, with respect to any gift, the ratio stated in subsection (a), the value at the time of the gift or at the time of the death, referred to in such ratio, shall be reduced&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by such amount as will properly reflect the amount of such gift which was excluded in determining (for purposes of section 2503(a)), or of corresponding provisions of prior laws, the total amount of gifts made during the calendar quarter (or calendar year if the gift was made before January 1, 1971) in which the gift was made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if a deduction with respect to such gift is allowed under section 2056(a) (relating to marital deduction), then by the amount of such value, reduced as provided in paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if a deduction with respect to such gift is allowed under sections 2055 or 2106(a)(2) (relating to charitable deduction), then by the amount of such value, reduced as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Where gift considered made one-half by spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where the decedent was the donor of the gift but, under the provisions of section 2513, or corresponding provisions of prior laws, the gift was considered as made one-half by his spouse&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;the amount of the tax paid on a gift under chapter 12&rdquo;, as used in subsection (a), includes the amounts paid with respect to each half of such gift, the amount paid with respect to each being computed in the manner provided in subsection (d); and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Computation of amount of gift tax paid</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amount of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (a), the amount of tax paid on a gift under chapter 12, or under corresponding provisions of prior laws, with respect to any gift shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the total tax paid for the calendar quarter (or calendar year if the gift was made before January 1, 1971) in which the gift was made as the amount of such gift bears to the total amount of taxable gifts (computed without deduction of the specific exemption) for such quarter or year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of gift</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the &ldquo;amount of such gift&rdquo; shall be the amount included with respect to such gift in determining (for the purposes of section 2503(a), or of corresponding provisions of prior laws) the total amount of gifts made during such quarter or year, reduced by the amount of any deduction allowed with respect to such gift under section 2522, or under corresponding provisions of prior laws (relating to charitable deduction), or under section 2523 (relating to marital deduction).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Section inapplicable to gifts made after December 31, 1976</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The tax imposed by section 2001 shall be credited with all or a part of the amount of the Federal estate tax paid with respect to the transfer of property (including property passing as a result of the exercise or non-exercise of a power of appointment) to the decedent by or from a person (herein designated as a &ldquo;transferor&rdquo;) who died within 10 years before, or within 2 years after, the decedent's death. If the transferor died within 2 years of the death of the decedent, the credit shall be the amount determined under subsections (b) and (c). If the transferor predeceased the decedent by more than 2 years, the credit shall be the following percentage of the amount so determined&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 80 percent, if within the third or fourth years preceding the decedent's death;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 60 percent, if within the fifth or sixth years preceding the decedent's death;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) 40 percent, if within the seventh or eighth years preceding the decedent's death; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) 20 percent, if within the ninth or tenth years preceding the decedent's death.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation of credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the limitation prescribed in subsection (c), the credit provided by this section shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the estate tax paid (adjusted as indicated hereinafter) with respect to the estate of the transferor as the value of the property transferred bears to the taxable estate of the transferor (determined for purposes of the estate tax) decreased by any death taxes paid with respect to such estate. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the estate tax paid shall be the Federal estate tax paid increased by any credits allowed against such estate tax under section 2012, or corresponding provisions of prior laws, on account of gift tax, and for any credits allowed against such estate tax under this section on account of prior transfers where the transferor acquired property from a person who died within 10 years before the death of the decedent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation on credit</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The credit provided in this section shall not exceed the amount by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the estate tax imposed by section 2001 or section 2101 (after deducting the credits provided for in sections 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2014) computed without regard to this section, exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such tax computed by excluding from the decedent's gross estate the value of such property transferred and, if applicable, by making the adjustment hereinafter indicated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If any deduction is otherwise allowable under section 2055 or section 2106(a)(2) (relating to charitable deduction) then, for the purpose of the computation indicated in subparagraph (B), the amount of such deduction shall be reduced by that part of such deduction which the value of such property transferred bears to the decedent's entire gross estate reduced by the deductions allowed under sections 2053 and 2054, or section 2106(a)(1) (relating to deduction for expenses, losses, etc.). For purposes of this section, the value of such property transferred shall be the value as provided for in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Two or more transferors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the credit provided in this section relates to property received from 2 or more transferors, the limitation provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be computed by aggregating the value of the property so transferred to the decedent. The aggregate limitation so determined shall be apportioned in accordance with the value of the property transferred to the decedent by each transferor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Valuation of property transferred</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The value of property transferred to the decedent shall be the value used for the purpose of determining the Federal estate tax liability of the estate of the transferor but&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there shall be taken into account the effect of the tax imposed by section 2001 or 2101, or any estate, succession, legacy, or inheritance tax, on the net value to the decedent of such property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) where such property is encumbered in any manner, or where the decedent incurs any obligation imposed by the transferor with respect to such property, such encumbrance or obligation shall be taken into account in the same manner as if the amount of a gift to the decedent of such property was being determined; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if the decedent was the spouse of the transferor at the time of the transferor's death, the net value of the property transferred to the decedent shall be reduced by the amount allowed under section 2056 (relating to marital deductions), as a deduction from the gross estate of the transferor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Property defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;property&rdquo; includes any beneficial interest in prop<!-- PDFPage:1728 -->erty, including a general power of appointment (as defined in section 2041).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Treatment of additional tax imposed under section 2032A</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If section 2032A applies to any property included in the gross estate of the transferor and an additional tax is imposed with respect to such property under section 2032A(c) before the date which is 2 years after the date of the decedent's death, for purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the additional tax imposed by section 2032A(c) shall be treated as a Federal estate tax payable with respect to the estate of the transferor; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The tax imposed by section 2001 shall be credited with the amount of any estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes actually paid to any foreign country in respect of any property situated within such foreign country and included in the gross estate (not including any such taxes paid with respect to the estate of a person other than the decedent). The determination of the country within which property is situated shall be made in accordance with the rules applicable under subchapter B (sec. 2101 and following) in determining whether property is situated within or without the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) situated within such foreign country,</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the President finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a foreign country, in imposing estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes, does not allow to citizens of the United States resident in such foreign country at the time of death a credit similar to the credit allowed under subsection (a),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such foreign country, when requested by the United States to do so has not acted to provide such a similar credit in the case of citizens of the United States resident in such foreign country at the time of death, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) it is in the public interest to allow the credit under subsection (a) in the case of citizens or subjects of such foreign country only if it allows such a similar credit in the case of citizens of the United States resident in such foreign country at the time of death,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the President shall proclaim that, in the case of citizens or subjects of such foreign country dying while the proclamation remains in effect, the credit under subsection (a) shall be allowed only if such foreign country allows such a similar credit in the case of citizens of the United States resident in such foreign country at the time of death.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjusted tax difference attributable to interest</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The value of the gross estate shall include the value of all property to the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time after September 7, 1916, made a transfer (except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth), by trust or otherwise, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) possession or enjoyment of the property can, through ownership of such interest, be obtained only by surviving the decedent, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the decedent has retained a reversionary interest in the property (but in the case of a transfer made before October 8, 1949, only if such reversionary interest arose by the express terms of the instrument of transfer), and the value of such reversionary interest immediately before the death of the decedent exceeds 5 percent of the value of such property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;reversionary interest&rdquo; includes a possibility that property transferred by the decedent&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may return to him or his estate, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may be subject to a power of disposition by him,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">but such term does not include a possibility that the income alone from such property may return to him or become subject to a power of disposition by him. The value of a reversionary interest immediately before the death of the decedent shall be determined (without regard to the fact of the decedent's death) by usual methods of valuation, including the use of tables of mortality and actuarial principles, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. In determining the value of a possibility that property may be subject to a power of disposition by the decedent, such possibility shall be valued as if it were a possibility that such property may return to the decedent or his estate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an interest so transferred shall not be included in the decedent's gross estate under this section if possession or enjoyment of the property could have been obtained by any beneficiary during the decedent's life through the exercise of a general power of appointment (as defined in section 2041) which in fact was exercisable immediately before the decedent's death.</p>

Except in the case of transfers made after June 22, 1936, no interest of the decedent of which he has made a transfer shall be included in the gross estate under paragraph (1) unless it is includible under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Date of existence of power</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the power to alter, amend, revoke, or terminate shall be considered to exist on the date of the decedent's death even though the exercise of the power is subject to a precedent giving of notice or even though the alteration, amendment, revocation, or termination takes effect only on the expiration of a stated period after the exercise of the power, whether or not on or before the date of the decedent's death notice has been given or the power has been exercised. In such cases proper adjustment shall be made representing the interests which would have been excluded from the power if the decedent had lived, and for such purpose, if the notice has not been given or the power has not been exercised on or before the date of his death, such notice shall be considered to have been given, or the power exercised, on the date of his death.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (a)&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General power of appointment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;general power of appointment&rdquo; means a power which is exercisable in favor of the decedent, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate; except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A power to consume, invade, or appropriate property for the benefit of the decedent which is limited by an ascertainable standard relating to the health, education, support, or maintenance of the decedent shall not be deemed a general power of appointment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A power of appointment created on or before October 21, 1942, which is exercisable by the decedent only in conjunction with another person shall not be deemed a general power of appointment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) In the case of a power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, which is exercisable by the decedent only in conjunction with another person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) If the power is not exercisable by the decedent except in conjunction with the creator of the power&mdash;such power shall not be deemed a general power of appointment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) If the power is not exercisable by the decedent except in conjunction with a person having a substantial interest in the property, subject to the power, which is adverse to exercise of the power in favor of the decedent&mdash;such power shall not be deemed a general power of appointment. For the purposes of this clause a person who, after the death of the decedent, may be possessed of a power of appointment (with respect to the property subject to the decedent's power) which he may exercise in his own favor shall be deemed as having an interest in the property and such interest shall be deemed adverse to such exercise of the decedent's power.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) If (after the application of clauses (i) and (ii)) the power is a general power of appointment and is exercisable in favor of such other person&mdash;such power shall be deemed a general power of appointment only in respect of a fractional part of the property subject to such power, such part to be determined by dividing the value of such property by the number of such persons (including the decedent) in favor of whom such power is exercisable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of clauses (ii) and (iii), a power shall be deemed to be exercisable in favor of a person if it is exercisable in favor of such person, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Lapse of power</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The lapse of a power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, during the life of the individual possessing the power shall be considered a release of such power. The preceding sentence shall apply with respect to the lapse of powers during any calendar year only to the extent that the property, which could have been appointed by exercise of such lapsed powers, exceeded in value, at the time of such lapse, the greater of the following amounts:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) $5,000, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 5 percent of the aggregate value, at the time of such lapse, of the assets out of which, or the proceeds of which, the exercise of the lapsed powers could have been satisfied.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Date of creation of power</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, a power of appointment created by a will executed on or before October 21, 1942, shall be considered a power created on or before such date if the person executing such will dies before July 1, 1949, without having republished such will, by codicil or otherwise, after October 21, 1942.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitations applicable to subsections (a) and (b)</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Consideration for claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The deduction allowed by this section in the case of claims against the estate, unpaid mortgages, or any indebtedness shall, when founded on a promise or agreement, be limited to the extent that they were contracted bona fide and for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth; except that in any case in which any such claim is founded on a promise or agreement of the decedent to make a contribution or gift to or for the use of any donee described in section 2055 for the purposes specified therein, the deduction for such claims shall not be so limited, but shall be limited to the extent that it would be allowable as a deduction under section 2055 if such promise or agreement constituted a bequest.</p>

For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;property subject to claims&rdquo; means property includible in the gross estate of the decedent which, or the avails of which, would under the applicable law, bear the burden of the payment of such deductions in the final adjustment and settlement of the estate, except that the value of the property shall be reduced by the amount of the deduction under section 2054 attributable to such property.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The determination under subparagraph (B) of the country within which property is situated shall be made in accordance with the rules applicable under subchapter B (sec. 2101 and following) in determining whether property is situated within or without the United States. Any election under this paragraph shall be exercised in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Condition for allowance of deduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No deduction shall be allowed under paragraph (1) for a State death tax or a foreign death tax specified therein unless the decrease in the tax imposed by section 2001 which results from the deduction provided in paragraph (1) will inure solely for the benefit of the public, charitable, or religious transferees described in section 2055 or section 2106(a)(2). In any case where the tax imposed by section 2001 is equitably apportioned among all the transferees of property included in the gross estate, including those described in sections 2055 and 2106(a)(2) (taking into account any exemptions, credits, or deductions allowed by this chapter), in determining such decrease, there shall be disregarded any decrease in the Federal estate tax which any transferees other than those described in sections 2055 and 2106(a)(2) are required to pay.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect on credits for State and foreign death taxes of deduction under this subsection</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An election under this subsection shall be deemed a waiver of the right to claim a credit, against the Federal estate tax, under a death tax convention with any foreign country for any tax or portion thereof in respect of which a deduction is taken under this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation in the case of life estate or other terminable interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where, on the lapse of time, on the occurrence of an event or contingency, or on the failure of an event or contingency to occur, an interest passing to the surviving spouse will terminate or fail, no deduction shall be allowed under this section with respect to such interest&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if an interest in such property passes or has passed (for less than an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth) from the decedent to any person other than such surviving spouse (or the estate of such spouse); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if by reason of such passing such person (or his heirs or assigns) may possess or enjoy any part of such property after such termination or failure of the interest so passing to the surviving spouse;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this paragraph, an interest shall not be considered as an interest which will terminate or fail merely because it is the ownership of a bond, note, or similar contractual obligation, the discharge of which would not have the effect of an annuity for life or for a term.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Interest in unidentified assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where the assets (included in the decedent's gross estate) out of which, or the proceeds of which, an interest passing to the surviving spouse may be satisfied include a particular asset or assets with respect to which no deduction would be allowed if such asset or assets passed from the decedent to such spouse, then the value of such interest passing to such spouse shall, for purposes of subsection (a), be reduced by the aggregate value of such particular assets.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Interest of spouse conditional on survival for limited period</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Valuation of interest passing to surviving spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining for purposes of subsection (a) the value of any interest in property passing to the surviving spouse for which a deduction is allowed by this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) there shall be taken into account the effect which the tax imposed by section 2001, or any estate, succession, legacy, or inheritance tax, has on the net value to the surviving spouse of such interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) where such interest or property is encumbered in any manner, or where the surviving spouse incurs any obligation imposed by the decedent with respect to the passing of such interest, such encumbrance or obligation shall be taken into account in the same manner as if the amount of a gift to such spouse of such interest were being determined.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Life estate with power of appointment in surviving spouse</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">This paragraph shall apply only if such power in the surviving spouse to appoint the entire interest, or such specific portion thereof, whether exercisable by will or during life, is exercisable by such spouse alone and in all events.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Life insurance or annuity payments with power of appointment in surviving spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an interest in property passing from the decedent consisting of proceeds under a life insurance, endowment, or annuity contract, if under the terms of the contract such proceeds are payable in installments or are held by the insurer subject to an agreement to pay interest thereon (whether the proceeds, on the termination of any interest payments, are payable in a lump sum or in annual or more frequent installments), and such installment or interest payments are payable annually or at more frequent intervals, commencing not later than 13 months after the decedent's death, and all amounts, or a specific portion of all such amounts, payable during the life of the surviving spouse are payable only to such spouse, and such spouse has the power to appoint all amounts, or such specific portion, payable under such contract (exercisable in favor of such surviving spouse, or of the estate of such surviving spouse, or in favor of either, whether or not in each case the power is exercisable in favor of others), with no power in any other person to appoint such amounts to any person other than the surviving spouse&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such amounts shall, for purposes of subsection (a), be considered as passing to the surviving spouse, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) no part of such amounts shall, for purposes of paragraph (1)(A), be considered as passing to any person other than the surviving spouse.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">This paragraph shall apply only if, under the terms of the contract, such power in the surviving spouse to appoint such amounts, whether exercisable by will or during life, is exercisable by such spouse alone and in all events.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Election with respect to life estate for surviving spouse</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of qualified terminable interest property&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for purposes of subsection (a), such property shall be treated as passing to the surviving spouse, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for purposes of paragraph (1)(A), no part of such property shall be treated as passing to any person other than the surviving spouse.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Qualified terminable interest property defined</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provides that no distribution (other than a distribution of income) may be made from the trust unless a trustee who is an individual citizen of the United States or a domestic corporation has the right to withhold from such distribution the tax imposed by this section on such distribution,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such trust meets such requirements as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe to ensure the collection of any tax imposed by subsection (b), and</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the tax imposed on the estate of the decedent under section 2001 is not finally determined before the taxable event, the amount of the tax imposed by paragraph (1) on such event shall be determined by using the highest rate of tax in effect under section 2001 as of the date of the decedent's death.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Refund of excess when tax finally determined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If there is more than 1 qualified domestic trust with respect to any decedent, the <!-- PDFPage:1765 -->amount of the tax imposed by paragraph (1) with respect to such trusts shall be determined by using the highest rate of tax in effect under section 2001 as of the date of the decedent's death (and the provisions of paragraph (3)(B) shall not apply) unless, pursuant to a designation made by the decedent's executor, there is 1 person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) who is an individual citizen of the United States or a domestic corporation and is responsible for filing all returns of tax imposed under paragraph (1) with respect to such trusts and for paying all tax so imposed, and</p>

<!-- PDFPage:1766 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to treat any reduction in the tax imposed by paragraph (1)(A) by reason of the credit allowable under section 2010 with respect to the decedent as a credit allowable to such surviving spouse under section 2505 for purposes of determining the amount of the credit allowable under section 2505 with respect to taxable gifts made by the surviving spouse during the year in which the spouse becomes a citizen or any subsequent year,</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(15) No tax on certain distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No tax shall be imposed by paragraph (1) on any distribution to the surviving spouse to the extent such distribution is to reimburse such surviving spouse for any tax imposed by subtitle A on any item of income of the trust to which such surviving spouse is not entitled under the terms of the trust.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Rate of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A tax computed in accordance with the table contained in section 2001 is hereby imposed on the transfer of the taxable estate, determined as provided in section 2106, of every decedent nonresident not a citizen of the United States dying after November 13, 1966, if after March 8, 1965, and within the 10-year period ending with the date of death such decedent lost United States citizenship, unless such loss did not have for one of its principal purposes the avoidance of taxes under this subtitle or subtitle A.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Gross estate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of the tax imposed by subsection (a), the value of the gross estate of every decedent to whom subsection (a) applies shall be determined as provided in section 2103, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if such decedent owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)) at the time of his death 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of a foreign corporation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if such decedent owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)), or is considered to have owned (by applying the ownership rules of section 958(b)), at the time of his death, more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of such foreign corporation,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then that proportion of the fair market value of the stock of such foreign corporation owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)) by such decedent at the time of his death, which the fair market value of any assets owned by such foreign corporation and situated in the United States, at the time of his death, bears to the total fair market value of all assets owned by such foreign corporation at the time of his death, shall be included in the gross estate of such decedent. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a decedent shall be treated as owning stock of a foreign corporation at the time of his death if, at the time of a transfer, by trust or otherwise, within the meaning of sections 2035 to 2038, inclusive, he owned such stock.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Credits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Unified credit</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A credit of $13,000 shall be allowed against the tax imposed by subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation based on amount of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The credit allowed under this paragraph shall not exceed the amount of the tax imposed by subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other credits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The tax imposed by subsection (a) shall be credited with the amounts determined in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) of section 2102. For purposes of subsection (a) of section 2102, sections 2011 to 2013, inclusive, shall be applied as if the credit allowed under paragraph (1) were allowed under section 2010.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exception for loss of citizenship for certain causes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) shall not apply to the transfer of the estate of a decedent whose loss of United States citizenship resulted from the application of section 301(b), 350, or 355&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2107_1_target" name="2107_1">1</a></sup> of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1401(b), 1482, or 1487).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary establishes that it is reasonable to believe that an individual's loss of United States citizenship would, but for this section, result in a substantial reduction in the estate, inheritance, legacy, and succession taxes in respect of the transfer of his estate, the burden of proving that such loss of citizenship did not have for one of its principal purposes the avoidance of taxes under this subtitle or subtitle A shall be on the executor of such individual's estate.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the executor makes written application to the Secretary for determination of the amount of the tax and discharge from personal liability therefor, the Secretary (as soon as possible, and in any event within 9 months after the making of such application, or, if the application is made before the return is filed, then within 9 months after the return is filed, but not after the expiration of the period prescribed for the assessment of the tax in section 6501) shall notify the executor of the amount of the tax. The executor, on payment of the amount of which he is notified (other than any amount the time for payment of which is extended under sections 6161, 6163, or 6166), and on furnishing any bond which may be required for any amount for which the time for payment is extended, shall be discharged from personal liability for any deficiency in tax thereafter found to be due and shall be entitled to a receipt or writing showing such discharge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Fiduciary other than the executor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a fiduciary (not including a fiduciary in respect of the estate of a nonresident decedent) other than the executor makes written application to the Secretary for determination of the amount of any estate tax for which the fiduciary may be personally liable, and for discharge from personal liability therefor, the Secretary upon the discharge of the executor from personal liability under subsection (a), or upon the expiration of 6 months after the making of such application by the fiduciary, if later, shall notify the fiduciary (1) of the amount of such tax for which it has been determined the fiduciary is liable, or (2) that it has been determined that the fiduciary is not liable for any such tax. Such application shall be accompanied by a copy of the in<!-- PDFPage:1776 -->strument, if any, under which such fiduciary is acting, a description of the property held by the fiduciary, and such other information for purposes of carrying out the provisions of this section as the Secretary may require by regulations. On payment of the amount of such tax for which it has been determined the fiduciary is liable (other than any amount the time for payment of which has been extended under section 6161, 6163, or 6166), and on furnishing any bond which may be required for any amount for which the time for payment has been extended, or on receipt by him of notification of a determination that he is not liable for any such tax, the fiduciary shall be discharged from personal liability for any deficiency in such tax thereafter found to be due and shall be entitled to a receipt or writing evidencing such discharge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special lien under section 6324A</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of the second sentence of subsection (a) and the last sentence of subsection (b), an agreement which meets the requirements of section 6324A (relating to special lien for estate tax deferred under section 6166) shall be treated as the furnishing of bond with respect to the amount for which the time for payment has been extended under section 6166.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Good faith reliance on gift tax returns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the executor in good faith relies on gift tax returns furnished under section 6103(e)(3) for determining the decedent's adjusted taxable gifts, the executor shall be discharged from personal liability with respect to any deficiency of the tax imposed by this chapter which is attributable to adjusted taxable gifts which&mdash;</p>
