<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) employees not included in a dependent care assistance program who are included in a unit of employees covered by an agreement which the Secretary finds to be a collective bargaining agreement between employee representatives and 1 or more employees, if there is evidence that dependent care benefits were the subject of good faith bargaining between such employee representatives and such employer or employers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions and special rules</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Treatment of qualified funding asset</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any qualified funding asset&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the basis of such asset shall be reduced by the amount excluded from gross income under subsection (a) by reason of the purchase of such asset, and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Qualified assignment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;qualified assignment&rdquo; means any assignment of a liability to make periodic payments as damages (whether by suit or agreement) on account of personal injury or sickness (in a case involving physical injury or physical sickness)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) such periodic payments are excludable from the gross income of the recipient under section 104(a)(2).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The determination for purposes of this chapter of when the recipient is treated as having received any payment with respect to which there has been a qualified assignment shall be made without regard to any provision of such assignment which grants the recipient rights as a creditor greater than those of a general creditor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Qualified funding asset</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;qualified funding asset&rdquo; means any annuity contract issued by a company licensed to do business as an insurance company under the laws of any State, or any obligation of the United States, if&mdash;</p>
