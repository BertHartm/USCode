<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) which includes only amounts received from transfers which meet the requirements of this paragraph,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) which is maintained by the organization to which the remainder interest is contributed and of which no donor or beneficiary of an income interest is a trustee, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) from which each beneficiary of an income interest receives income, for each year for which he is entitled to receive the income interest referred to in subparagraph (A), determined by the rate of return earned by the trust for such year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of determining the amount of any charitable contribution allowable by reason of a transfer of property to a pooled fund, the value of the income interest shall be determined on the basis of the highest rate of return earned by the fund for any of the 3 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year of the fund in which the transfer is made. In the case of funds in existence less than 3 taxable years preceding the taxable year of the fund in which a transfer is made the rate of return shall be deemed to be 6 percent per annum, except that the Secretary may prescribe a different rate of return.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Taxable private foundations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a private foundation which is not exempt from taxation under section 501(a) for the taxable year, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply and the provisions of section 170 shall apply.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Amortization deductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The benefit of the deductions for amortization provided by sections 169 and 197 shall be allowed to estates and trusts in the same manner as in the case of an individual. The allowable deduction shall be apportioned between the income beneficiaries and the fiduciary under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Disallowance of double deductions</h4>
