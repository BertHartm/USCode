<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of the acquisition of assets of a corporation by another corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in a distribution to such other corporation to which section 332 (relating to liquidations of subsidiaries) applies; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in a transfer to which section 361 (relating to nonrecognition of gain or loss to corporations) applies, but only if the transfer is in connection with a reorganization described in subparagraph (A), (C), (D), (F), or (G) of section 368(a)(1),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the acquiring corporation shall succeed to and take into account, as of the close of the day of distribution or transfer, the items described in subsection (c) of the distributor or transferor corporation, subject to the conditions and limitations specified in subsections (b) and (c). For purposes of the preceding sentence, a reorganization shall be treated as meeting the requirements of subparagraph (D) or (G) of section 368(a)(1) only if the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 354(b)(1) are met.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Operating rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except in the case of an acquisition in connection with a reorganization described in subparagraph (F) of section 368(a)(1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation shall end on the date of distribution or transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) For purposes of this section, the date of distribution or transfer shall be the day on which the distribution or transfer is completed; except that, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the date when substantially all of the property has been distributed or transferred may be used if the distributor or transferor corporation ceases all operations, other than liquidating activities, after such date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The corporation acquiring property in a distribution or transfer described in subsection (a) shall not be entitled to carry back a net operating loss or a net capital loss for a taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer to a taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Items of the distributor or transferor corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The items referred to in subsection (a) are:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Net operating loss carryovers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The net operating loss carryovers determined under section 172, subject to the following conditions and limitations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the taxable year of the acquiring corporation to which the net operating loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation are first carried shall be the first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) In determining the net operating loss deduction, the portion of such deduction attributable to the net operating loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation to the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation ending after the date of distribution or transfer shall be limited to an amount which bears the same ratio to the taxable income (determined without regard to a net operating loss deduction) of the acquiring corporation in such taxable year as the number of days in the taxable year after the date of distribution or transfer bears to the total number of days in the taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) For the purpose of determining the amount of the net operating loss carryovers under section 172(b)(2), a net operating loss for a taxable year (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the &ldquo;loss year&rdquo;) of a distributor or transferor corporation which ends on or before the end of a loss year of the acquiring corporation shall be considered to be a net operating loss for a year prior to such loss year of the acquiring corporation. For the same purpose, the taxable income for a &ldquo;prior taxable year&rdquo; (as the term is used in section 172(b)(2)) shall be <!-- PDFPage:772 -->computed as provided in such section; except that, if the date of distribution or transfer is on a day other than the last day of a taxable year of the acquiring corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such taxable year shall (for the purpose of this subparagraph only) be considered to be 2 taxable years (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the &ldquo;pre-acquisition part year&rdquo; and the &ldquo;post-acquisition part year&rdquo;);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the pre-acquisition part year shall begin on the same day as such taxable year begins and shall end on the date of distribution or transfer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the post-acquisition part year shall begin on the day following the date of distribution or transfer and shall end on the same day as the end of such taxable year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the taxable income for such taxable year (computed with the modifications specified in section 172(b)(2)(A) but without a net operating loss deduction) shall be divided between the pre-acquisition part year and the post-acquisition part year in proportion to the number of days in each;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the net operating loss deduction for the pre-acquisition part year shall be determined as provided in section 172(b)(2)(B), but without regard to a net operating loss year of the distributor or transferor corporation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) the net operating loss deduction for the post-acquisition part year shall be determined as provided in section 172(b)(2)(B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Earnings and profits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a distribution or transfer described in subsection (a)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the earnings and profits or deficit in earnings and profits, as the case may be, of the distributor or transferor corporation shall, subject to subparagraph (B), be deemed to have been received or incurred by the acquiring corporation as of the close of the date of the distribution or transfer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a deficit in earnings and profits of the distributor, transferor, or acquiring corporation shall be used only to offset earnings and profits accumulated after the date of transfer. For this purpose, the earnings and profits for the taxable year of the acquiring corporation in which the distribution or transfer occurs shall be deemed to have been accumulated after such distribution or transfer in an amount which bears the same ratio to the undistributed earnings and profits of the acquiring corporation for such taxable year (computed without regard to any earnings and profits received from the distributor or transferor corporation, as described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph) as the number of days in the taxable year after the date of distribution or transfer bears to the total number of days in the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Capital loss carryover</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The capital loss carryover determined under section 1212, subject to the following conditions and limitations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The taxable year of the acquiring corporation to which the capital loss carryover of the distributor or transferor corporation is first carried shall be the first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The capital loss carryover shall be a short-term capital loss in the taxable year determined under subparagraph (A) but shall be limited to an amount which bears the same ratio to the capital gain net income (determined without regard to a short-term capital loss attributable to capital loss carryover), if any, of the acquiring corporation in such taxable year as the number of days in the taxable year after the date of distribution or transfer bears to the total number of days in the taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) For purposes of determining the amount of such capital loss carryover to taxable years following the taxable year determined under subparagraph (A), the capital gain net income in the taxable year determined under subparagraph (A) shall be considered to be an amount equal to the amount determined under subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Method of accounting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The acquiring corporation shall use the method of accounting used by the distributor or transferor corporation on the date of distribution or transfer unless different methods were used by several distributor or transferor corporations or by a distributor or transferor corporation and the acquiring corporation. If different methods were used, the acquiring corporation shall use the method or combination of methods of computing taxable income adopted pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Inventories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which inventories are received by the acquiring corporation, such inventories shall be taken by such corporation (in determining its income) on the same basis on which such inventories were taken by the distributor or transferor corporation, unless different methods were used by several distributor or transferor corporations or by a distributor or transferor corporation and the acquiring corporation. If different methods were used, the acquiring corporation shall use the method or combination of methods of taking inventory adopted pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Method of computing depreciation allowance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation for purposes of computing the depreciation allowance under sections 167 and 168 on property acquired in a distribution or transfer with respect to so much of the basis in the hands of the acquiring corporation as does not exceed the adjusted basis in the hands of the distributor or transferor corporation.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Installment method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the acquiring corporation acquires installment obligations (the income from which the <!-- PDFPage:773 -->distributor or transferor corporation reports on the installment basis under section 453) the acquiring corporation shall, for purposes of section 453, be treated as if it were the distributor or transferor corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Amortization of bond discount or premium</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the acquiring corporation is entitled to the recovery of any amounts previously deducted by (or allowable as credits to) the distributor or transferor corporation, the acquiring corporation shall succeed to the treatment under section 111 which would apply to such amounts in the hands of the distributor or transferor corporation.</p>
