<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirement of withholding</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this section, every employer making payment of wages shall deduct and withhold upon such wages a tax determined in accordance with tables or computational procedures prescribed by the Secretary. Any tables or procedures prescribed under this paragraph shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) apply with respect to the amount of wages paid during such periods as the Secretary may prescribe, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) be in such form, and provide for such amounts to be deducted and withheld, as the Secretary determines to be most appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter and to reflect the provisions of chapter 1 applicable to such periods.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of wages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of applying tables or procedures prescribed under paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;the amount of wages&rdquo; means the amount by which the wages exceed the number of withholding exemptions claimed multiplied by the amount of one such exemption. The amount of each withholding exemption shall be equal to the amount of one personal exemption provided in section 151(b), prorated to the payroll period. The maximum number of withholding exemptions permitted shall be calculated in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary under this section, taking into account any reduction in withholding to which an employee is entitled under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Percentage method of withholding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If wages are paid with respect to a period which is not a payroll period, the withholding exemption allowable with respect to each payment of such wages shall be the exemption allowed for a miscellaneous payroll period containing a number of days (including Sundays and holidays) equal to the number of days in the period with respect to which such wages are paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which wages are paid by an employer without regard to any payroll period or other period, the withholding exemption allowable with respect to each payment of such wages shall be the exemption allowed for a miscellaneous payroll period containing a number of days equal to the number of days (including Sundays and holidays) which have elapsed since the date of the last payment of such wages by such employer during the calendar year, or the date of commencement of employment with such employer during such year, or January 1 of such year, whichever is the later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any case in which the period, or the time described in paragraph (2), in respect of any wages is less than one week, the Secretary, under regulations prescribed by him, may authorize an employer to compute the tax to be deducted and withheld as if the aggregate of the wages paid to the employee during the calendar week were paid for a weekly payroll period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In determining the amount to be deducted and withheld under this subsection, the wages may, at the election of the employer, be computed to the nearest dollar.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Wage bracket withholding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) At the election of the employer with respect to any employee, the employer shall deduct and withhold upon the wages paid to such employee a tax (in lieu of the tax required to be deducted and withheld under subsection (a)) determined in accordance with tables prescribed by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (6).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If wages are paid with respect to a period which is not a payroll period, the amount to be deducted and withheld shall be that applicable in the case of a miscellaneous payroll period containing a number of days (including Sundays and holidays) equal to the number of days in the period with respect to which such wages are paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any case in which wages are paid by an employer without regard to any payroll period or other period, the amount to be deducted and withheld shall be that applicable in the case of a miscellaneous payroll period containing a <!-- PDFPage:2267 -->number of days equal to the number of days (including Sundays and holidays) which have elapsed since the date of the last payment of such wages by such employer during the calendar year, or the date of commencement of employment with such employer during such year, or January 1 of such year, whichever is the later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In any case in which the period, or the time described in paragraph (3), in respect of any wages is less than one week, the Secretary, under regulations prescribed by him, may authorize an employer to determine the amount to be deducted and withheld under the tables applicable in the case of a weekly payroll period, in which case the aggregate of the wages paid to the employee during the calendar week shall be considered the weekly wages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the wages exceed the highest wage bracket, in determining the amount to be deducted and withheld under this subsection, the wages may, at the election of the employer, be computed to the nearest dollar.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In the case of wages paid after December 31, 1969, the amount deducted and withheld under paragraph (1) shall be determined in accordance with tables prescribed by the Secretary. In the tables so prescribed, the amounts set forth as amounts of wages and amounts of income tax to be deducted and withheld shall be computed on the basis of the table for an annual payroll period prescribed pursuant to subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Tax paid by recipient</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the employer, in violation of the provisions of this chapter, fails to deduct and withhold the tax under this chapter, and thereafter the tax against which such tax may be credited is paid, the tax so required to be deducted and withheld shall not be collected from the employer; but this subsection shall in no case relieve the employer from liability for any penalties or additions to the tax otherwise applicable in respect of such failure to deduct and withhold.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Included and excluded wages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the remuneration paid by an employer to an employee for services performed during one-half or more of any payroll period of not more than 31 consecutive days constitutes wages, all the remuneration paid by such employer to such employee for such period shall be deemed to be wages; but if the remuneration paid by an employer to an employee for services performed during more than one-half of any such payroll period does not constitute wages, then none of the remuneration paid by such employer to such employee for such period shall be deemed to be wages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Withholding exemptions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An employee receiving wages shall on any day be entitled to the following withholding exemptions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an exemption for himself unless he is an individual described in section 151(d)(2);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the employee is married, any exemption to which his spouse is entitled, or would be entitled if such spouse were an employee receiving wages, under subparagraph (A) or (D), but only if such spouse does not have in effect a withholding exemption certificate claiming such exemption;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) an exemption for each individual with respect to whom, on the basis of facts existing at the beginning of such day, there may reasonably be expected to be allowable an exemption under section 151(c) for the taxable year under subtitle A in respect of which amounts deducted and withheld under this chapter in the calendar year in which such day falls are allowed as a credit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any allowance to which he is entitled under subsection (m), but only if his spouse does not have in effect a withholding exemption certificate claiming such allowance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) a standard deduction allowance which shall be an amount equal to one exemption (or more than one exemption if so prescribed by the Secretary) unless (i) he is married (as determined under section 7703) and his spouse is an employee receiving wages subject to withholding or (ii) he has withholding exemption certificates in effect with respect to more than one employer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this title, any standard deduction allowance under subparagraph (E) shall be treated as if it were denominated a withholding exemption.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exemption certificates</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) On commencement of employment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">On or before the date of the commencement of employment with an employer, the employee shall furnish the employer with a signed withholding exemption certificate relating to the number of withholding exemptions which he claims, which shall in no event exceed the number to which he is entitled.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Change of status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, on any day during the calendar year, the number of withholding exemptions to which the employee is entitled is less than the number of withholding exemptions claimed by the employee on the withholding exemption certificate then in effect with respect to him, the employee shall within 10 days thereafter furnish the employer with a new withholding exemption certificate relating to the number of withholding exemptions which the employee then claims, which shall in no event exceed the number to which he is entitled on such day. If, on any day during the calendar year, the number of withholding exemptions to which the employee is entitled is greater than the number of withholding exemptions claimed, the employee may furnish the employer with a new withholding exemption certificate relating to the number of withholding exemptions which the employee then claims, which shall in no event exceed the number to which he is entitled on such day.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Change of status which affects next calendar year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If on any day during the calendar year the number of withholding exemptions to which the employee will be, or may reasonably be <!-- PDFPage:2268 -->expected to be, entitled at the beginning of his next taxable year under subtitle A is different from the number to which the employee is entitled on such day, the employee shall, in such cases and at such times as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe, furnish the employer with a withholding exemption certificate relating to the number of withholding exemptions which he claims with respect to such next taxable year, which shall in no event exceed the number to which he will be, or may reasonably be expected to be, so entitled.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) When certificate takes effect</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) First certificate furnished</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A withholding exemption certificate furnished the employer in cases in which no previous such certificate is in effect shall take effect as of the beginning of the first payroll period ending, or the first payment of wages made without regard to a payroll period, on or after the date on which such certificate is so furnished.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Furnished to take place of existing certificate</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided in clauses (ii) and (iii), a withholding exemption certificate furnished to the employer in cases in which a previous such certificate is in effect shall take effect as of the beginning of the 1st payroll period ending (or the 1st payment of wages made without regard to a payroll period) on or after the 30th day after the day on which such certificate is so furnished.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Employer may elect earlier effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">At the election of the employer, a certificate described in clause (i) may be made effective beginning with any payment of wages made on or after the day on which the certificate is so furnished and before the 30th day referred to in clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Change of status which affects next year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any certificate furnished pursuant to paragraph (2)(C) shall not take effect, and may not be made effective, with respect to any payment of wages made in the calendar year in which the certificate is furnished.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Period during which certificate remains in effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A withholding exemption certificate which takes effect under this subsection, or which on December 31, 1954, was in effect under the corresponding subsection of prior law, shall continue in effect with respect to the employer until another such certificate takes effect under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Form and contents of certificate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Withholding exemption certificates shall be in such form and contain such information as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Exemption where certificate with another employer is in effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a withholding exemption certificate is in effect with respect to one employer, an employee shall not be entitled under a certificate in effect with any other employer to any withholding exemption which he has claimed under such first certificate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Overlapping pay periods, and payment by agent or fiduciary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a payment of wages is made to an employee by an employer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) with respect to a payroll period or other period, any part of which is included in a payroll period or other period with respect to which wages are also paid to such employee by such employer, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) without regard to any payroll period or other period, but on or prior to the expiration of a payroll period or other period with respect to which wages are also paid to such employee by such employer, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) with respect to a period beginning in one and ending in another calendar year, or</p>
