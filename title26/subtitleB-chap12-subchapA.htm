<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may be expended by, or for the benefit of, the donee before his attaining the age of 21 years, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If any individual waives, before the death of a participant, any survivor benefit, or right to such benefit, under section 401(a)(11) or 417, such waiver shall not be treated as a transfer of property by gift for purposes of this chapter.</p>
