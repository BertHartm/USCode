<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subtitle, the term &ldquo;regulated investment company&rdquo; means any domestic corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) which, at all times during the taxable year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;1 to 80b&ndash;2) as a management company or unit investment trust, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has in effect an election under such Act to be treated as a business development company, or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) which is a common trust fund or similar fund excluded by section 3(c)(3) of such Act (15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;3(c)) from the definition of &ldquo;investment company&rdquo; and is not included in the definition of &ldquo;common trust fund&rdquo; by section 584(a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A corporation shall not be considered a regulated investment company for any taxable year unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it files with its return for the taxable year an election to be a regulated investment company or has made such election for a previous taxable year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) at least 90 percent of its gross income is derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans (as defined in section 512(a)(5)), and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities (as defined in section 2(a)(36) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended) or foreign currencies, or other income (including but not limited to gains from options, futures, or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities, or currencies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) at the close of each quarter of the taxable year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) at least 50 percent of the value of its total assets is represented by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) cash and cash items (including receivables), Government securities and securi<!-- PDFPage:1364 -->ties of other regulated investment companies, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) other securities for purposes of this calculation limited, except and to the extent provided in subsection (e), in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater in value than 5 percent of the value of the total assets of the taxpayer and to not more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not more than 25 percent of the value of its total assets is invested in the securities (other than Government securities or the securities of other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer, or of two or more issuers which the taxpayer controls and which are determined, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to be engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of paragraph (2), there shall be treated as dividends amounts included in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A)(i) or 1293(a) for the taxable year to the extent that, under section 959(a)(1) or 1293(c) (as the case may be), there is a distribution out of the earnings and profits of the taxable year which are attributable to the amounts so included. For purposes of paragraph (2), the Secretary may by regulation exclude from qualifying income foreign currency gains which are not directly related to the company's principal business of investing in stock or securities (or options and futures with respect to stock or securities). For purposes of paragraph (2), amounts excludable from gross income under section 103(a) shall be treated as included in gross income. Income derived from a partnership or trust shall be treated as described in paragraph (2) only to the extent such income is attributable to items of income of the partnership or trust (as the case may be) which would be described in paragraph (2) if realized by the regulated investment company in the same manner as realized by the partnership or trust.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rules applicable to subsection (b)(3)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (b)(3) and this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In ascertaining the value of the taxpayer's investment in the securities of an issuer, for the purposes of subparagraph (B), there shall be included its proper proportion of the investment of any other corporation, a member of a controlled group, in the securities of such issuer, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;controls&rdquo; means the ownership in a corporation of 20 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;controlled group&rdquo; means one or more chains of corporations connected through stock ownership with the taxpayer if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 20 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of each of the corporations (except the taxpayer) is owned directly by one or more of the other corporations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the taxpayer owns directly 20 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, of at least one of the other corporations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The term &ldquo;value&rdquo; means, with respect to securities (other than those of majority-owned subsidiaries) for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such securities; and with respect to other securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith by the board of directors, except that in the case of securities of majority-owned subsidiaries which are investment companies such fair value shall not exceed market value or asset value, whichever is higher.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) All other terms shall have the same meaning as when used in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A corporation which meets the requirements of subsections (b)(3) and (c) at the close of any quarter shall not lose its status as a regulated investment company because of a discrepancy during a subsequent quarter between the value of its various investments and such requirements unless such discrepancy exists immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property and is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition. A corporation which does not meet such requirements at the close of any quarter by reason of a discrepancy existing immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property which is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition during such quarter shall not lose its status for such quarter as a regulated investment company if such discrepancy is eliminated within 30 days after the close of such quarter and in such cases it shall be considered to have met such requirements at the close of such quarter for purposes of applying the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Investment companies furnishing capital to development corporations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Securities and Exchange Commission determines, in accordance with regulations issued by it, and certifies to the Secretary not earlier than 60 days prior to the close of the taxable year of a management company or a business development company described in subsection (a)(1), that such investment company is principally engaged in the furnishing of capital to other corporations which are principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions, technological improvements, new processes, or products not previously generally available, such investment company may, in the computation of 50 percent of the value of its assets under subparagraph (A) of subsection (b)(3) for any quarter of such taxable year, include the value of any securities of an issuer, whether or not the investment company owns more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, the basis of which, when added to the basis of the investment company for securities of such issuer previously acquired, did not exceed 5 percent of the value of the total assets of the investment company at the time of the subsequent acquisition of securities. The preceding sentence shall not apply to the <!-- PDFPage:1365 -->securities of an issuer if the investment company has continuously held any security of such issuer (or of any predecessor company of such issuer as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) for 10 or more years preceding such quarter of such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of this subsection shall not apply at the close of any quarter of a taxable year to an investment company if at the close of such quarter more than 25 percent of the value of its total assets is represented by securities of issuers with respect to each of which the investment company holds more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and in respect of each of which or any predecessor thereof the investment company has continuously held any security for 10 or more years preceding such quarter unless the value of its total assets so represented is reduced to 25 percent or less within 30 days after the close of such quarter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determination of status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, unless the Securities and Exchange Commission determines otherwise, a corporation shall be considered to be principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions, technological improvements, new processes, or products not previously generally available, for at least 10 years after the date of the first acquisition of any security in such corporation or any predecessor thereof by such investment company if at the date of such acquisition the corporation or its predecessor was principally so engaged, and an investment company shall be considered at any date to be furnishing capital to any company whose securities it holds if within 10 years prior to such date it has acquired any of such securities, or any securities surrendered in exchange therefor, from such other company or predecessor thereof. For purposes of the certification under this subsection, the Securities and Exchange Commission shall have authority to issue such rules, regulations and orders, and to conduct such investigations and hearings, either public or private, as it may deem appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The terms used in this subsection shall have the same meaning as in subsections (b)(3) and (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Certain unit investment trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A unit investment trust (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which is registered under such Act and issues periodic payment plan certificates (as defined in such Act) in one or more series,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) substantially all of the assets of which, as to all such series, consist of (i) securities issued by a single management company (as defined in such Act) and securities acquired pursuant to subparagraph (C), or (ii) securities issued by a single other corporation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) which has no power to invest in any other securities except securities issued by a single other management company, when permitted by such Act or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall not be treated as a person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In the case of a unit investment trust described in paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) each holder of an interest in such trust shall, to the extent of such interest, be treated as owning a proportionate share of the assets of such trust;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the basis of the assets of such trust which are treated under subparagraph (A) as being owned by a holder of an interest in such trust shall be the same as the basis of his interest in such trust; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in determining the period for which the holder of an interest in such trust has held the assets of the trust which are treated under subparagraph (A) as being owned by him, there shall be included the period for which such holder has held his interest in such trust.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">This subsection shall not apply in the case of a unit investment trust which is a segregated asset account under the insurance laws or regulations of a State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Special rule for series funds</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a regulated investment company (within the meaning of subsection (a)) having more than one fund, each fund of such regulated investment company shall be treated as a separate corporation for purposes of this title (except with respect to the definitional requirement of subsection (a)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Fund defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1) the term &ldquo;fund&rdquo; means a segregated portfolio of assets, the beneficial interests in which are owned by the holders of a class or series of stock of the regulated investment company that is preferred over all other classes or series in respect of such portfolio of assets.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirements applicable to regulated investment companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this part (other than subsection (c) of this section) shall not be applicable to a regulated investment company for a taxable year unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the deduction for dividends paid during the taxable year (as defined in section 561, but without regard to capital gain dividends) equals or exceeds the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 90 percent of its investment company taxable income for the taxable year determined without regard to subsection (b)(2)(D); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 90 percent of the excess of (i) its interest income excludable from gross income under section 103(a) over (ii) its deductions disallowed under sections 265, 171(a)(2), and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the provisions of this part applied to the investment company for all taxable years ending on or after November 8, 1983, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as of the close of the taxable year, the investment company has no earnings and profits accumulated in any taxable year to which the provisions of this part (or the corresponding provisions of prior law) did not apply to it.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary may waive the requirements of paragraph (1) for any taxable year if the regulated investment company establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it was unable to meet such requirements by reason of distributions previously made to meet the requirements of section 4982.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of taxation of companies and shareholders</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Imposition of tax on regulated investment companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There is hereby imposed for each taxable year upon the investment company taxable in<!-- PDFPage:1368 -->come of every regulated investment company a tax computed as provided in section 11, as though the investment company taxable income were the taxable income referred to in section 11. In the case of a regulated investment company which is a personal holding company (as defined in section 542) or which fails to comply for the taxable year with regulations prescribed by the Secretary for the purpose of ascertaining the actual ownership of its stock, such tax shall be computed at the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Investment company taxable income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The investment company taxable income shall be the taxable income of the regulated investment company adjusted as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) There shall be excluded the amount of the net capital gain, if any.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The net operating loss deduction provided in section 172 shall not be allowed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The deductions for corporations provided in part VIII (except section 248) in subchapter B (section 241 and following, relating to the deduction for dividends received, etc.) shall not be allowed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#852_1_target" name="852_1">1</a></sup> deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) shall be allowed, but shall be computed without regard to capital gain dividends and exempt-interest dividends.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The taxable income shall be computed without regard to section 443(b) (relating to computation of tax on change of annual accounting period).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) The taxable income shall be computed without regard to section 454(b) (relating to short-term obligations issued on a discount basis) if the company so elects in a manner prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Capital gains</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Imposition of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">There is hereby imposed for each taxable year in the case of every regulated investment company a tax, determined as provided in section 1201(a), on the excess, if any, of the net capital gain over the deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) determined with reference to capital gain dividends only.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of capital gain dividends by shareholders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A capital gain dividend shall be treated by the shareholders as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 1 year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Definition of capital gain dividend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this part, a capital gain dividend is any dividend, or part thereof, which is designated by the company as a capital gain dividend in a written notice mailed to its shareholders not later than 60 days after the close of its taxable year; except that, if there is an increase in the excess described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for such year which results from a determination (as defined in section 860(e)), such designation may be made with respect to such increase at any time before the expiration of 120 days after the date of such determination. If the aggregate amount so designated with respect to a taxable year of the company (including capital gains dividends paid after the close of the taxable year described in section 855) is greater than the net capital gain of the taxable year, the portion of each distribution which shall be a capital gain dividend shall be only that proportion of the amount so designated which such net capital gain bears to the aggregate amount so designated. For purposes of this subparagraph, the amount of the net capital gain for a taxable year (to which an election under section 4982(e)(4) does not apply) shall be determined without regard to any net capital loss or net long-term capital loss attributable to transactions after October 31 of such year, and any such net capital loss or net long-term capital loss shall be treated as arising on the 1st day of the next taxable year. To the extent provided in regulations, the preceding sentence shall apply also for purposes of computing the taxable income of the regulated investment company.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Treatment by shareholders of undistributed capital gains</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Every shareholder of a regulated investment company at the close of the company's taxable year shall include, in computing his long-term capital gains in his return for his taxable year in which the last day of the company's taxable year falls, such amount as the company shall designate in respect of such shares in a written notice mailed to its shareholders at any time prior to the expiration of 60 days after close of its taxable year, but the amount so includible by any shareholder shall not exceed that part of the amount subjected to tax in subparagraph (A) which he would have received if all of such amount had been distributed as capital gain dividends by the company to the holders of such shares at the close of its taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For purposes of this title, every such shareholder shall be deemed to have paid, for his taxable year under clause (i), the tax imposed by subparagraph (A) on the amounts required by this subparagraph to be included in respect of such shares in computing his long-term capital gains for that year; and such shareholder shall be allowed credit or refund, as the case may be, for the tax so deemed to have been paid by him.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The adjusted basis of such shares in the hands of the shareholder shall be increased, with respect to the amounts required by this subparagraph to be included in computing his long-term capital gains, by the difference between the amount of such includible gains and the tax deemed paid by such shareholder in respect of such shares under clause (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) In the event of such designation the tax imposed by subparagraph (A) shall be paid by the regulated investment company within 30 days after close of its taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) The earnings and profits of such regulated investment company, and the earnings <!-- PDFPage:1369 -->and profits of any such shareholder which is a corporation, shall be appropriately adjusted in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Loss on sale or exchange of stock held 6 months or less</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Loss attributable to capital gain dividend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) subparagraph (B) or (D) of paragraph (3) provides that any amount with respect to any share is to be treated as long-term capital gain, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such share is held by the taxpayer for 6 months or less,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then any loss (to the extent not disallowed under subparagraph (B)) on the sale or exchange of such share shall, to the extent of the amount described in clause (i), be treated as a long-term capital loss.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Loss attributable to exempt-interest dividend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a shareholder of a regulated investment company receives an exempt-interest dividend with respect to any share, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such share is held by the taxpayer for 6 months or less,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then any loss on the sale or exchange of such share shall, to the extent of the amount of such exempt-interest dividend, be disallowed.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Determination of holding periods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the rules of paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 246(c) shall apply in determining the period for which the taxpayer has held any share of stock; except that &ldquo;6 months&rdquo; shall be substituted for each number of days specified in subparagraph (B)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#852_2_target" name="852_2">2</a></sup> of section 246(c)(3).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Losses incurred under a periodic liquidation plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent provided in regulations, subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply to losses incurred on the sale or exchange of shares of stock in a regulated investment company pursuant to a plan which provides for the periodic liquidation of such shares.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Authority to shorten required holding period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a regulated investment company which regularly distributes at least 90 percent of its net tax-exempt interest, the Secretary may by regulations prescribe that subparagraph (B) (and subparagraph (C) to the extent it relates to subparagraph (B)) shall be applied on the basis of a holding period requirement shorter than 6 months; except that such shorter holding period requirement shall not be shorter than the greater of 31 days or the period between regular distributions of exempt-interest dividends.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Exempt-interest dividends</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, at the close of each quarter of its taxable year, at least 50 percent of the value (as defined in section 851(c)(4)) of the total assets of the regulated investment company consists of obligations described in section 103(a), such company shall be qualified to pay exempt-interest dividends, as defined herein, to its shareholders.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An exempt-interest dividend means any dividend or part thereof (other than a capital gain dividend) paid by a regulated investment company and designated by it as an exempt-interest dividend in a written notice mailed to its shareholders not later than 60 days after the close of its taxable year. If the aggregate amount so designated with respect to a taxable year of the company (including exempt-interest dividends paid after the close of the taxable year as described in section 855) is greater than the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount of interest excludable from gross income under section 103(a), over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amounts disallowed as deductions under sections 265 and 171(a)(2),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the portion of such distribution which shall constitute an exempt-interest dividend shall be only that proportion of the amount so designated as the amount of such excess for such taxable year bears to the amount so designated.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of exempt-interest dividends by shareholders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An exempt-interest dividend shall be treated by the shareholders for all purposes of this subtitle as an item of interest excludable from gross income under section 103(a). Such purposes include but are not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the determination of gross income and taxable income,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the determination of distributable net income under subchapter J,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the allowance of, or calculation of the amount of, any credit or deduction, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the determination of the basis in the hands of any shareholder of any share of stock of the company.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Section 311(b) not to apply to certain distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Section 311(b) shall not apply to any distribution by a regulated investment company to which this part applies, if such distribution is in redemption of its stock upon the demand of the shareholder.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Time certain dividends taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this title, any dividend declared by a regulated investment company in October, November, or December of any calendar year and payable to shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month shall be deemed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to have been received by each shareholder on December 31 of such calendar year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to have been paid by such company on December 31 of such calendar year (or, if earlier, as provided in section 855).</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares, or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) which (but for the provisions of this part) would be taxable as a domestic corporation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) which is neither (A) a financial institution referred to in section 582(c)(2), nor (B) an insurance company to which subchapter L applies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) subject to the provisions of subsection (k), which is not closely held (as determined under subsection (h)); and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A corporation, trust, or association shall not be considered a real estate investment trust for any taxable year unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it files with its return for the taxable year an election to be a real estate investment trust or has made such election for a previous taxable year, and such election has not been terminated or revoked under subsection (g);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) at least 95 percent (90 percent for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1980) of its gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) is derived from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) dividends;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) rents from real property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) gain from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities, and real property (including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property) which is not property described in section 1221(1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) abatements and refunds of taxes on real property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) income and gain derived from foreclosure property (as defined in subsection (e));</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) gain from the sale or other disposition of a real estate asset which is not a prohibited transaction solely by reason of section 857(b)(6);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) at least 75 percent of its gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) is derived from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) rents from real property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) gain from the sale or other disposition of a real estate asset which is not a prohibited transaction solely by reason of section 857(b)(6); and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1380 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) qualified temporary investment income; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) at the close of each quarter of the taxable year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) at least 75 percent of the value of its total assets is represented by real estate assets, cash and cash items (including receivables), and Government securities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not more than 25 percent of the value of its total assets is represented by securities (other than those includible under subparagraph (A)) for purposes of this calculation limited in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater in value than 5 percent of the value of the total assets of the trust and to not more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A real estate investment trust which meets the requirements of this paragraph at the close of any quarter shall not lose its status as a real estate investment trust because of a discrepancy during a subsequent quarter between the value of its various investments and such requirements unless such discrepancy exists immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property and is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition. A real estate investment trust which does not meet such requirements at the close of any quarter by reason of a discrepancy existing immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property which is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition during such quarter shall not lose its status for such quarter as a real estate investment trust if such discrepancy is eliminated within 30 days after the close of such quarter and in such cases it shall be considered to have met such requirements at the close of such quarter for purposes of applying the preceding sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) For purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The term &ldquo;value&rdquo; means, with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such securities; and with respect to other securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith by the trustees, except that in the case of securities of real estate investment trusts such fair value shall not exceed market value or asset value, whichever is higher.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The term &ldquo;real estate assets&rdquo; means real property (including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property) and shares (or transferable certificates of beneficial interest) in other real estate investment trusts which meet the requirements of this part. Such term also includes any property (not otherwise a real estate asset) attributable to the temporary investment of new capital, but only if such property is stock or a debt instrument, and only for the 1-year period beginning on the date the real estate trust receives such capital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The term &ldquo;interests in real property&rdquo; includes fee ownership and co-ownership of land or improvements thereon, leaseholds of land or improvements thereon, options to acquire land or improvements thereon, and options to acquire leaseholds of land or improvements thereon, but does not include mineral, oil, or gas royalty interests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Qualified temporary investment income.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;qualified temporary investment income&rdquo; means any income which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is attributable to stock or a debt instrument (within the meaning of section 1275(a)(1)),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) is attributable to the temporary investment of new capital, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) is received or accrued during the 1-year period beginning on the date on which the real estate investment trust receives such capital.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>New capital</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;new capital&rdquo; means any amount received by the real estate investment trust&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) in exchange for stock (or certificates of beneficial interests) in such trust (other than amounts received pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) in a public offering of debt obligations of such trust which have maturities of at least 5 years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) A regular or residual interest in a REMIC shall be treated as a real estate asset, and any amount includible in gross income with respect to such an interest shall be treated as interest on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property; except that, if less than 95 percent of the assets of such REMIC are real estate assets (determined as if the real estate investment trust held such assets), such real estate investment trust shall be treated as holding directly (and as receiving directly) its proportionate share of the assets and income of the REMIC. For purposes of determining whether any interest in a REMIC qualifies under the preceding sentence, any interest held by such REMIC in another REMIC shall be treated as a real estate asset under principles similar to the principles of the preceding sentence, except that, if such REMIC's are part of a tiered structure, they shall be treated as one REMIC for purposes of this subparagraph. The principles of the preceding provisions of this subparagraph shall apply to regular interests in a FASIT.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) All other terms shall have the same meaning as when used in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;1 and following).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) <cap-smallcap>Treatment of certain hedging instruments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except to the extent provided by regulations, any&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) payment to a real estate investment trust under an interest rate swap or cap agreement, option, futures contract, forward rate agreement, or any similar financial instrument, entered into by the trust in a transaction to reduce the interest rate risks with respect to any indebtedness incurred or to be incurred by the trust to acquire or carry real estate assets, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) gain from the sale or other disposition of any such investment,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1381 --><p class="statutory-body-block-2em">shall be treated as income qualifying under paragraph (2).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A corporation, trust, or association which fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3), or of both such paragraphs, for any taxable year shall nevertheless be considered to have satisfied the requirements of such paragraphs for such taxable year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the nature and amount of each item of its gross income described in such paragraphs is set forth in a schedule attached to its income tax return for such taxable year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the inclusion of any incorrect information in the schedule referred to in subparagraph (A) is not due to fraud with intent to evade tax; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the failure to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3), or of both such paragraphs, is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rents from real property defined</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amounts included</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (c), the term &ldquo;rents from real property&rdquo; includes (subject to paragraph (2))&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (C), with respect to each lease of real property, rent attributable to personal property for the taxable year is that amount which bears the same ratio to total rent for the taxable year as the average of the adjusted bases of the personal property at the beginning and at the end of the taxable year bears to the average of the aggregate adjusted bases of both the real property and the personal property at the beginning and at the end of such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amounts excluded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (c), the term &ldquo;rents from real property&rdquo; does not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) except as provided in paragraphs (4) and (6), any amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, with respect to any real or personal property, if the determination of such amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits derived by any person from such property (except that any amount so received or accrued shall not be excluded from the term &ldquo;rents from real property&rdquo; solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any amount received or accrued directly or indirectly from any person if the real estate investment trust owns, directly or indirectly&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of any person which is a corporation, stock of such person possessing 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or 10 percent or more of the total number of shares of all classes of stock of such person; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of any person which is not a corporation, an interest of 10 percent or more in the assets or net profits of such person; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Independent contractor defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection and subsection (e), the term &ldquo;independent contractor&rdquo; means any person&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirements applicable to real estate investment trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this part (other than subsection (d) of this section and subsection (g) of section 856) shall not apply to a real estate investment trust for a taxable year unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the deduction for dividends paid during the taxable year (as defined in section 561, but determined without regard to capital gains dividends) equals or exceeds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 95 percent (90 percent for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1980) of the real estate investment trust taxable income for the taxable year (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) and by excluding any net capital gain); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 95 percent (90 percent for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1980) of the excess of the net income from foreclosure property over the tax imposed on such income by subsection (b)(4)(A); minus</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any excess noncash income (as determined under subsection (e)); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the provisions of this part apply to the real estate investment trust for all taxable years beginning after February 28, 1986, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as of the close of the taxable year, the real estate investment trust has no earnings and profits accumulated in any non-REIT year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;non-REIT year&rdquo; means any taxable year to which the provisions of this part did not apply with respect to the entity. The Secretary may waive the requirements of paragraph (1) for any taxable year if the real estate investment trust establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it was unable to meet such requirements by reason of distributions previously made to meet the requirements of section 4981.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of taxation of real estate investment trusts and holders of shares or certificates of beneficial interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Imposition of tax on real estate investment trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the real estate investment trust taxable income of every real estate investment trust a tax computed as provided in section 11, as though the real estate investment trust taxable income were the taxable income referred to in section 11.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Real estate investment trust taxable income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;real estate investment trust taxable income&rdquo; means <!-- PDFPage:1390 -->the taxable income of the real estate investment trust, adjusted as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The deductions for corporations provided in part VIII (except section 248) of subchapter B (section 241 and following, relating to the deduction for dividends received, etc.) shall not be allowed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) shall be allowed, but shall be computed without regard to that portion of such deduction which is attributable to the amount excluded under subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The taxable income shall be computed without regard to section 443(b) (relating to computation of tax on change of annual accounting period).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) There shall be excluded an amount equal to the net income from foreclosure property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) There shall be deducted an amount equal to the tax imposed by paragraph (5) for the taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) There shall be excluded an amount equal to any net income derived from prohibited transactions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Capital gains</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Alternative tax in case of capital gains</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If for any taxable year a real estate investment trust has a net capital gain, then, in lieu of the tax imposed by subsection (b)(1), there is hereby imposed a tax (if such tax is less than the tax imposed by such subsection) which shall consist of the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a tax, computed as provided in subsection (b)(1), on the real estate investment trust taxable income (determined by excluding such net capital gain and by computing the deduction for dividends paid without regard to capital gain dividends), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a tax determined at the rate provided in section 1201(a) on the excess of the net capital gain over the deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) determined with reference to capital gains dividends only.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of capital gain dividends by shareholders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A capital gain dividend shall be treated by the shareholders or holders of beneficial interests as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 1 year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Definition of capital gain dividend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this part, a capital gain dividend is any dividend, or part thereof, which is designated by the real estate investment trust as a capital gain dividend in a written notice mailed to its shareholders or holders of beneficial interests at any time before the expiration of 30 days after the close of its taxable year (or mailed to its shareholders or holders of beneficial interests with its annual report for the taxable year); except that, if there is an increase in the excess described in subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph for such year which results from a determination (as defined in section 860(e)), such designation may be made with respect to such increase at any time before the expiration of 120 days after the date of such determination. If the aggregate amount so designated with respect to a taxable year of the trust (including capital gain dividends paid after the close of the taxable year described in section 858) is greater than the net capital gain of the taxable year, the portion of each distribution which shall be a capital gain dividend shall be only that proportion of the amount so designated which such net capital gain bears to the aggregate amount so designated. For purposes of this subparagraph, the amount of the net capital gain for any taxable year which is not a calendar year shall be determined without regard to any net capital loss attributable to transactions after December 31 of such year, and any such net capital loss shall be treated as arising on the 1st day of the next taxable year. To the extent provided in regulations, the preceding sentence shall apply also for purposes of computing the taxable income of the real estate investment trust.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Treatment by shareholders of undistributed capital gains</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Every shareholder of a real estate investment trust at the close of the trust's taxable year shall include, in computing his long-term capital gains in his return for his taxable year in which the last day of the trust's taxable year falls, such amount as the trust shall designate in respect of such shares in a written notice mailed to its shareholders at any time prior to the expiration of 60 days after the close of its taxable year (or mailed to its shareholders or holders of beneficial interests with its annual report for the taxable year), but the amount so includible by any shareholder shall not exceed that part of the amount subjected to tax in subparagraph (A)(ii) which he would have received if all of such amount had been distributed as capital gain dividends by the trust to the holders of such shares at the close of its taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For purposes of this title, every such shareholder shall be deemed to have paid, for his taxable year under clause (i), the tax imposed by subparagraph (A)(ii) on the amounts required by this subparagraph to be included in respect of such shares in computing his long-term capital gains for that year; and such shareholders shall be allowed credit or refund as the case may be, for the tax so deemed to have been paid by him.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The adjusted basis of such shares in the hands of the holder shall be increased with respect to the amounts required by this subparagraph to be included in computing his long-term capital gains, by the difference between the amount of such includible gains and the tax deemed paid by such shareholder in respect of such shares under clause (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) In the event of such designation, the tax imposed by subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be paid by the real estate investment trust within 30 days after the close of its taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) The earnings and profits of such real estate investment trust, and the earnings <!-- PDFPage:1391 -->and profits of any such shareholder which is a corporation, shall be appropriately adjusted in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) As used in this subparagraph, the terms &ldquo;shares&rdquo; and &ldquo;shareholders&rdquo; shall include beneficial interests and holders of beneficial interests, respectively.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Coordination with net operating loss provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of section 172, if a real estate investment trust pays capital gain dividends during any taxable year, the amount of the net capital gain for such taxable year (to the extent such gain does not exceed the amount of such capital gain dividends) shall be excluded in determining&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the net operating loss for the taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of the net operating loss of any prior taxable year which may be carried through such taxable year under section 172(b)(2) to a succeeding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Income from foreclosure property</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Imposition of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A tax is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the net income from foreclosure property of every real estate investment trust. Such tax shall be computed by multiplying the net income from foreclosure property by the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Net income from foreclosure property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;net income from foreclosure property&rdquo; means the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) gain from the sale or other disposition of foreclosure property described in section 1221(1) and the gross income for the taxable year derived from foreclosure property (as defined in section 856(e)), but only to the extent such gross income is not described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), or (G) of section 856(c)(3), over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the production of the income referred to in clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Imposition of tax in case of failure to meet certain requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If section 856(c)(6) applies to a real estate investment trust for any taxable year, there is hereby imposed on such trust a tax in an amount equal to the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 95 percent (90 percent in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 1980) of the gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) of the real estate investment trust, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of such gross income which is derived from sources referred to in section 856(c)(2); or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 75 percent of the gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) of the real estate investment trust, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of such gross income which is derived from sources referred to in section 856(c)(3),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the real estate investment trust taxable income for the taxable year (determined without regard to the deductions provided in paragraphs (2)(B) and (2)(E), without regard to any net operating loss deduction, and by excluding any net capital gain) and the denominator of which is the gross income for the taxable year (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions; gross income and gain from foreclosure property (as defined in section 856(e), but only to the extent such gross income and gain is not described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), or (G) of section 856(c)(3)); long-term capital gain; and short-term capital gain to the extent of any short-term capital loss).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the term &ldquo;net income derived from prohibited transactions&rdquo; means the excess of the gain from prohibited transactions over the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with prohibited transactions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in determining the amount of the net income derived from prohibited transactions, there shall not be taken into account any item attributable to any prohibited transaction for which there was a loss; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the term &ldquo;prohibited transaction&rdquo; means a sale or other disposition of property described in section 1221(1) which is not foreclosure property.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Certain sales not to constitute prohibited transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;prohibited transaction&rdquo; does not include a sale of property which is a real estate asset as defined in section 856(c)(5)(B) if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) aggregate expenditures made by the trust, or any partner of the trust, during the 4-year period preceding the date of sale which are includible in the basis of the property do not exceed 30 percent of the net selling price of the property;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In applying subparagraph (C) the following special rules apply:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The holding period of property acquired through foreclosure (or deed in lieu of foreclosure), or termination of the lease, includes the period for which the trust held the loan which such property secured, or the lease of such property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) In the case of a property acquired through foreclosure (or deed in lieu of foreclosure), or termination of a lease, expenditures made by, or for the account of, the mortgagor or lessee after default became imminent will be regarded as made by the trust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Expenditures (including expenditures regarded as made directly by the trust, or indirectly by any partner of the trust, under clause (ii)) will not be taken into account if they relate to foreclosure property and did not cause the property to lose its status as foreclosure property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Expenditures will not be taken into account if they are made solely to comply with standards or requirements of any government or governmental authority having relevant jurisdiction, or if they are made to restore the property as a result of losses arising from fire, storm or other casualty.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a determination with respect to any qualified investment entity results in any adjustment for any taxable year, a deduction shall be allowed to such entity for the amount of deficiency dividends for purposes of determining the deduction for dividends paid (for purposes of section 852 or 857, whichever applies) for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Qualified investment entity defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;qualified investment entity&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the tax imposed by this chapter (after taking into account the deduction allowed by subsection (a)) on the qualified investment entity for the taxable year with respect to which the determination is made shall be deemed to be increased by an amount equal to the deduction allowed by subsection (a) with respect to such taxable year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the last date prescribed for payment of such increase in tax shall be deemed to have been the last date prescribed for the payment of tax (determined in the manner provided by section 6601(b)) for the taxable year with respect to which the determination is made, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such increase in tax shall be deemed to be paid as of the date the claim for the deficiency dividend deduction is filed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Credit or refund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the allowance of a deficiency dividend deduction results in an overpayment of tax for any taxable year, credit or refund with respect to such overpayment shall be made as if on the date of the determination 2 years remained before the expiration of the period of limitations on the filing of claim for refund for the taxable year to which the overpayment relates.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;deficiency dividends&rdquo; means a distribution of property made by the qualified investment entity on or after the date of the determination and before filing claim under subsection (g), which would have been includible in the computation of the deduction for dividends paid under section 561 for the taxable year with respect to which the liability for tax resulting from the determination exists if distributed during such taxable year. No distribution of property shall be considered as deficiency dividends for purposes of subsection (a) unless distributed within 90 days after the determination, and unless a claim for a deficiency dividend deduction with respect to such distribution is filed pursuant to subsection (g).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Ordinary dividends</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect on dividends paid deduction</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) For taxable year in which paid</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Deficiency dividends paid in any taxable year shall not be included in the amount of dividends paid for such year for purposes of computing the dividends paid deduction for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) For prior taxable year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Deficiency dividends paid in any taxable year shall not be allowed for purposes of section 855(a) or 858(a) in the computation of the dividends paid deduction for the taxable year preceding the taxable year in which paid.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Stay of collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any deficiency established by a determination under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the collection of the deficiency, and all interest, additions to tax, additional amounts, and assessable penalties in respect thereof, shall, except in cases of jeopardy, be stayed until the expiration of 120 days after the date of the determination, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if claim for a deficiency dividend deduction is filed under subsection (g), the collection of such part of the deficiency as is not reduced by the deduction for deficiency dividends provided in subsection (a) shall be stayed until the date the claim is disallowed (in whole or in part), and if disallowed in part collection shall be made only with respect to the part disallowed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">No distraint or proceeding in court shall be begun for the collection of an amount the col<!-- PDFPage:1400 -->lection of which is stayed under subparagraph (A) or (B) during the period for which the collection of such amount is stayed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Deduction denied in case of fraud</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No deficiency dividend deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) if the determination contains a finding that any part of any deficiency attributable to an adjustment with respect to the taxable year is due to fraud with intent to evade tax or to willfull&nbsp;<sup><a href="#860_2_target" name="860_2">2</a></sup> failure to file an income tax return within the time prescribed by law or prescribed by the Secretary in pursuance of law.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Daily portion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The daily portion referred to in paragraph (1) shall be determined&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Regular interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;regular interest&rdquo; means any interest in a REMIC which is issued on the startup day with fixed terms and which is designated as a regular interest if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such interest unconditionally entitles the holder to receive a specified principal amount (or other similar amount), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) interest payments (or other similar amount), if any, with respect to such interest at or before maturity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) are payable based on a fixed rate (or to the extent provided in regulations, at a variable rate), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) consist of a specified portion of the interest payments on qualified mortgages and such portion does not vary during the period such interest is outstanding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The interest shall not fail to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) merely because the timing (but not the amount) of the principal payments (or other similar amounts) may be contingent on the extent of prepayments on qualified mortgages and the amount of income from permitted investments.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Residual interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;residual interest&rdquo; means an interest in a REMIC which is issued on the startup day, which is not a regular interest, and which is designated as a residual interest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is purchased by the REMIC within the 3-month period beginning on the startup day if, except as provided in regulations, such purchase is pursuant to a fixed-price contract in effect on the startup day,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any qualified replacement mortgage,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any regular interest in another REMIC transferred to the REMIC on the startup day in exchange for regular or residual interests in the REMIC, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any regular interest in a FASIT which is transferred to, or purchased by, the REMIC as described in clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A) but only if 95 percent or more of the value of the assets of such FASIT is at all times attributable to obligations described in subparagraph (A) (without regard to such clauses).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), any obligation secured by stock held by a person as a tenant-stockholder (as defined in section 216) in a cooperative housing corporation (as so defined) shall be treated as secured by an interest in real property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Qualified replacement mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;qualified replacement mortgage&rdquo; means any obligation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which would be a qualified mortgage if transferred on the startup day in exchange for regular or residual interests in the REMIC, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which is received for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) another obligation within the 3-month period beginning on the startup day, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a defective obligation within the 2-year period beginning on the startup day.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1408 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Permitted investments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;permitted investments&rdquo; means any&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) cash flow investment,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) qualified reserve asset, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) foreclosure property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Cash flow investment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;cash flow investment&rdquo; means any investment of amounts received under qualified mortgages for a temporary period before distribution to holders of interests in the REMIC.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Qualified reserve asset</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;qualified reserve asset&rdquo; means any intangible property which is held for investment and as part of a qualified reserve fund.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Qualified reserve fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;qualified reserve fund&rdquo; means any reasonably required reserve to provide for full payment of expenses of the REMIC or amounts due on regular interests in the event of defaults on qualified mortgages or lower than expected returns on cash flow investments. The amount of any such reserve shall be promptly and appropriately reduced as payments of qualified mortgages are received.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A reserve shall not be treated as a qualified reserve for any taxable year (and all subsequent taxable years) if more than 30 percent of the gross income from the assets in such fund for the taxable year is derived from the sale or other disposition of property held for less than 3 months. For purposes of the preceding sentence, gain on the disposition of a qualified reserve asset shall not be taken into account if the disposition giving rise to such gain is required to prevent default on a regular interest where the threatened default resulted from a default on 1 or more qualified mortgages.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Foreclosure property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;foreclosure property&rdquo; means property&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which would be foreclosure property under section 856(e) (without regard to paragraph (5) thereof) if acquired by a real estate investment trust, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which is acquired in connection with the default or imminent default of a qualified mortgage held by the REMIC.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Solely for purposes of section 860D(a), the determination of whether any property is foreclosure property shall be made without regard to section 856(e)(4).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Startup day</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;startup day&rdquo; means the day on which the REMIC issues all of its regular and residual interests. To the extent provided in regulations, all interests issued (and all transfers to the REMIC) during any period (not exceeding 10 days) permitted in such regulations shall be treated as occurring on the day during such period selected by the REMIC for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Issue price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The issue price of any regular or residual interest in a REMIC shall be determined under section 1273(b) in the same manner as if such interest were a debt instrument; except that if the interest is issued for property, paragraph (3) of section 1273(b) shall apply whether or not the requirements of such paragraph are met.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Treatment of nonresident aliens and foreign corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the holder of a residual interest in a REMIC is a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation, for purposes of sections 871(a), 881, 1441, and 1442&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) amounts includible in the gross income of such holder under this part shall be taken into account when paid or distributed (or when the interest is disposed of), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) no exemption from the taxes imposed by such sections (and no reduction in the rates of such taxes) shall apply to any excess inclusion.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary may by regulations provide that such amounts shall be taken into account earlier than as provided in paragraph (1) where necessary or appropriate to prevent the avoidance of tax imposed by this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Tax on income from foreclosure property</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A tax is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the net income from foreclosure property of each REMIC. Such tax shall be computed by multiplying the net income from foreclosure property by the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Net income from foreclosure property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;net income from foreclosure property&rdquo; means the amount which would be the REMIC's net income from foreclosure property under section 857(b)(4)(B) if the REMIC were a real estate investment trust.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Tax on contributions after startup date</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), if any amount is contributed to a REMIC after the startup day, there is hereby imposed a tax for the taxable year of the REMIC in which the contribution is received equal to 100 percent of the amount of such contribution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any contribution which is made in cash and is described in any of the following subparagraphs:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Any contribution to facilitate a clean-up call (as defined in regulations) or a qualified liquidation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Any payment in the nature of a guarantee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Any contribution during the 3-month period beginning on the startup day.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Any contribution to a qualified reserve fund by any holder of a residual interest in the REMIC.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1409 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Any other contribution permitted in regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this part, including regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to prevent unreasonable accumulations of assets in a REMIC,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) permitting determinations of the fair market value of property transferred to a REMIC and issue price of interests in a REMIC to be made earlier than otherwise provided,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) requiring reporting to holders of residual interests of such information as frequently as is necessary or appropriate to permit such holders to compute their taxable income accurately,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) providing appropriate rules for treatment of transfers of qualified replacement mortgages to the REMIC where the transferor holds any interest in the REMIC, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) providing that a mortgage will be treated as a qualified replacement mortgage only if it is part of a bona fide replacement (and not part of a swap of mortgages).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If property is sold or contributed to a FASIT by the holder of the ownership interest in such FASIT (or by a related person) gain (if any) shall be recognized to such holder (or person) in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of such property's value under subsection (d) on the date of such sale or contribution over its adjusted basis on such date.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Property acquired other than from holder of ownership interest or related person</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Property which is acquired by a FASIT other than in a transaction to which paragraph (1) applies shall be treated&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Gain recognition on property outside FASIT which supports regular interests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If property held by the holder of the ownership interest in a FASIT (or by any person related to such holder) supports any regular interest in such FASIT&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) gain shall be recognized to such holder (or person) in the same manner as if such holder (or person) had sold such property at its value under subsection (d) on the earliest date such property supports such an interest, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such property shall be treated as held by such FASIT for purposes of this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Deferral of gain recognition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may prescribe regulations which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provide that gain otherwise recognized under subsection (a) or (b) shall not be recognized before the earliest date on which such property supports any regular interest in such FASIT or any indebtedness of the holder of the ownership interest (or of any person related to such holder), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide such adjustments to the other provisions of this part to the extent appropriate in the context of the treatment provided under paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) each extension of credit (other than the accrual of interest) on a revolving loan account shall be treated as a separate debt instrument, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) payments on such extensions of credit having substantially the same terms shall be applied to such extensions beginning with the earliest such extension.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Nonrecognition rules not to apply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Gain required to be recognized under this section shall be recognized notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle.</p>
