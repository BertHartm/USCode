<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A corporation shall not be considered a regulated investment company for any taxable year unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it files with its return for the taxable year an election to be a regulated investment company or has made such election for a previous taxable year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) at least 90 percent of its gross income is derived from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans (as defined in sec<!-- PDFPage:1671 -->tion 512(a)(5)), and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities (as defined in section 2(a)(36) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended) or foreign currencies, or other income (including but not limited to gains from options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities, or currencies, and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not more than 25 percent of the value of its total assets is invested in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the securities (other than Government securities or the securities of other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer,</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of paragraph (2), there shall be treated as dividends amounts included in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A)(i) or 1293(a) for the taxable year to the extent that, under section 959(a)(1) or 1293(c) (as the case may be), there is a distribution out of the earnings and profits of the taxable year which are attributable to the amounts so included. For purposes of paragraph (2), the Secretary may by regulation exclude from qualifying income foreign currency gains which are not directly related to the company's principal business of investing in stock or securities (or options and futures with respect to stock or securities). For purposes of paragraph (2), amounts excludable from gross income under section 103(a) shall be treated as included in gross income. Income derived from a partnership (other than a qualified publicly traded partnership as defined in subsection (h)) or trust shall be treated as described in paragraph (2) only to the extent such income is attributable to items of income of the partnership or trust (as the case may be) which would be described in paragraph (2) if realized by the regulated investment company in the same manner as realized by the partnership or trust.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rules applicable to subsection (b)(3)</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The term &ldquo;outstanding voting securities of such issuer&rdquo; shall include the equity securities of a qualified publicly traded partnership (as defined in subsection (h)).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A corporation which meets the requirements of subsections (b)(3) and (c) at the close of any quarter shall not lose its status as a regulated investment company because of a discrepancy during a subsequent quarter between the value of its various investments and such requirements unless such discrepancy exists immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property and is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition. A corporation which does not meet such requirements at the close of any quarter by reason of a discrepancy existing immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property which is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition during such quarter shall not lose its status for such quarter as a regulated investment company if such discrepancy is eliminated within 30 days after the close of such quarter and in such cases it shall be considered to have met such requirements at the close of such quarter for purposes of applying the preceding sentence.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1672 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Investment companies furnishing capital to development corporations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Securities and Exchange Commission determines, in accordance with regulations issued by it, and certifies to the Secretary not earlier than 60 days prior to the close of the taxable year of a management company or a business development company described in subsection (a)(1), that such investment company is principally engaged in the furnishing of capital to other corporations which are principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions, technological improvements, new processes, or products not previously generally available, such investment company may, in the computation of 50 percent of the value of its assets under subparagraph (A) of subsection (b)(3) for any quarter of such taxable year, include the value of any securities of an issuer, whether or not the investment company owns more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, the basis of which, when added to the basis of the investment company for securities of such issuer previously acquired, did not exceed 5 percent of the value of the total assets of the investment company at the time of the subsequent acquisition of securities. The preceding sentence shall not apply to the securities of an issuer if the investment company has continuously held any security of such issuer (or of any predecessor company of such issuer as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) for 10 or more years preceding such quarter of such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of this subsection shall not apply at the close of any quarter of a taxable year to an investment company if at the close of such quarter more than 25 percent of the value of its total assets is represented by securities of issuers with respect to each of which the investment company holds more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and in respect of each of which or any predecessor thereof the investment company has continuously held any security for 10 or more years preceding such quarter unless the value of its total assets so represented is reduced to 25 percent or less within 30 days after the close of such quarter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determination of status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, unless the Securities and Exchange Commission determines otherwise, a corporation shall be considered to be principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions, technological improvements, new processes, or products not previously generally available, for at least 10 years after the date of the first acquisition of any security in such corporation or any predecessor thereof by such investment company if at the date of such acquisition the corporation or its predecessor was principally so engaged, and an investment company shall be considered at any date to be furnishing capital to any company whose securities it holds if within 10 years prior to such date it has acquired any of such securities, or any securities surrendered in exchange therefor, from such other company or predecessor thereof. For purposes of the certification under this subsection, the Securities and Exchange Commission shall have authority to issue such rules, regulations and orders, and to conduct such investigations and hearings, either public or private, as it may deem appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The terms used in this subsection shall have the same meaning as in subsections (b)(3) and (c) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this title&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall not be treated as a person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In the case of a unit investment trust described in paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) each holder of an interest in such trust shall, to the extent of such interest, be treated as owning a proportionate share of the assets of such trust;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the basis of the assets of such trust which are treated under subparagraph (A) as being owned by a holder of an interest in such trust shall be the same as the basis of his interest in such trust; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in determining the period for which the holder of an interest in such trust has held the assets of the trust which are treated under subparagraph (A) as being owned by him, there shall be included the period for which such holder has held his interest in such trust.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a regulated investment company (within the meaning of subsection (a)) having more than one fund, each fund of such regulated investment company shall be treated as a separate corporation for purposes of this title (except with respect to the definitional requirement of subsection (a)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Fund defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1) the term &ldquo;fund&rdquo; means a segregated portfolio of assets, <!-- PDFPage:1673 -->the beneficial interests in which are owned by the holders of a class or series of stock of the regulated investment company that is preferred over all other classes or series in respect of such portfolio of assets.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirements applicable to regulated investment companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this part (other than subsection (c) of this section) shall not be applicable to a regulated investment company for a taxable year unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the deduction for dividends paid during the taxable year (as defined in section 561, but without regard to capital gain dividends) equals or exceeds the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 90 percent of its investment company taxable income for the taxable year determined without regard to subsection (b)(2)(D); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 90 percent of the excess of (i) its interest income excludable from gross income under section 103(a) over (ii) its deductions disallowed under sections 265, 171(a)(2), and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the provisions of this part applied to the investment company for all taxable years ending on or after November 8, 1983, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as of the close of the taxable year, the investment company has no earnings and profits accumulated in any taxable year to which the provisions of this part (or the corresponding provisions of prior law) did not apply to it.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary may waive the requirements of paragraph (1) for any taxable year if the regulated investment company establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it was unable to meet such requirements by reason of distributions previously made to meet the requirements of section 4982.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of taxation of companies and shareholders</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Imposition of tax on regulated investment companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There is hereby imposed for each taxable year upon the investment company taxable income of every regulated investment company a tax computed as provided in section 11, as though the investment company taxable income were the taxable income referred to in section 11. In the case of a regulated investment company which is a personal holding company (as defined in section 542) or which fails to comply for the taxable year with regulations prescribed by the Secretary for the purpose of ascertaining the actual ownership of its stock, such tax shall be computed at the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Investment company taxable income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The investment company taxable income shall be the taxable income of the regulated investment company adjusted as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) There shall be excluded the amount of the net capital gain, if any.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The net operating loss deduction provided in section 172 shall not be allowed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The deductions for corporations provided in part VIII (except section 248) in subchapter B (section 241 and following, relating to the deduction for dividends received, etc.) shall not be allowed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#852_1_target" name="852_1">1</a></sup> deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) shall be allowed, but shall be computed without regard to capital gain dividends and exempt-interest dividends.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The taxable income shall be computed without regard to section 443(b) (relating to computation of tax on change of annual accounting period).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) The taxable income shall be computed without regard to section 454(b) (relating to short-term obligations issued on a discount basis) if the company so elects in a manner prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Capital gains</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Imposition of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">There is hereby imposed for each taxable year in the case of every regulated investment company a tax, determined as provided in section 1201(a), on the excess, if any, of the net capital gain over the deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) determined with reference to capital gain dividends only.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of capital gain dividends by shareholders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A capital gain dividend shall be treated by the shareholders as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 1 year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Definition of capital gain dividend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this part, a capital gain dividend is any dividend, or part thereof, which is designated by the company as a capital gain dividend in a written notice mailed to its shareholders not later than 60 days after the close of its taxable year; except that, if there is an increase in the excess described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for such year which results from a determination (as defined in section 860(e)), such designation may be made with respect to such increase at any time before the expiration of 120 days after the date of such de<!-- PDFPage:1676 -->termination. If the aggregate amount so designated with respect to a taxable year of the company (including capital gains dividends paid after the close of the taxable year described in section 855) is greater than the net capital gain of the taxable year, the portion of each distribution which shall be a capital gain dividend shall be only that proportion of the amount so designated which such net capital gain bears to the aggregate amount so designated. For purposes of this subparagraph, the amount of the net capital gain for a taxable year (to which an election under section 4982(e)(4) does not apply) shall be determined without regard to any net capital loss or net long-term capital loss attributable to transactions after October 31 of such year, and any such net capital loss or net long-term capital loss shall be treated as arising on the 1st day of the next taxable year. To the extent provided in regulations, the preceding sentence shall apply also for purposes of computing the taxable income of the regulated investment company.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Treatment by shareholders of undistributed capital gains</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Every shareholder of a regulated investment company at the close of the company's taxable year shall include, in computing his long-term capital gains in his return for his taxable year in which the last day of the company's taxable year falls, such amount as the company shall designate in respect of such shares in a written notice mailed to its shareholders at any time prior to the expiration of 60 days after close of its taxable year, but the amount so includible by any shareholder shall not exceed that part of the amount subjected to tax in subparagraph (A) which he would have received if all of such amount had been distributed as capital gain dividends by the company to the holders of such shares at the close of its taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For purposes of this title, every such shareholder shall be deemed to have paid, for his taxable year under clause (i), the tax imposed by subparagraph (A) on the amounts required by this subparagraph to be included in respect of such shares in computing his long-term capital gains for that year; and such shareholder shall be allowed credit or refund, as the case may be, for the tax so deemed to have been paid by him.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The adjusted basis of such shares in the hands of the shareholder shall be increased, with respect to the amounts required by this subparagraph to be included in computing his long-term capital gains, by the difference between the amount of such includible gains and the tax deemed paid by such shareholder in respect of such shares under clause (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) In the event of such designation the tax imposed by subparagraph (A) shall be paid by the regulated investment company within 30 days after close of its taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) The earnings and profits of such regulated investment company, and the earnings and profits of any such shareholder which is a corporation, shall be appropriately adjusted in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Certain distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a distribution to which section 897 does not apply by reason of the second sentence of section 897(h)(1), the amount of such distribution which would be included in computing long-term capital gains for the shareholder under subparagraph (B) or (D) (without regard to this subparagraph)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall not be included in computing such shareholder's long-term capital gains, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall be included in such shareholder's gross income as a dividend from the regulated investment company.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Loss on sale or exchange of stock held 6 months or less</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Loss attributable to capital gain dividend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) subparagraph (B) or (D) of paragraph (3) provides that any amount with respect to any share is to be treated as long-term capital gain, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such share is held by the taxpayer for 6 months or less,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then any loss (to the extent not disallowed under subparagraph (B)) on the sale or exchange of such share shall, to the extent of the amount described in clause (i), be treated as a long-term capital loss.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Loss attributable to exempt-interest dividend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a shareholder of a regulated investment company receives an exempt-interest dividend with respect to any share, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such share is held by the taxpayer for 6 months or less,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then any loss on the sale or exchange of such share shall, to the extent of the amount of such exempt-interest dividend, be disallowed.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Determination of holding periods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, in determining the period for which the taxpayer has held any share of stock&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the rules of paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 246(c) shall apply, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) there shall not be taken into account any day which is more than 6 months after the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Losses incurred under a periodic liquidation plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent provided in regulations, subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply to losses incurred on the sale or exchange of shares of stock in a regulated investment company pursuant to a plan which provides for the periodic liquidation of such shares.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A real estate investment trust which meets the requirements of this paragraph at the close of any quarter shall not lose its status as a real estate investment trust because of a discrepancy during a subsequent quarter between the value of its various investments and such requirements (including a discrepancy caused solely by the change in the foreign currency exchange rate used to value a foreign asset) unless such discrepancy exists immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property and is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition. A real estate investment trust which does not meet such requirements at the close of any quarter by reason of a discrepancy existing immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property which is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition during such quarter shall not lose its status for such quarter as a real estate investment trust if such discrepancy is eliminated within 30 days after the close of such quarter and in such cases it shall be considered to have met such requirements at the close of such quarter for purposes of applying the preceding sentence.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The term &ldquo;interests in real property&rdquo; includes fee ownership and co-ownership of land or improvements thereon, leaseholds of land or improvements thereon, options to acquire land or improvements thereon, and options to acquire leaseholds of land or improvements thereon, but does not include mineral, oil, or gas royalty interests.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) A regular or residual interest in a REMIC shall be treated as a real estate asset, and any amount includible in gross income with respect to such an interest shall be treated as interest on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property; except that, if less than 95 percent of the assets of such REMIC are real estate assets (determined as if the real estate investment trust held such assets), such real estate investment trust shall be treated as holding directly (and as receiving directly) its proportionate share of the assets and income of the <!-- PDFPage:1690 -->REMIC. For purposes of determining whether any interest in a REMIC qualifies under the preceding sentence, any interest held by such REMIC in another REMIC shall be treated as a real estate asset under principles similar to the principles of the preceding sentence, except that, if such REMIC's are part of a tiered structure, they shall be treated as one REMIC for purposes of this subparagraph.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirements applicable to real estate investment trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this part (other than subsection (d) of this section and subsection (g) of section 856) shall not apply to a real estate investment trust for a taxable year unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the deduction for dividends paid during the taxable year (as defined in section 561, but determined without regard to capital gains dividends) equals or exceeds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 90 percent of the real estate investment trust taxable income for the taxable year (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) and by excluding any net capital gain); and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1708 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 90 percent of the excess of the net income from foreclosure property over the tax imposed on such income by subsection (b)(4)(A); minus</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the provisions of this part apply to the real estate investment trust for all taxable years beginning after February 28, 1986, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as of the close of the taxable year, the real estate investment trust has no earnings and profits accumulated in any non-REIT year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;non-REIT year&rdquo; means any taxable year to which the provisions of this part did not apply with respect to the entity. The Secretary may waive the requirements of paragraph (1) for any taxable year if the real estate investment trust establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it was unable to meet such requirements by reason of distributions previously made to meet the requirements of section 4981.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of taxation of real estate investment trusts and holders of shares or certificates of beneficial interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Imposition of tax on real estate investment trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the real estate investment trust taxable income of every real estate investment trust a tax computed as provided in section 11, as though the real estate investment trust taxable income were the taxable income referred to in section 11.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Real estate investment trust taxable income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;real estate investment trust taxable income&rdquo; means the taxable income of the real estate investment trust, adjusted as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The deductions for corporations provided in part VIII (except section 248) of subchapter B (section 241 and following, relating to the deduction for dividends received, etc.) shall not be allowed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) shall be allowed, but shall be computed without regard to that portion of such deduction which is attributable to the amount excluded under subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The taxable income shall be computed without regard to section 443(b) (relating to computation of tax on change of annual accounting period).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) There shall be excluded an amount equal to the net income from foreclosure property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) There shall be deducted an amount equal to the tax imposed by paragraphs (5) and (7) of this subsection, section 856(c)(7)(C), and section 856(g)(5) for the taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) There shall be excluded an amount equal to any net income derived from prohibited transactions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Capital gains</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Alternative tax in case of capital gains</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If for any taxable year a real estate investment trust has a net capital gain, then, in lieu of the tax imposed by subsection (b)(1), there is hereby imposed a tax (if such tax is less than the tax imposed by such subsection) which shall consist of the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a tax, computed as provided in subsection (b)(1), on the real estate investment trust taxable income (determined by excluding such net capital gain and by computing the deduction for dividends paid without regard to capital gain dividends), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a tax determined at the rates provided in section 1201(a) on the excess of the net capital gain over the deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) determined with reference to capital gains dividends only.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of capital gain dividends by shareholders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A capital gain dividend shall be treated by the shareholders or holders of beneficial interests as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 1 year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Definition of capital gain dividend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this part, a capital gain dividend is any dividend, or part thereof, which is designated by the real estate investment trust as a capital gain dividend in a written notice mailed to its shareholders or holders of beneficial interests at any time before the expiration of 30 days after the close of its taxable year (or mailed to its shareholders or holders of beneficial interests with its annual report for the taxable year); except that, if there is an increase in the excess described in subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph for such year which results from a determination (as defined in section 860(e)), such designation may be made with respect to such increase at any time before the expiration of 120 days after the date of such determination. If the aggregate amount so designated with respect to a taxable year of the trust (including capital gain dividends paid after the close of the taxable year described in section 858) is greater than the net capital gain of the taxable year, the portion of each distribution which shall be a capital gain dividend shall be only that proportion of the amount so designated which such net capital gain bears to the aggregate amount so designated. For purposes of this subparagraph, the amount of the net capital gain for any taxable year which is not a calendar year shall be determined without regard to any net capital loss attributable to transactions after December 31 of such year, and any such net capital loss shall be treated as arising on the 1st day of the next taxable year. To the extent provided in regulations, the preceding sentence shall apply also for purposes of computing the taxable income of the real estate investment trust.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1709 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Treatment by shareholders of undistributed capital gains</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Every shareholder of a real estate investment trust at the close of the trust's taxable year shall include, in computing his long-term capital gains in his return for his taxable year in which the last day of the trust's taxable year falls, such amount as the trust shall designate in respect of such shares in a written notice mailed to its shareholders at any time prior to the expiration of 60 days after the close of its taxable year (or mailed to its shareholders or holders of beneficial interests with its annual report for the taxable year), but the amount so includible by any shareholder shall not exceed that part of the amount subjected to tax in subparagraph (A)(ii) which he would have received if all of such amount had been distributed as capital gain dividends by the trust to the holders of such shares at the close of its taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For purposes of this title, every such shareholder shall be deemed to have paid, for his taxable year under clause (i), the tax imposed by subparagraph (A)(ii) on the amounts required by this subparagraph to be included in respect of such shares in computing his long-term capital gains for that year; and such shareholders shall be allowed credit or refund as the case may be, for the tax so deemed to have been paid by him.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The adjusted basis of such shares in the hands of the holder shall be increased with respect to the amounts required by this subparagraph to be included in computing his long-term capital gains, by the difference between the amount of such includible gains and the tax deemed paid by such shareholder in respect of such shares under clause (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) In the event of such designation, the tax imposed by subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be paid by the real estate investment trust within 30 days after the close of its taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) The earnings and profits of such real estate investment trust, and the earnings and profits of any such shareholder which is a corporation, shall be appropriately adjusted in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) As used in this subparagraph, the terms &ldquo;shares&rdquo; and &ldquo;shareholders&rdquo; shall include beneficial interests and holders of beneficial interests, respectively.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Coordination with net operating loss provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of section 172, if a real estate investment trust pays capital gain dividends during any taxable year, the amount of the net capital gain for such taxable year (to the extent such gain does not exceed the amount of such capital gain dividends) shall be excluded in determining&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the net operating loss for the taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of the net operating loss of any prior taxable year which may be carried through such taxable year under section 172(b)(2) to a succeeding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Certain distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a shareholder of a real estate investment trust to whom section 897 does not apply by reason of the second sentence of section 897(h)(1), the amount which would be included in computing long-term capital gains for such shareholder under subparagraph (B) or (D) (without regard to this subparagraph)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall not be included in computing such shareholder's long-term capital gains, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall be included in such shareholder's gross income as a dividend from the real estate investment trust.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Income from foreclosure property</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Imposition of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A tax is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the net income from foreclosure property of every real estate investment trust. Such tax shall be computed by multiplying the net income from foreclosure property by the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Net income from foreclosure property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;net income from foreclosure property&rdquo; means the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) gain (including any foreign currency gain, as defined in section 988(b)(1)) from the sale or other disposition of foreclosure property described in section 1221(a)(1) and the gross income for the taxable year derived from foreclosure property (as defined in section 856(e)), but only to the extent such gross income is not described in (or, in the case of foreign currency gain, not attributable to gross income described in) section 856(c)(3) other than subparagraph (F) thereof, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the production of the income referred to in clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Imposition of tax in case of failure to meet certain requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If section 856(c)(6) applies to a real estate investment trust for any taxable year, there is hereby imposed on such trust a tax in an amount equal to the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 95 percent of the gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) of the real estate investment trust, over</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An entity (otherwise meeting the requirements of subsection (a)) may elect to be treated as a REMIC for its 1st taxable year.

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Excess inclusions may not be offset by net operating losses</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The taxable income of any holder of a residual interest in a REMIC for any taxable year shall in no event be less than the excess inclusion for such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule for affiliated groups</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All members of an affiliated group filing a consolidated return shall be treated as 1 taxpayer for purposes of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Coordination with section 172</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any excess inclusion for any taxable year shall not be taken into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in determining under section 172 the amount of any net operating loss for such taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in determining taxable income for such taxable year for purposes of the 2nd sentence of section 172(b)(2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Coordination with minimum tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of part VI of subchapter A of this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the reference in section 55(b)(2) to taxable income shall be treated as a reference to taxable income determined without regard to this subsection,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the alternative minimum taxable income of any holder of a residual interest in a REMIC for any taxable year shall in no event be less than the excess inclusion for such taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any excess inclusion shall be disregarded for purposes of computing the alternative tax net operating loss deduction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Organizations subject to unrelated business tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the holder of any residual interest in a REMIC is an organization subject to the tax imposed by section 511, the excess inclusion of such holder for any taxable year shall be treated as unrelated business taxable income of such holder for purposes of section 511.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Excess inclusion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, the daily accrual with respect to any residual interest for any day in any calendar quarter shall be determined by allocating to each day in such quarter its ratable portion of the product of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 120 percent of the long-term Federal rate (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each calendar quarter and properly adjusted for the length of such quarter).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjusted issue price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the adjusted issue price of any residual interest at the beginning of any calendar quarter is the issue price of the residual interest (adjusted for contributions)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) decreased (but not below zero) by any distribution made with respect to such interest before the beginning of such quarter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;Federal long-term rate&rdquo; means the Federal long-term rate which would have applied to the residual interest under section 1274(d) (determined without regard to paragraph (2) thereof) if it were a debt instrument.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Treatment of residual interests held by real estate investment trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a residual interest in a REMIC is held by a real estate investment trust, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the aggregate excess inclusions determined with respect to such interests, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the real estate investment trust taxable income (within the meaning of section 857(b)(2), excluding any net capital gain),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall be allocated among the shareholders of such trust in proportion to the dividends received by such shareholders from such trust, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any amount allocated to a shareholder under paragraph (1) shall be treated as an excess inclusion with respect to a residual interest held by such shareholder.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Rules similar to the rules of the preceding sentence shall apply also in the case of regulated investment companies, common trust funds, and organizations to which part I of subchapter T applies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b)(1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Liability</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Imposition of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, at any time during any taxable year of a pass-thru entity, a disqualified organization is the record holder of an interest in such entity, there is hereby imposed on such entity for such taxable year a tax equal to the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount of excess inclusions for such taxable year allocable to the interest held by such disqualified organization, multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b)(1).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Regular interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;regular interest&rdquo; means any interest in a REMIC which is issued on the startup day with fixed terms and which is designated as a regular interest if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such interest unconditionally entitles the holder to receive a specified principal amount (or other similar amount), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) interest payments (or other similar amount), if any, with respect to such interest at or before maturity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) are payable based on a fixed rate (or to the extent provided in regulations, at a variable rate), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) consist of a specified portion of the interest payments on qualified mortgages and such portion does not vary during the period such interest is outstanding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The interest shall not fail to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) merely because the timing (but not the amount) of the principal payments (or other similar amounts) may be contingent on the extent of prepayments on qualified mortgages and the amount of income from permitted investments. An interest shall not fail to qualify as a regular interest solely <!-- PDFPage:1730 -->because the specified principal amount of the regular interest (or the amount of interest accrued on the regular interest) can be reduced as a result of the nonoccurrence of 1 or more contingent payments with respect to any reverse mortgage loan held by the REMIC if, on the startup day for the REMIC, the sponsor reasonably believes that all principal and interest due under the regular interest will be paid at or prior to the liquidation of the REMIC.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Residual interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;residual interest&rdquo; means an interest in a REMIC which is issued on the startup day, which is not a regular interest, and which is designated as a residual interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Qualified mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;qualified mortgage&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is transferred to the REMIC on the startup day in exchange for regular or residual interests in the REMIC,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is purchased by the REMIC within the 3-month period beginning on the startup day if, except as provided in regulations, such purchase is pursuant to a fixed-price contract in effect on the startup day, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) represents an increase in the principal amount under the original terms of an obligation described in clause (i) or (ii) if such increase&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is attributable to an advance made to the obligor pursuant to the original terms of a reverse mortgage loan or other obligation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) occurs after the startup day, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) is purchased by the REMIC pursuant to a fixed price contract in effect on the startup day.<sup><a href="#860G_1_target" name="860G_1">1</a></sup></p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any qualified replacement mortgage, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any regular interest in another REMIC transferred to the REMIC on the startup day in exchange for regular or residual interests in the REMIC.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), any obligation secured by stock held by a person as a tenant-stockholder (as defined in section 216) in a cooperative housing corporation (as so defined) shall be treated as secured by an interest in real property. For purposes of subparagraph (A), any obligation originated by the United States or any State (or any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of the United States or any State) shall be treated as principally secured by an interest in real property if more than 50 percent of such obligations which are transferred to, or purchased by, the REMIC are principally secured by an interest in real property (determined without regard to this sentence).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Qualified replacement mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;qualified replacement mortgage&rdquo; means any obligation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which would be a qualified mortgage if transferred on the startup day in exchange for regular or residual interests in the REMIC, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which is received for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) another obligation within the 3-month period beginning on the startup day, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a defective obligation within the 2-year period beginning on the startup day.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Permitted investments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;permitted investments&rdquo; means any&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) cash flow investment,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) qualified reserve asset, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) foreclosure property.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Qualified reserve asset</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;qualified reserve asset&rdquo; means any intangible property which is held for investment and as part of a qualified reserve fund.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Qualified reserve fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;qualified reserve fund&rdquo; means any reasonably required reserve to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) provide for full payment of expenses of the REMIC or amounts due on regular interests in the event of defaults on qualified mortgages or lower than expected returns on cash flow investments, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provide a source of funds for the purchase of obligations described in clause (ii) or (iii) of paragraph (3)(A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The aggregate fair market value of the assets held in any such reserve shall not exceed 50 percent of the aggregate fair market value of all of the assets of the REMIC on the startup day, and the amount of any such reserve shall be promptly and appropriately reduced to the extent the amount held in such reserve is no longer reasonably required for purposes specified in clause (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A reserve shall not be treated as a qualified reserve for any taxable year (and all subsequent taxable years) if more than 30 percent of the gross income from the assets in such fund for the taxable year is derived from the sale or other disposition of property held for less than 3 months. For purposes of the preceding sentence, gain on the disposition of a qualified reserve asset shall not be taken into account if the disposition giving rise to such gain is required to prevent default on a regular interest where the threatened default resulted from a default on 1 or more qualified mortgages.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Foreclosure property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;foreclosure property&rdquo; means property&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1731 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which would be foreclosure property under section 856(e) (without regard to paragraph (5) thereof) if acquired by a real estate investment trust, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which is acquired in connection with the default or imminent default of a qualified mortgage held by the REMIC.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Solely for purposes of section 860D(a), the determination of whether any property is foreclosure property shall be made without regard to section 856(e)(4).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Startup day</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;startup day&rdquo; means the day on which the REMIC issues all of its regular and residual interests. To the extent provided in regulations, all interests issued (and all transfers to the REMIC) during any period (not exceeding 10 days) permitted in such regulations shall be treated as occurring on the day during such period selected by the REMIC for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Issue price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The issue price of any regular or residual interest in a REMIC shall be determined under section 1273(b) in the same manner as if such interest were a debt instrument; except that if the interest is issued for property, paragraph (3) of section 1273(b) shall apply whether or not the requirements of such paragraph are met.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Treatment of nonresident aliens and foreign corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the holder of a residual interest in a REMIC is a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation, for purposes of sections 871(a), 881, 1441, and 1442&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A tax is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the net income from foreclosure property of each REMIC. Such tax shall be computed by multiplying the net income from foreclosure property by the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Net income from foreclosure property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;net income from foreclosure property&rdquo; means the amount which would be the REMIC's net income from foreclosure property under section 857(b)(4)(B) if the REMIC were a real estate investment trust.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Tax on contributions after startup date</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), if any amount is contributed to a REMIC after the startup day, there is hereby imposed a tax for the taxable year of the REMIC in which the contribution is received equal to 100 percent of the amount of such contribution.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Any contribution during the 3-month period beginning on the startup day.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Any contribution to a qualified reserve fund by any holder of a residual interest in the REMIC.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Any other contribution permitted in regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this part, including regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to prevent unreasonable accumulations of assets in a REMIC,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) permitting determinations of the fair market value of property transferred to a REMIC and issue price of interests in a REMIC to be made earlier than otherwise provided,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) requiring reporting to holders of residual interests of such information as frequently as is necessary or appropriate to permit such holders to compute their taxable income accurately,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) providing appropriate rules for treatment of transfers of qualified replacement mortgages to the REMIC where the transferor holds any interest in the REMIC, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) providing that a mortgage will be treated as a qualified replacement mortgage only if it is part of a bona fide replacement (and not part of a swap of mortgages).</p>
