<p class="statutory-body-1em">At any time during the last half of the taxable year more than 50 percent in value of its outstanding stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by or for not more than 5 individuals.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Stock not owned by individual</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Options</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any person has an option to acquire stock, such stock shall be considered as owned by such person.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Stock constructively owned by a person by reason of the application of paragraph (1) or (3), shall, for purposes of applying paragraph (1) or (2), be treated as actually owned by such person; but stock constructively owned by an individual by reason of the application of paragraph (2) shall not be treated as owned by him for purposes of again applying such paragraph in order to make another the constructive owner of such stock.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Option rule in lieu of family and partnership rule</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for purposes of section 543(a)(7) (relating to personal service contracts), but only if the effect of the inclusion of all such securities is to make the amounts therein referred to includible under such paragraph as personal holding company income;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for purposes of section 543(a)(6) (relating to the use of property by shareholders), but only if the effect of the inclusion of all such securities is to make the amounts therein referred to includible under such paragraphs as personal holding company income; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) for purposes of section 543(a)(4) (relating to copyright royalties), but only if the effect of the inclusion of all such securities is to make the amounts therein referred to includible under such paragraph as personal holding company income.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The requirement in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) that all convertible securities must be included if any are to be included shall be subject to the exception that, where some of the outstanding securities are convertible only after a later date than in the case of others, the class having the earlier conversion date may be included although the others are not included, but no convertible securities shall be included unless all outstanding securities having a prior conversion date are also included.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;545. Undistributed personal holding company income</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;undistributed personal holding company income&rdquo; means the taxable income of a personal holding company adjusted in the manner provided in subsections (b), (c), and (d), minus the dividends paid deduction as defined in section 561. In the case of a personal holding company which is a foreign corporation, not more than 10 percent in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)) during the last half of the taxable year by United States persons, the term &ldquo;undistributed personal holding company income&rdquo; means the amount determined by multiplying the undistributed personal holding company income (determined without regard to this sentence) by the percentage in value of its outstanding stock which is the greatest percentage in value of its outstanding stock so owned by United States persons on any one day during such period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustments to taxable income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of subsection (a), the taxable income shall be adjusted as follows:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There shall be allowed as a deduction Federal income and excess profits taxes and in<!-- PDFPage:1072 -->come, war profits and excess profits taxes of foreign countries and possessions of the United States (to the extent not allowable as a deduction under section 275(a)(4)), accrued during the taxable year or deemed to be paid by a domestic corporation under section 902(a) or 960(a)(1) for the taxable year, but not including the accumulated earnings tax imposed by section 531, the personal holding company tax imposed by section 541, or the taxes imposed by corresponding sections of a prior income tax law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Charitable contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The deduction for charitable contributions provided under section 170 shall be allowed, but in computing such deduction the limitations in section 170(b)(1)(A), (B), and (D) shall apply, and section 170(b)(2) and (d)(1) shall not apply. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;contribution base&rdquo; when used in section 170(b)(1) means the taxable income computed with the adjustments (other than the 10-percent limitation) provided in section 170(b)(2) and (d)(1) and without deduction of the amount disallowed under paragraph (6) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special deductions disallowed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The special deductions for corporations provided in part VIII (except section 248) of subchapter B (section 241 and following, relating to the deduction for dividends received by corporations, etc.) shall not be allowed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Net operating loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The net operating loss deduction provided in section 172 shall not be allowed, but there shall be allowed as a deduction the amount of the net operating loss (as defined in section 172(c)) for the preceding taxable year computed without the deductions provided in part VIII (except section 248) of subchapter B.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Net capital gains</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There shall be allowed as a deduction the net capital gain for the taxable year, minus the taxes imposed by this subtitle attributable to such net capital gain. The taxes attributable to such net capital gain shall be an amount equal to the difference between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the taxes imposed by this subtitle (except the tax imposed by this part) for such year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such taxes computed for such year without including such excess in taxable income.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Expenses and depreciation applicable to property of the taxpayer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The aggregate of the deductions allowed under section 162 (relating to trade or business expenses) and section 167 (relating to depreciation), which are allocable to the operation and maintenance of property owned or operated by the corporation, shall be allowed only in an amount equal to the rent or other compensation received for the use of, or the right to use, the property, unless it is established (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) to the satisfaction of the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that the rent or other compensation received was the highest obtainable, or, if none was received, that none was obtainable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that the property was held in the course of a business carried on bona fide for profit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) either that there was reasonable expectation that the operation of the property would result in a profit, or that the property was necessary to the conduct of the business.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Special rule for capital gains and losses of foreign corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a foreign corporation, paragraph (5) shall be applied by taking into account only gains and losses which are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and are not exempt from tax under treaty.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certain foreign corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a foreign corporation all of the outstanding stock of which during the last half of the taxable year is owned by nonresident alien individuals (whether directly or indirectly through foreign estates, foreign trusts, foreign partnerships, or other foreign corporations), the taxable income for purposes of subsection (a) shall be the income which constitutes personal holding company income under section 543(a)(7), reduced by the deductions attributable to such income, and adjusted, with respect to such income, in the manner provided in subsection (b).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;547. Deduction for deficiency dividends</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a determination (as defined in subsection (c)) with respect to a taxpayer establishes liability for personal holding company tax imposed by section 541 (or by a corresponding provision of a prior income tax law) for any taxable year, a deduction shall be allowed to the taxpayer for the amount of deficiency dividends (as defined in subsection (d)) for the purpose of determining the personal holding company tax for such year, but not for the purpose of determining interest, additional amounts, or assessable penalties computed with respect to such personal holding company tax.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rules for application of section</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Allowance of deduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The deficiency dividend deduction shall be allowed as of the date the claim for the deficiency dividend deduction is filed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Credit or refund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the allowance of a deficiency dividend deduction results in an overpayment of personal holding company tax for any taxable year, credit or refund with respect to such overpayment shall be made as if on the date of the determination 2 years remained before the expiration of the period of limitation on the filing of claim for refund for the taxable year to which the overpayment relates. No interest shall be allowed on a credit or refund arising from the application of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;determination&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a decision by the Tax Court or a judgment, decree, or other order by any court of competent jurisdiction, which has become final;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a closing agreement made under section 7121; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, an agreement signed by the Secretary and by, or on behalf of, the taxpayer relating to the liability of such taxpayer for personal holding company tax.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Deficiency dividends</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;deficiency dividends&rdquo; means the amount of the dividends paid by the corporation on or after the date of the determination and before filing claim under subsection (e), which would have been includible in the computation of the deduction for dividends paid under section 561 for the taxable year with respect to which the liability for personal holding company tax exists, if distributed during such taxable year. <!-- PDFPage:1075 -->No dividends shall be considered as deficiency dividends for purposes of subsection (a) unless distributed within 90 days after the determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effect on dividends paid deduction</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) For taxable year in which paid</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Deficiency dividends paid in any taxable year (to the extent of the portion thereof taken into account under subsection (a) in determining personal holding company tax) shall not be included in the amount of dividends paid for such year for purposes of computing the dividends paid deduction for such year and succeeding years.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) For prior taxable year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Deficiency dividends paid in any taxable year (to the extent of the portion thereof taken into account under subsection (a) in determining personal holding company tax) shall not be allowed for purposes of section 563(b) in the computation of the dividends paid deduction for the taxable year preceding the taxable year in which paid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Claim required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No deficiency dividend deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) unless (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) claim therefor is filed within 120 days after the determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Suspension of statute of limitations and stay of collection</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Suspension of running of statute</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the corporation files a claim, as provided in subsection (e), the running of the statute of limitations provided in section 6501 on the making of assessments, and the bringing of distraint or a proceeding in court for collection, in respect of the deficiency and all interest, additional amounts, or assessable penalties, shall be suspended for a period of 2 years after the date of the determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Stay of collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any deficiency with respect to the tax imposed by section 541 established by a determination under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the collection of the deficiency and all interest, additional amounts, and assessable penalties shall, except in cases of jeopardy, be stayed until the expiration of 120 days after the date of the determination, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if claim for deficiency dividend deduction is filed under subsection (e), the collection of such part of the deficiency as is not reduced by the deduction for deficiency dividends provided in subsection (a) shall be stayed until the date the claim is disallowed (in whole or in part) and if disallowed in part collection shall be made only with respect to the part disallowed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">No distraint or proceeding in court shall be begun for the collection of an amount the collection of which is stayed under subparagraph (A) or (B) during the period for which the collection of such amount is stayed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Deduction denied in case of fraud, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No deficiency dividend deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) if the determination contains a finding that any part of the deficiency is due to fraud with intent to evade tax, or to wilful failure to file an income tax return within the time prescribed by law or prescribed by the Secretary in pursuance of law.</p>
