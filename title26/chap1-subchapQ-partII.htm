<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a determination (as defined in section 1313) is described in one or more of the paragraphs of section 1312 and, on the date of the determination, correction of the effect of the error referred to in the applicable paragraph of section 1312 is prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law, other than this part and other than section 7122 (relating to compromises), then the effect of the error shall be corrected by an adjustment made in the amount and in the manner specified in section 1314.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions necessary for adjustment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Maintenance of an inconsistent position</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except in cases described in paragraphs (3) (B) and (4) of section 1312, an adjustment shall be made under this part only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in case the amount of the adjustment would be credited or refunded in the same manner as an overpayment under section 1314, there is adopted in the determination a position maintained by the Secretary, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in case the amount of the adjustment would be assessed and collected in the same manner as a deficiency under section 1314, there is adopted in the determination a position maintained by the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">and the position maintained by the Secretary in the case described in subparagraph (A) or maintained by the taxpayer in the case described in subparagraph (B) is inconsistent with the erroneous inclusion, exclusion, omission, allowance, disallowance, recognition, or non-recognition, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Correction not barred at time of erroneous action</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Determination described in section 1312(3)(B)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a determination described in section 1312(3)(B) (relating to certain exclusions from income), adjustment shall be made under this part only if assessment of a deficiency for the taxable year in which the item is includible or against the related taxpayer was not barred, by any law or rule of law, at the time the Secretary first maintained, in a notice of deficiency sent pursuant to section 6212 or before the Tax Court that the item described in section 1312(3)(B) should be included in the gross income of the taxpayer for the taxable year to which the determination relates.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determination described in section 1312(4)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a determination described in section 1312(4) (relating to disallowance of certain deductions and credits), adjustment shall be made under this part only if credit or refund of the overpayment attributable to the deduction or credit described in such section which should have been allowed to the taxpayer or related taxpayer was not barred, by any law or rule of law, at the time the taxpayer first maintained before the Secretary or before the Tax Court, in writing, that he was entitled to such deduction or credit for the taxable year to which the determination relates.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Existence of relationship</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In case the amount of the adjustment would be assessed and collected in the same manner as a deficiency (except for cases described in section 1312(3)(B)), the adjustment shall not be made with respect to a related taxpayer unless he stands in such relationship to the taxpayer at the time the latter first maintains the inconsistent position in a return, claim for refund, or petition (or amended petition) to the Tax Court for the taxable year with respect to <!-- PDFPage:1882 -->which the determination is made, or if such position is not so maintained, then at the time of the determination.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Items not included in income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The determination requires the exclusion from gross income of an item not included in a return filed by the taxpayer and with respect to which the tax was not paid but which is includible in the gross income of the taxpayer for another taxable year or in the gross income of a related taxpayer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Double disallowance of a deduction or credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The determination disallows a deduction or credit which should have been allowed to, but was not allowed to, the taxpayer for another taxable year, or to a related taxpayer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Correlative deductions and inclusions for trusts or estates and legatees, beneficiaries, or heirs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The determination allows or disallows any of the additional deductions allowable in computing the taxable income of estates or trusts, or requires or denies any of the inclusions in the computation of taxable income of beneficiaries, heirs, or legatees, specified in subparts A to E, inclusive (secs. 641 and following, relating to estates, trusts, and beneficiaries) of part I of subchapter J of this chapter, or corresponding provisions of prior internal revenue laws, and the correlative inclusion or deduction, as the case may be, has been erroneously excluded, omitted, or included, or disallowed, omitted, or allowed, as the case may be, in respect of the related taxpayer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Correlative deductions and credits for certain related corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The determination allows or disallows a deduction (including a credit) in computing the taxable income (or, as the case may be, net income, normal tax net income, or surtax net income) of a corporation, and a correlative deduction or credit has been erroneously allowed, omitted, or disallowed, as the case may be, in respect of a related taxpayer described in section 1313(c)(7).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Basis of property after erroneous treatment of a prior transaction</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The determination determines the basis of property, and in respect of any transaction on which such basis depends, or in respect of any transaction which was erroneously treated as affecting such basis, there occurred, with respect to a taxpayer described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, any of the errors described in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Taxpayers with respect to whom the erroneous treatment occurred</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The taxpayer with respect to whom the erroneous treatment occurred must be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a taxpayer who acquired title to the property in the transaction and from whom, mediately or immediately, the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made derived title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a taxpayer who had title to the property at the time of the transaction and from whom, mediately or immediately, the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made derived title, if the basis of the property in the hands of the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made is determined under section 1015(a) (relating to the basis of property acquired by gift).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prior erroneous treatment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to a taxpayer described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) there was an erroneous inclusion in, or omission from, gross income,</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Ascertainment of amount of adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In computing the amount of an adjustment under this part there shall first be ascertained the tax previously determined for the taxable year with respect to which the error was made. The amount of the tax previously determined shall be the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount shown as the tax by the taxpayer on his return (determined as provided in section 6211(b)(1), (3), and (4), relating to the definition of deficiency), if a return was made by the taxpayer and an amount was shown as the tax by the taxpayer thereon, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amounts previously assessed (or collected without assessment) as a deficiency, over&mdash;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of rebates, as defined in section 6211(b)(2), made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">There shall then be ascertained the increase or decrease in tax previously determined which results solely from the correct treatment of the item which was the subject of the error (with due regard given to the effect of the item in the computation of gross income, taxable income, and other matters under this subtitle). A similar computation shall be made for any other taxable year affected, or treated as affected, by a net operating loss deduction (as defined in section 172) or by a capital loss carryback or carryover (as defined in section 1212), determined with reference to the taxable year with respect to which the error was made. The amount so ascertained (together with any amounts wrongfully collected as additions to the tax or interest, as a result of such error) for each taxable year shall be the amount of the adjustment for that taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The adjustment authorized in section 1311(a) shall be made by assessing and collecting, or refunding or crediting, the amount thereof in the same manner as if it were a deficiency determined by the Secretary with respect to the taxpayer as to whom the error was made or an overpayment claimed by such taxpayer, as the case may be, for the taxable year or years with respect to which an amount is ascertained under subsection (a), and as if on the date of the determination one year remained before the expiration of the periods of limitation upon assessment or filing claim for refund for such taxable year or years. If, as a result of a determination described in section 1313(a)(4), an adjustment has been made by the assessment and collection <!-- PDFPage:1884 -->of a deficiency or the refund or credit of an overpayment, and subsequently such determination is altered or revoked, the amount of the adjustment ascertained under subsection (a) of this section shall be redetermined on the basis of such alteration or revocation and any overpayment or deficiency resulting from such redetermination shall be refunded or credited, or assessed and collected, as the case may be, as an adjustment under this part. In the case of an adjustment resulting from an increase or decrease in a net operating loss or net capital loss which is carried back to the year of adjustment, interest shall not be collected or paid for any period prior to the close of the taxable year in which the net operating loss or net capital loss arises.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjustment unaffected by other items</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount to be assessed and collected in the same manner as a deficiency, or to be refunded or credited in the same manner as an overpayment, under this part, shall not be diminished by any credit or set-off based upon any item other than the one which was the subject of the adjustment. The amount of the adjustment under this part, if paid, shall not be recovered by a claim or suit for refund or suit for erroneous refund based upon any item other than the one which was the subject of the adjustment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Periods for which adjustments may be made</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No adjustment shall be made under this part in respect of any taxable year beginning prior to January 1, 1932.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Taxes imposed by subtitle C</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This part shall not apply to any tax imposed by subtitle C (sec. 3101 and following relating to employment taxes).</p>
