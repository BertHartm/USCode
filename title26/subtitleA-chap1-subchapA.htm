A subaward under this section may be made to finance a qualified low-income building with or without an allocation under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, except that a State housing credit agency may make subawards to finance qualified low-income buildings without an allocation only if it makes a determination that such use will increase the total funds available to the State to build and rehabilitate affordable housing. In complying with such determination requirement, a State housing credit agency shall establish a process in which applicants that are allocated credits are required to demonstrate good faith efforts to obtain investment commitments for such credits before the agency makes such subawards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Subawards subject to same requirements as low-income housing credit allocations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any such subaward with respect to any qualified low-income building shall be made in the same manner and shall be subject to the same limitations (including rent, income, and use restrictions on such building) as an allocation of housing credit dollar amount allocated by such State housing credit agency under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, except that such subawards shall not be limited by, or otherwise affect (except as provided in subsection (h)(3)(J) of such section [section 42(h)(3) has no subpar.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) <cap-smallcap>Compliance and asset management</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The State housing credit agency shall perform asset management functions to ensure compliance with section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the long-term viability of buildings funded by any subaward under this section. The State housing credit agency may collect reasonable fees from a subaward recipient to cover expenses associated with the performance of its duties under this paragraph. The State housing credit agency may retain an agent or other private contractor to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) <cap-smallcap>Recapture</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The State housing credit agency shall impose conditions or restrictions, including a requirement providing for recapture, on any subaward under this section so as to assure that the building with respect to which such subaward is made remains a qualified low-income building during the compliance period. Any such recapture shall be payable to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit in the general fund of the Treasury and may be enforced by means of liens or such other methods as the Secretary of the Treasury determines appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Return of Unused Grant Funds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any grant funds not used to make subawards under this section before January 1, 2011, shall be returned to the Secretary of the Treasury on such date. Any subawards returned to the State housing credit agency on or after such date shall be promptly returned to the Secretary of the Treasury. Any amounts returned to the Secretary of the Treasury under this subsection shall be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the credit amount, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the qualified crude oil production and the qualified natural gas production which is attributable to the taxpayer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Credit amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The credit amount is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) $3 per barrel of qualified crude oil production, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 50 cents per 1,000 cubic feet of qualified natural gas production.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reduction as oil and gas prices increase</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The $3 and 50 cents amounts under paragraph (1) shall each be reduced (but not below zero) by an amount which bears the same ratio to such amount (determined without regard to this paragraph) as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the excess (if any) of the applicable reference price over $15 ($1.67 for qualified natural gas production), bears to</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) $3 ($0.33 for qualified natural gas production).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The applicable reference price for a taxable year is the reference price of the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the taxable year begins.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Inflation adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2005, each of the dollar amounts contained in subparagraph (A) shall be increased to an amount equal to such dollar amount multiplied by the inflation adjustment factor for such calendar year (determined under section 43(b)(3)(B) by substituting &ldquo;2004&rdquo; for &ldquo;1990&rdquo;).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation on amount of production which may qualify</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Crude oil or natural gas produced during any taxable year from any well shall not be treated as qualified crude oil production or qualified natural gas production to the extent production from the well during the taxable year exceeds 1,095 barrels or barrel-of-oil equivalents (as defined in section 45K(d)(5)).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Proportionate reductions</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Short taxable years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of a short taxable year, the limitations under this paragraph shall be proportionately reduced to reflect the ratio which the number of days in such taxable year bears to 365.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:240 --><h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Wells not in production entire year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of a well which is not capable of production during each day of a taxable year, the limitations under this paragraph applicable to the well shall be proportionately reduced to reflect the ratio which the number of days of production bears to the total number of days in the taxable year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) has average daily production of not more than 25 barrel-of-oil equivalents (as so defined), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) produces water at a rate not less than 95 percent of total well effluent.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Crude oil, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The terms &ldquo;crude oil&rdquo;, &ldquo;natural gas&rdquo;, &ldquo;domestic&rdquo;, and &ldquo;barrel&rdquo; have the meanings given such terms by section 613A(e).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Other rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Production attributable to the taxpayer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a qualified marginal well in which there is more than one owner of operating interests in the well and the crude oil or natural gas production exceeds the limitation under subsection (c)(2), qualifying crude oil production or qualifying natural gas production attributable to the taxpayer shall be determined on the basis of the ratio which taxpayer's revenue interest in the production bears to the aggregate of the revenue interests of all operating interest owners in the production.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Operating interest required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any credit under this section may be claimed only on production which is attributable to the holder of an operating interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Production from nonconventional sources excluded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of production from a qualified marginal well which is eligible for the credit allowed under section 45K for the taxable year, no credit shall be allowable under this section unless the taxpayer elects not to claim the credit under section 45K with respect to the well.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Allowance of credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a taxpayer holds a clean renewable energy bond on one or more credit allowance dates of the bond occurring during any taxable year, there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year an amount equal to the sum of the credits determined under subsection (b) with respect to such dates.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount of credit</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the credit determined under this subsection with respect to any credit allowance date for a clean renewable energy bond is 25 percent of the annual credit determined with respect to such bond.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The annual credit determined with respect to any clean renewable energy bond is the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the credit rate determined by the Secretary under paragraph (3) for the day on which such bond was sold, multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the outstanding face amount of the bond.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (2), with respect to any clean renewable energy bond, the Secretary shall determine daily or cause to be determined daily a credit rate which shall apply to the first day on which there is a binding, written contract for the sale or exchange of the bond. The credit rate for any day is the credit rate which the Secretary or the Secretary's designee estimates will permit the issuance of clean renewable energy bonds with a specified maturity or redemption date without discount and without interest cost to the qualified issuer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Credit allowance date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;credit allowance date&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) March 15,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) June 15,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) December 15.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Such term also includes the last day on which the bond is outstanding.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Special rule for issuance and redemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a bond which is issued during the 3-month period ending on a credit allowance date, the amount of the credit determined under this subsection with respect to such credit allowance date shall be a ratable portion of the credit otherwise determined based on the portion of the 3-month period during which the bond is outstanding. A similar rule shall apply when the bond is redeemed or matures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation based on amount of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The credit allowed under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the sum of the regular tax liability (as defined in section 26(b)) plus the tax imposed by section 55, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the sum of the credits allowable under this part (other than subparts C, I, and J, section 1400N(<em>l</em>), and this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Clean renewable energy bond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;clean renewable energy bond&rdquo; means any bond issued as part of an issue if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the bond is issued by a qualified issuer pursuant to an allocation by the Secretary to such issuer of a portion of the national clean renewable energy bond limitation under subsection (f)(2),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 95 percent or more of the proceeds of such issue are to be used for capital expenditures incurred by qualified borrowers for one or more qualified projects,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the qualified issuer designates such bond for purposes of this section and the bond is in registered form, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the issue meets the requirements of subsection (h).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Qualified project; special use rules</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;qualified project&rdquo; means any qualified facility (as determined under section 45(d) without regard to paragraph (10) and to any placed in service date) owned by a qualified borrower.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Refinancing rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), a qualified project may be refinanced with proceeds of a clean renewable energy bond only if the indebtedness being refinanced (including any obligation directly or indirectly refinanced by such indebtedness) was originally incurred by a qualified borrower after the date of the enactment of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Reimbursement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), a clean renewable energy bond may be issued to reimburse a qualified borrower for amounts paid after the date of the enactment of this section with respect to a qualified project, but only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) prior to the payment of the original expenditure, the qualified borrower declared its intent to reimburse such expenditure with the proceeds of a clean renewable energy bond,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) not later than 60 days after payment of the original expenditure, the qualified issuer adopts an official intent to reimburse the original expenditure with such proceeds, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the reimbursement is made not later than 18 months after the date the original expenditure is paid.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Treatment of changes in use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), the proceeds of an issue shall not be treated as used for a qualified project to the extent that a qualified borrower or qualified issuer takes any action within its control which causes such proceeds not to be used for a qualified project. The Secretary shall prescribe regulations specifying remedial actions that may be taken (including conditions to taking such remedial actions) to prevent an action described in the preceding sentence from causing a bond to fail to be a clean renewable energy bond.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Maturity limitations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Duration of term</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A bond shall not be treated as a clean renewable energy bond if the maturity of such bond exceeds the maximum term determined by the Secretary under paragraph (2) with respect to such bond.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Maximum term</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During each calendar month, the Secretary shall determine the maximum term permitted under this paragraph for bonds issued during the following calendar month. Such maximum term shall be the term which the Secretary estimates will result in the present value of the obligation to repay the principal on the bond being equal to 50 percent of the face amount of such bond. Such present value shall be determined without regard to the requirements of subsection (<em>l</em>)(6) and using as a discount rate the average annual interest rate of tax-exempt obligations having a term of 10 years or more which are issued during the month. If the term as so determined is not a multiple of a whole year, such term shall be rounded to the next highest whole year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation on amount of bonds designated</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) National limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There is a national clean renewable energy bond limitation of $1,200,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allocation by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall allocate the amount described in paragraph (1) among qualified projects in such manner as the Secretary determines appropriate, except that the Secretary may not allocate more than $750,000,000 of the national clean renewable energy bond limitation to finance qualified projects of qualified borrowers which are governmental bodies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Credit included in gross income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Gross income includes the amount of the credit allowed to the taxpayer under this section <!-- PDFPage:324 -->(determined without regard to subsection (c)) and the amount so included shall be treated as interest income.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Special rules relating to expenditures</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such fund is funded in a manner reasonably expected to result in an amount not greater than an amount necessary to repay the issue, and</p>
