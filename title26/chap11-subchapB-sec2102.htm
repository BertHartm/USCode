<p class="statutory-body">The maximum credit allowed under section 2011 against the tax imposed by section 2101 for State death taxes paid shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the credit computed as provided in section 2011(b) as the value of the property, as determined for purposes of this chapter, upon which State death taxes were paid and which is included in the gross estate under section 2103 bears to the value of the total gross estate under section 2103. For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;State death taxes&rdquo; means the taxes described in section 2011(a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Unified credit</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A credit of $13,000 shall be allowed against the tax imposed by section 2101.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Coordination with treaties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent required under any treaty obligation of the United States, the credit allowed under this subsection shall be equal to the amount which bears the same ratio to the applicable credit amount in effect under section 2010(c) for the calendar year which includes the date of death as the value of the part of the decedent's gross estate which at the time of his death is situated in the United States bears to the value of his entire gross estate wherever situated. For purposes of the preceding sentence, property shall not be treated as situated in the United States if such property is exempt from the tax imposed by this subchapter under any treaty obligation of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a credit has been allowed under section 2505 with respect to any gift made by the decedent, each dollar amount contained in paragraph (1) or (2) or subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (whichever applies) shall be reduced by the amount so allowed.</p>
