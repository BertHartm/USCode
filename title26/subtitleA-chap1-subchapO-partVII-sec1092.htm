<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitation on recognition of loss</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any loss with respect to 1 or more positions shall be taken into account for any taxable year only to the extent that the amount of such loss exceeds the unrecognized gain (if any) with respect to 1 or more positions which were offsetting positions with respect to 1 or more positions from which the loss arose.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Carryover of loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any loss which may not be taken into account under subparagraph (A) for any taxable year shall, subject to the limitations under subparagraph (A), be treated as sustained in the succeeding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule for identified straddles</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any straddle which is an identified straddle&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to identified positions comprising the identified straddle,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if there is any loss with respect to any identified position of the identified straddle, the basis of each of the identified offsetting positions in the identified straddle shall be increased by an amount which bears the same ratio to the loss as the unrecognized gain with respect to such offsetting position bears to the aggregate unrecognized gain with respect to all such offsetting positions, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) any loss described in clause (ii) shall not otherwise be taken into account for purposes of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Identified straddle</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;identified straddle&rdquo; means any straddle&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) which is clearly identified on the taxpayer's records as an identified straddle before the earlier of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) such time as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to the extent provided by regulations, the value of each position of which (in the hands of the taxpayer immediately before the creation of the straddle) is not less than the basis of such position in the hands of the taxpayer at the time the straddle is created, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) which is not part of a larger straddle.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations or other guidance as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this paragraph. Such regulations or other guidance may specify the proper methods for clearly identifying a straddle as an identified straddle (and for identifying the positions comprising such straddle), the rules for the application of this section to a taxpayer which fails to comply with those identification requirements, and the ordering rules in cases where a taxpayer disposes (or otherwise ceases to be the holder) of any part of any position which is part of an identified straddle.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of any position with respect to which, as of the close of the taxable year, gain has been realized but not recognized, the amount of gain so realized.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule for identified straddles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (2)(A)(ii), the unrecognized gain with respect to any identified offsetting position shall be the excess of the fair market value of the position at the time of the determination over the fair market value of the position at the time the taxpayer identified the position as a position in an identified straddle.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Reporting of gain</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Each taxpayer shall disclose to the Secretary, at such time and in such manner and form as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) to any position which, with respect to the taxpayer, is property described in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1221(a) or to any position which is part of a hedging transaction (as defined in section 1256(e)), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) with respect to any taxable year if no loss on a position (including a regulated futures contract) has been sustained during such taxable year or if the only loss sustained on such position is a loss described in subclause (II).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations with respect to gain or loss on positions which are a part of a straddle as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section and section 263(g).

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A taxpayer holds offsetting positions with respect to personal property if there is a substantial diminution of the taxpayer's risk of loss from holding any position with respect to personal property by reason of his holding 1 or more other positions with respect to personal property (whether or not of the same kind).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule for identified straddles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any position which is not part of an identified straddle (within the meaning of subsection (a)(2)(B)), such position shall not be treated as offsetting with respect to any position which is part of an identified straddle.</p>
