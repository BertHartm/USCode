<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to the extent of the applicability of the exclusion described in section 2031(c), the basis in the hands of the decedent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Property acquired from the decedent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (a), the following property shall be considered to have been acquired from or to have passed from the decedent:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Property passing without full and adequate consideration under a general power of appointment exercised by the decedent by will;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) In the case of decedents dying after August 26, 1937, property acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance or by the decedent's estate from the decedent, if the property consists of stock or securities of a foreign corporation, which with respect to its taxable year next preceding the date of the decedent's death was, under the law applicable to such year, a foreign personal holding company. In such case, the basis shall be the fair market value of such property at the date of the decedent's death or the basis in the hands of the decedent, whichever is lower;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) In the case of decedents dying after December 31, 1947, property which represents the surviving spouse's one-half share of community property held by the decedent and the surviving spouse under the community property laws of any State, or possession of the United States or any foreign country, if at least one-half of the whole of the community interest in such property was includible in determining the value of the decedent's gross estate under chapter 11 of subtitle B (section 2001 and following, relating to estate tax) or section 811 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) In the case of decedents dying after October 21, 1942, and on or before December 31, 1947, such part of any property, representing the surviving spouse's one-half share of property held by a decedent and the surviving spouse under the community property laws of any State, or possession of the United States or any foreign country, as was included in determining the value of the gross estate of the decedent, if a tax under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 was payable on the transfer of the net estate of the decedent. In such case, nothing in this paragraph shall reduce the basis below that which would exist if the Revenue Act of 1948 had not been enacted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) In the case of decedents dying after December 31, 1950, and before January 1, 1954, property which represents the survivor's interest in a joint and survivor's annuity if the value of any part of such interest was required to be included in determining the value of decedent's gross estate under section 811 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) In the case of decedents dying after December 31, 1953, property acquired from the decedent by reason of death, form of ownership, or other conditions (including property acquired through the exercise or non-exercise of a power of appointment), if by reason thereof the property is required to be included in determining the value of the decedent's gross estate under chapter 11 of subtitle B or under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. In such case, if the property is acquired before the death of the decedent, the basis shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) reduced by the amount allowed to the taxpayer as deductions in computing taxable income under this subtitle or prior income tax laws for exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion on such property before the death of the decedent. Such basis shall be applicable to the property commencing on the death of the decedent. This paragraph shall not apply to&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Property representing income in respect of a decedent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not apply to property which constitutes a right to receive an item of income in respect of a decedent under section 691.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rule with respect to DISC stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If stock owned by a decedent in a DISC or former DISC (as defined in section 992(a)) acquires a new basis under subsection (a), such basis (determined before the application of this subsection) shall be reduced by the amount (if any) which would have been included in gross income under section 995(c) as a dividend if the decedent had lived and sold the stock at its fair market value on the estate tax valuation date. In computing the gain the decedent would have had if he had lived and sold the stock, his basis shall be determined without regard to the last sentence of section 996(e)(2) (relating to reductions of basis of DISC stock). For purposes of this subsection, the estate tax valuation date is the date of the decedent's death or, in the case of an election under section 2032, the applicable valuation date prescribed by that section.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the basis of such property in the hands of such donor (or spouse) shall be the adjusted basis of such property in the hands of the decedent immediately before the death of the decedent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Appreciated property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;appreciated property&rdquo; means any property if the fair market value of such <!-- PDFPage:1719 -->property on the day it was transferred to the decedent by gift exceeds its adjusted basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of certain property sold by estate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any appreciated property described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) sold by the estate of the decedent or by a trust of which the decedent was the grantor, rules similar to the rules of paragraph (1) shall apply to the extent the donor of such property (or the spouse of such donor) is entitled to the proceeds from such sale.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Gifts after December 31, 1920</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the property was acquired by gift after December 31, 1920, the basis shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the donor or the last preceding owner by whom it was not acquired by gift, except that if such basis (adjusted for the period before the date of the gift as provided in section 1016) is greater than the fair market value of the property at the time of the gift, then for the purpose of determining loss the basis shall be such fair market value. If the facts necessary to determine the basis in the hands of the donor or the last preceding owner are unknown to the donee, the Secretary shall, if possible, obtain such facts from such donor or last preceding owner, or any other person cognizant thereof. If the Secretary finds it impossible to obtain such facts, the basis in the hands of such donor or last preceding owner shall be the fair market value of such property as found by the Secretary as of the date or approximate date at which, according to the best information that the Secretary is able to obtain, such property was acquired by such donor or last preceding owner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Transfer in trust after December 31, 1920</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the property was acquired after December 31, 1920, by a transfer in trust (other than by a transfer in trust by a gift, bequest, or devise), the basis shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the grantor increased in the amount of gain or decreased in the amount of loss recognized to the grantor on such transfer under the law applicable to the year in which the transfer was made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Gift or transfer in trust before January 1, 1921</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the property was acquired by gift or transfer in trust on or before December 31, 1920, the basis shall be the fair market value of such property at the time of such acquisition.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Increased basis for gift tax paid</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the property is acquired by gift on or after September 2, 1958, the basis shall be the basis determined under subsection (a), increased (but not above the fair market value of the property at the time of the gift) by the amount of gift tax paid with respect to such gift, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the property was acquired by gift before September 2, 1958, and has not been sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of before such date, the basis of the property shall be increased on such date by the amount of gift tax paid with respect to such gift, but such increase shall not exceed an amount equal to the amount by which the fair market value of the property at the time of the gift exceeded the basis of the property in the hands of the donor at the time of the gift.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of tax paid with respect to gift</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the amount of gift tax paid with respect to any gift is an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of gift tax paid under chapter 12 with respect to all gifts made by the donor for the calendar year (or preceding calendar period) in which such gift is made as the amount of such gift bears to the taxable gifts (as defined in section 2503(a) but computed without the deduction allowed by section 2521) made by the donor during such calendar year or period. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the amount of any gift shall be the amount included with respect to such gift in determin<!-- PDFPage:1721 -->ing (for the purposes of section 2503(a)) the total amount of gifts made during the calendar year or period, reduced by the amount of any deduction allowed with respect to such gift under section 2522 (relating to charitable deduction) or under section 2523 (relating to marital deduction).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Gifts treated as made one-half by each spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), where the donor and his spouse elected, under section 2513 to have the gift considered as made one-half by each, the amount of gift tax paid with respect to such gift under chapter 12 shall be the sum of the amounts of tax paid with respect to each half of such gift (computed in the manner provided in paragraph (2)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment as adjustment to basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of section 1016(b), an increase in basis under paragraph (1) shall be treated as an adjustment under section 1016(a).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Application to gifts before 1955</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to any property acquired by gift before 1955, references in this subsection to any provision of this title shall be deemed to refer to the corresponding provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or prior revenue laws which was effective for the year in which such gift was made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Special rule for gifts made after December 31, 1976</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any gift made after December 31, 1976, the increase in basis provided by this subsection with respect to any gift for the gift tax paid under chapter 12 shall be an amount (not in excess of the amount of tax so paid) which bears the same ratio to the amount of tax so paid as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the net appreciation in value of the gift, bears to</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of the gift.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Net appreciation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the net appreciation in value of any gift is the amount by which the fair market value of the gift exceeds the donor's adjusted basis immediately before the gift.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Gifts between spouses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any property acquired by gift in a transfer described in section 1041(a), the basis of such property in the hands of the transferee shall be determined under section 1041(b)(2) and not this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Nonrecognition of gain or loss from exchanges solely in kind</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No gain or loss shall be recognized on the exchange of property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment if such property is exchanged solely for property of like kind which is to be held either for productive use in a trade or business or for investment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to any exchange of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) stock in trade or other property held primarily for sale,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) stocks, bonds, or notes,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) other securities or evidences of indebtedness or interest,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) interests in a partnership,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) certificates of trust or beneficial interests, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) choses in action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this section, an interest in a partnership which has in effect a valid election under section 761(a) to be excluded from the application of all of subchapter K shall be treated as an interest in each of the assets of such partnership and not as an interest in a partnership.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Requirement that property be identified and that exchange be completed not more than 180 days after transfer of exchanged property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, any property received by the taxpayer shall be treated as property which is not like-kind property if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such property is not identified as property to be received in the exchange on or before the day which is 45 days after the date on which the taxpayer transfers the property relinquished in the exchange, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such property is received after the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the day which is 180 days after the date on which the taxpayer transfers the property relinquished in the exchange, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the due date (determined with regard to extension) for the transferor's return of the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the transfer of the relinquished property occurs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Gain from exchanges not solely in kind</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an exchange would be within the provisions of subsection (a), of section 1035(a), of section 1036(a), or of section 1037(a), if it were not for the fact that the property received in exchange consists not only of property permitted by such provisions to be received without the recognition of gain, but also of other property or money, then the gain, if any, to the recipient shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the sum of such money and the fair market value of such other property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Loss from exchanges not solely in kind</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an exchange would be within the provisions of subsection (a), of section 1035(a), of section 1036(a), or of section 1037(a), if it were not for the fact that the property received in exchange consists not only of property permitted by such provisions to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, but also of other property or money, then no loss from the exchange shall be recognized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If property was acquired on an exchange described in this section, section 1035(a), section 1036(a), or section 1037(a), then the basis shall be the same as that of the property exchanged, decreased in the amount of any money received by the taxpayer and increased in the amount of gain or decreased in the amount of loss to the taxpayer that was recognized on such exchange. If the property so acquired consisted in part of the type of property permitted by this section, section 1035(a), section 1036(a), or section 1037(a), to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, and in part of other property, the basis provided in this subsection shall be allocated between the properties (other than money) received, and for the purpose of the allocation there shall be assigned to such other property an amount equivalent to its fair market value at the date of the exchange.

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When so provided by regulations promulgated by the Secretary in connection with the issue of obligations of the United States, no gain or loss shall be recognized on the surrender to the United States of obligations of the United States issued under chapter 31 of title 31 in exchange solely for other obligations issued under such chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application of original issue discount rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Exchanges involving obligations issued at a discount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which gain has been realized but not recognized because of the provisions of subsection (a) (or so much of section 1031(b) as relates to subsection (a) of this section), to the extent such gain is later recognized by reason of a disposition or redemption of an obligation received in an exchange subject to such provisions, the first sentence of section 1271(c)(2) shall apply to such gain as though the obligation disposed of or redeemed were the obligation surrendered to the Government in the exchange rather than the obligation actually disposed of or redeemed. For purposes of this paragraph and subpart A of part V of subchapter P, if the obligation surrendered in the exchange is a nontransferable obligation described in subsection (a) or (c) of section 454&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the aggregate amount considered, with respect to the obligation surrendered, as ordinary income shall not exceed the difference between the issue price and the stated redemption price which applies at the time of the exchange, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the issue price of the obligation received in the exchange shall be considered to be the stated redemption price of the obligation surrendered in the exchange, increased by the amount of other consideration (if any) paid to the United States as a part of the exchange.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1746 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exchanges of transferable obligations issued at not less than par</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which subsection (a) (or so much of section 1031(b) or (c) as relates to subsection (a) of this section) has applied to the exchange of a transferable obligation which was issued at not less than par for another transferable obligation, the issue price of the obligation received from the Government in the exchange shall be considered for purposes of applying subpart A of part V of subchapter P to be the same as the issue price of the obligation surrendered to the Government in the exchange, increased by the amount of other consideration (if any) paid to the United States as a part of the exchange.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cross references</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>(1) For rules relating to the recognition of gain or loss in a case where subsection (a) would apply except for the fact that the exchange was not made solely for other obligations of the United States, see subsections (b) and (c) of section 1031.</strong></p>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>(2) For rules relating to the basis of obligations of the United States acquired in an exchange for other obligations described in subsection (a), see subsection (d) of section 1031.</strong></p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a sale of real property gives rise to indebtedness to the seller which is secured by the real property sold, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the seller of such property reacquires such property in partial or full satisfaction of such indebtedness,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then, except as provided in subsections (b) and (d), no gain or loss shall result to the seller from such reacquisition, and no debt shall become worthless or partially worthless as a result of such reacquisition.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount of gain resulting</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a reacquisition of real property to which subsection (a) applies, gain shall result from such reacquisition to the extent that&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of gain determined under paragraph (1) resulting from a reacquisition during any taxable year beginning after the date of the enactment of this section shall not exceed the amount by which the price at which the real property was sold exceeded its adjusted basis, reduced by the sum of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of money and the fair market value of other property (other than obligations of the purchaser received with respect to the sale of such property) paid or transferred by the seller in connection with the reacquisition of such property.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in this section, the gain determined under this subsection resulting from a reacquisition to which subsection (a) applies shall be recognized, notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such seller shall be considered as receiving, upon the reacquisition of such property, an amount equal to the amount of such indebtedness treated by him as having become worthless, and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Principal residences</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) within 1 year after the date of the reacquisition of such property by the seller, such property is resold by him,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for purposes of subsection (a), acquisition of real property by the taxpayer shall be treated as reacquisition by the seller, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the basis of the real property acquired by the taxpayer shall be increased by an amount equal to the deduction under section 691(c) which would (but for this subsection) have been allowable to the taxpayer with respect to the gain on the exchange of the obligation for the real property.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the transferee's basis in such assets, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the gain or loss of the transferor with respect to such acquisition,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">the consideration received for such assets shall be allocated among such assets acquired in such acquisition in the same manner as amounts are allocated to assets under section 338(b)(5). If in connection with an applicable asset acquisition, the transferee and transferor agree in writing as to the allocation of any consideration, or as to the fair market value of any of the assets, such agreement shall be binding on both the transferee and transferor unless the Secretary determines that such allocation (or fair market value) is not appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Information required to be furnished to Secretary</h4>

<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;10-percent owner&rdquo; means, with respect to any entity, any person who holds 10 percent or more (by value) of the interests in such entity immediately before the transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Constructive ownership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Section 318 shall apply in determining ownership of stock in a corporation. Similar principles shall apply in determining the ownership of interests in any other entity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Related person</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;related person&rdquo; means any person who is related (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)) to the 10-percent owner.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Exchanges of stock or securities only</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No gain or loss shall be recognized to the transferor if stock or securities in a corporation which is a registered holding company or a majority-owned subsidiary company are transferred to such corporation or to an associate company thereof which is a registered holding company or a majority-owned subsidiary company solely in exchange for stock or securities (other than stock or securities which are nonexempt property), and the exchange is made by the transferee corporation in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exchanges and sales of property by corporations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No gain shall be recognized to a transferor corporation which is a registered holding company or an associate company of a registered holding company, if such corporation, in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission, transfers property in exchange for property, and such order recites that such exchange by the transferor corporation is necessary or appropriate to the integration or simplification of the holding company system of which the transferor corporation is a member. Any gain, to the extent that it cannot be applied in reduction of basis under section 1082(a)(2), shall be recognized.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Nonexempt property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any such property so received is nonexempt property, gain shall be recognized unless such nonexempt property or an amount equal to the fair market value of such property at the time of the transfer is, within 24 months of the transfer, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, and in accordance with an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission, expended for property other than nonexempt property or is invested as a contribution to the capital, or as paid-in surplus, of another corporation, and such order recites that such expenditure or investment by the transferor corporation is necessary or appropriate to the integration or simplification of the holding company system of which the transferor corporation is a member. If the fair market value of such nonexempt property at the time of the transfer exceeds the amount expended and the amount invested, as required in the preceding sentence, the gain, if any, to the extent of such excess, shall be recognized.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Cancellation or redemption of stock or securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, a distribution in cancellation or redemption (except a distribution having the effect of a dividend) of the whole or a part of the transferor's own stock (not acquired on the transfer) and a payment in complete or partial retirement or cancellation of securities representing indebtedness of the transferor or a complete or partial <!-- PDFPage:1768 -->retirement or cancellation of such securities which is a part of the consideration for the transfer shall be considered an expenditure for property other than nonexempt property, and if, on the transfer, a liability of the transferor is assumed, or property of the transferor is transferred subject to a liability, the amount of such liability shall be considered to be an expenditure by the transferor for property other than nonexempt property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Consents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply unless the transferor corporation consents, at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe to the regulations prescribed under section 1082(a)(2) in effect at the time of filing its return for the taxable year in which the transfer occurs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Distribution of stock or securities only</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If there is distributed, in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to a shareholder in a corporation which is a registered holding company or a majority-owned subsidiary company, stock or securities (other than stock or securities which are nonexempt property), without the surrender by such shareholder of stock or securities in such corporation, no gain to the distributee from the receipt of the stock or securities so distributed shall be recognized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Transfers within system group</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No gain or loss shall be recognized to a corporation which is a member of a system group&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if such corporation transfers property to another corporation which is a member of the same system group in exchange for other property, and the exchange by each corporation is made in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if there is distributed to such corporation as a shareholder in a corporation which is a member of the same system group, property, without the surrender by such shareholder of stock or securities in the corporation making the distribution, and the distribution is made and received in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If an exchange by or a distribution to a corporation with respect to which no gain or loss is recognized under any of the provisions of this paragraph may also be considered to be within the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c), then the provisions of this paragraph only shall apply.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sales of stock or securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the property received on an exchange which is within any of the provisions of paragraph (1) consists in whole or in part of stock or securities issued by the corporation from which such property was received, and if in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission such stock or securities (other than stock which is not preferred as to both dividends and assets) are sold and the proceeds derived therefrom are applied in whole or in part in the retirement or cancellation of stock or of securities of the recipient corporation outstanding at the time of such exchange, no gain or loss shall be recognized to the recipient corporation on the sale of the stock or securities with respect to which such order was made; except that if any part of the proceeds derived from the sale of such stock or securities is not so applied, or if the amount of such proceeds is in excess of the fair market value of such stock or securities at the time of such exchange, the gain, if any, shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the proceeds which are not so applied, or in an amount not more than the amount by which the proceeds derived from such sale exceed such fair market value, whichever is the greater.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exchanges not solely in kind</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an exchange (not within any of the provisions of subsection (d)) would be within the provisions of subsection (a) if it were not for the fact that property received in exchange consists not only of property permitted by such subsection to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, but also of other property or money, then the gain, if any, to the recipient shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the sum of such money and the fair market value of such other property, and the loss, if any, to the recipient shall not be recognized.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Distribution treated as dividend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an exchange is within the provisions of paragraph (1) and if it includes a distribution which has the effect of the distribution of a taxable dividend, then there shall be taxed as a dividend to each distributee such an amount of the gain recognized under such paragraph as is not in excess of his ratable share of the undistributed earnings and profits of the corporation accumulated after February 28, 1913. The remainder, if any, of the gain recognized under paragraph (1) shall be taxed as a gain from the exchange of property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Conditions for application of section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section shall not apply to an exchange, expenditure, investment, distribution, or sale unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the order of the Securities and Exchange Commission in obedience to which such exchange, expenditure, investment, distribution, or sale was made recites that such exchange, expenditure, investment, distribution, or sale is necessary or appropriate to effectuate the provisions of section 11(b) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79k(b)),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such order specifies and itemizes the stock and securities and other property which are ordered to be acquired, transferred, received, or sold on such exchange, acquisition, expenditure, distribution, or sale, and, in the case of an investment, the investment to be made, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such exchange, acquisition, expenditure, investment, distribution, or sale was made in obedience to such order, and was completed within the time prescribed therefor.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1769 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Nonapplication of other provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an exchange or distribution made in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission is within any of the provisions of this part and may also be considered to be within any of the other provisions of this subchapter or subchapter C (sec. 301 and following, relating to corporate distributions and adjustments), then the provisions of this part only shall apply.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Exchanges generally</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Exchanges subject to the provisions of section 1081(a) or (e)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the property was acquired on an exchange subject to the provisions of section 1081(a) or (e), or the corresponding provisions of prior internal revenue laws, the basis shall be the same as in the case of the property exchanged, decreased in the amount of any money received by the taxpayer, and increased in the amount of gain or decreased in the amount of loss to the taxpayer that was recognized on such exchange under the law applicable to the year in which the exchange was made. If the property so acquired consisted in part of the type of property permitted by section 1081(a) to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, and in part of nonexempt property, the basis provided in this subsection shall be allocated between the properties (other than money) received, and for the purpose of the allocation there shall be assigned to such nonexempt property (other than money) an amount equivalent to its fair market value at the date of the exchange. This subsection shall not apply to property acquired by a corporation by the issuance of its stock or securities as the consideration in whole or in part for the transfer of the property to it.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exchanges subject to the provisions of section 1081(b)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The gain not recognized on a transfer by reason of section 1081(b) or the corresponding provisions of prior internal revenue laws shall be applied to reduce the basis for determining gain or loss on sale or exchange of the following categories of property in the hands of the transferor immediately after the transfer, and property acquired within 24 months after such transfer by an expenditure or investment to which section 1081(b) relates on account of the acquisition of which gain is not recognized under such subsection, in the following order:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) property of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) property (not described in subparagraph (A)) with respect to which a deduction for amortization is allowable under section 169;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) property with respect to which a deduction for depletion is allowable under section 611 but not allowable under section 613;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) stock and securities of corporations not members of the system group of which the transferor is a member (other than stock or securities of a corporation of which the transferor is a subsidiary);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) securities (other than stock) of corporations which are members of the system group of which the transferor is a member (other than securities of the transferor or of a corporation of which the transferor is a subsidiary);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) stock of corporations which are members of the system group of which the transferor is a member (other than stock of the transferor or of a corporation of which the transferor is a subsidiary);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) all other remaining property of the transferor (other than stock or securities of the transferor or of a corporation of which the transferor is a subsidiary).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The manner and amount of the reduction to be applied to particular property within any of the categories described in subparagraphs (A) to (G), inclusive, shall be determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Basis in case of pre-1942 acquisition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) or (2), if the property was acquired in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1942, in any manner described in section 372 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 before its amendment by the Revenue Act of 1942, the basis shall be that prescribed in such section (before its amendment by such Act) with respect to such property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Transfers to corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, in connection with a transfer subject to the provisions of section 1081(a), (b), or (e) or the corresponding provisions of prior internal revenue laws, the property was acquired by a corporation, either as paid-in surplus or as a contribution to capital, or in consideration for stock or securities issued by the corporation receiving the property (including cases where part of the consideration for the transfer of such property to the corporation consisted of prop<!-- PDFPage:1770 -->erty or money in addition to such stock or securities), then the basis shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor, increased in the amount of gain or decreased in the amount of loss recognized to the transferor on such transfer under the law applicable to the year in which the transfer was made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Distributions of stock or securities</h4>
