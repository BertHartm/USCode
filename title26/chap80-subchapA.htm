<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) While the budget for the Internal Revenue Service (hereafter referred to as the &lsquo;IRS&rsquo;) has risen from $2.5 billion in fiscal year 1979 to $7.3 billion in fiscal year 1996, tax returns processing has not become significantly faster, tax collection rates have not significantly increased, and the accuracy and timeliness of taxpayer assistance has not significantly improved.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) To date, the Tax Systems Modernization (TSM) program has cost the taxpayers $2.5 billion, with an estimated cost of $8 billion. Despite this investment, modernization efforts were recently described by the GAO as &lsquo;chaotic&rsquo; and &lsquo;ad hoc&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) While the IRS maintains that TSM will increase efficiency and thus revenues, Congress has had to appropriate additional funds in recent years for compliance initiatives in order to increase tax revenues.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Because TSM has not been implemented, the IRS continues to rely on paper returns, processing a total of 14 billion pieces of paper every tax season. This results in an extremely inefficient system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) This lack of efficiency reduces the level of customer service and impedes the ability of the IRS to collect revenue.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The present status of the IRS shows the need for the establishment of a Commission which will examine the organization of IRS and recommend actions to expedite the implementation of TSM and improve service to taxpayers.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Composition of the Commission.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
