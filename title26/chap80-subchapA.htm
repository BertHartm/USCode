<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 104&ndash;52, title VI, &sect;637, Nov. 19, 1995, 109 Stat. 509, as amended by Pub. L. 104&ndash;134, title II, &sect;2904(a), <!-- PDFPage:2903 -->Apr. 26, 1996, 110 Stat. 1321&ndash;333; Pub. L. 104&ndash;208, Div. A, title I, &sect;101(f) [title VI, &sect;643(a)&ndash;(e)], Sept. 30, 1996, 110 Stat. 3009&ndash;314, 3009&ndash;365, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) While the budget for the Internal Revenue Service (hereafter referred to as the &lsquo;IRS&rsquo;) has risen from $2.5 billion in fiscal year 1979 to $7.3 billion in fiscal year 1996, tax returns processing has not become significantly faster, tax collection rates have not significantly increased, and the accuracy and timeliness of taxpayer assistance has not significantly improved.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) To date, the Tax Systems Modernization (TSM) program has cost the taxpayers $2.5 billion, with an estimated cost of $8 billion. Despite this investment, modernization efforts were recently described by the GAO as &lsquo;chaotic&rsquo; and &lsquo;ad hoc&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) While the IRS maintains that TSM will increase efficiency and thus revenues, Congress has had to appropriate additional funds in recent years for compliance initiatives in order to increase tax revenues.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Because TSM has not been implemented, the IRS continues to rely on paper returns, processing a total of 14 billion pieces of paper every tax season. This results in an extremely inefficient system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) This lack of efficiency reduces the level of customer service and impedes the ability of the IRS to collect revenue.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The present status of the IRS shows the need for the establishment of a Commission which will examine the organization of IRS and recommend actions to expedite the implementation of TSM and improve service to taxpayers.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Composition of the Commission.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Establishment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To carry out the purposes of this section, there is established a National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service (in this section referred to as the &lsquo;Commission&rsquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Composition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Commission shall be composed of seventeen members, as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) Five members appointed by the President, two from the executive branch of the Government, two from private life, and one from an organization that represents a substantial number of Internal Revenue Service employees.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) Four members appointed by the Majority Leader of the Senate, one from Members of the Senate and three from private life.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) Two members appointed by the Minority Leader of the Senate, one from Members of the Senate and one from private life.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) Four members appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, one from Members of the House of Representatives and three from private life.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) Two members appointed by the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, one from Members of the House of Representatives and one from private life.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service shall be an ex officio member of the Commission.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) <cap-smallcap>Co-Chairs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Commission shall elect Co-Chairs from among its members.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) <cap-smallcap>Meeting; quorum; vacancies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After its initial meeting, the Commission shall meet upon the call of the Co-Chairs or a majority of its members. Nine members of the Commission shall constitute a quorum. Any vacancy in the Commission shall not affect its powers, but shall be filled in the same manner in which the original appointment was made.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) <cap-smallcap>Appointment; initial meeting.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) <cap-smallcap>Appointment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of the Congress that members of the Committee [Commission] should be appointed not more than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this section [Nov. 19, 1995].</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) <cap-smallcap>Initial meeting</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, after 60 days from the date of the enactment of this section, seven or more members of the Commission have been appointed, members who have been appointed may meet and select Co-Chairs who thereafter shall have the authority to begin the operations of the Commission, including the hiring of staff.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Functions of Commission.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The functions of the Commission shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) to conduct, for a period of not to exceed 15 months from the date of its first meeting, the review described in paragraph (2), and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) to submit to the Congress a final report of the results of the review, including recommendations for restructuring the IRS.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Commission shall review&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the present practices of the IRS, especially with respect to&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(iv) the collection process;</p>

<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(ii) modernizing IRS operations;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(iii) improving the collections process without major personnel increases or increased funding;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(iv) improving taxpayer accounts management;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(v) improving the accuracy of information requested by taxpayers in order to file their returns; and</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(vi) changing the culture of the IRS to make the organization more efficient, productive, and customer-oriented;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) whether the IRS could be replaced with a quasi-governmental agency with tangible incentives and internally managing its programs and activities and for modernizing its activities, and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) whether the IRS could perform other collection, information, and financial service functions of the Federal Government.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the Internal Revenue Service estimates that the amount of taxes owed for 1986 will exceed the amount of taxes collected for such year by $100 billion;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the current taxpayer compliance rate stands at 81.5 percent;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the tax gap can be significantly reduced by enhancing taxpayer assistance services and enforcement; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the Appropriations Committee of the House of Representatives, in its fiscal year 1988 Internal Revenue Service appropriation, took a step in the direction of providing additional funding for taxpayer assistance and enforcement efforts.</p>

The net revenue increase would be $2.5 billion in fiscal year 1989 and $3.6 billion in fiscal year 1990, or a net revenue increase over the House Appropriations Committee recommendations of $.4 billion in fiscal year 1989 and $1.3 billion in fiscal year 1990.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Internal Revenue Service offer improved taxpayer assistance and enforcement efforts by using the aforementioned outlays in areas recommended by, or consistent with the recommendations of, the &lsquo;Dorgan Task Force Report&rsquo;.

Taxpayer enforcement efforts would include raising the audit rate from 1.1 percent toward 2.5 percent, restoring resources to criminal investigations, and the collection of delinquent accounts.</p>

<p class="note-body">There are transferred to the Secretary of the Treasury the functions, if any, that have been vested by statute in officers, agencies, or employees of the Bureau of Internal Revenue of the Department of the Treasury since the effective date of Reorganization Plan Numbered 26 of 1950 (15 F.R. 4935) [set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees].</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1952, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949 and providing for reorganizations in the Bureau of Internal Revenue of the Department of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="note-body">A comprehensive reorganization of that Bureau is necessary both to increase the efficiency of its operations and to provide better machinery for assuring honest and impartial administration of the internal revenue laws. The reorganization plan transmitted with this message is essential to accomplish the basic changes in the structure of the Bureau of Internal Revenue which are necessary for the kind of comprehensive reorganization that is now required.</p>
<p class="note-body">By bringing additional personnel in the Bureau of Internal Revenue under the merit system, Reorganization Plan No. 1 likewise removes what the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government described as &ldquo;one of the chief handicaps to effective organization of the Department * * *.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">It is my determination to maintain the highest standards of integrity and efficiency in the Federal service. While those standards have been observed faithfully by all but a relatively few public servants, the betrayal of their trust by those few demands the strongest corrective action.</p>
<p class="note-body">The most vigorous efforts are being and will continue to be made to expose and punish every Government employee who misuses his official position. But we must do even more than this. We must correct every defect in organization that contributes to inefficient management and thus affords the opportunity for improper conduct.</p>
<p class="note-body">The thorough reorganization of the Bureau of Internal Revenue which I propose will be of great help in accomplishing all of these ends. It is an integral part of a program to prevent improper conduct in public service, to protect the Government from insidious influence peddlers and favor seekers, to expose and punish wrong-doers, and to improve the management and efficiency of the executive branch.</p>
<p class="note-body">I am confident that the Congress and the public are as deeply and earnestly concerned as I am that the public business be conducted entirely upon a basis of fairness, integrity, and efficiency. I therefore hope that the Congress will give speedy approval to Reorganization Plan No. 1, in order that we may move ahead rapidly in to achieving the reorganization of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.</p>
<p class="note-body">The task of collecting the internal revenue has expanded enormously within the past decade. This expansion has been occasioned by the necessary additional taxation brought on by World War II and essential post-war programs. In fiscal year 1940, tax collections made by the Bureau of Internal Revenue were slightly over 51/3 billions of dollars; in 1951, they totaled almost 501/2 billions. In 1940, 19 million tax returns were filed; in 1951, 82 million. In 1940, there were 22,000 employees working for the Bureau; in 1951, there were 57,000.</p>
<p class="note-body">Throughout this tremendous growth, the structure of the revenue-collecting organization has remained substantially unchanged. The present field structure of the Bureau of Internal Revenue is comprised of more than 200 field offices which report directly to Washington. Those 200 offices carry out their functions through more than 2,000 suboffices and posts of duty throughout the country. The Washington office now provides operating supervision, guidance, and control over the principal field offices through 10 separate divisions, thus further adding to the complexities of administration.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since the end of World War II, many procedural improvements have been made in the Bureau's operations. The use of automatic machines has been greatly increased. The handling of cases has been simplified. One major advance is represented by the recently completed arrangements to expedite criminal prosecutions in tax-fraud cases. In these cases, field representatives of the Bureau of Internal Revenue will make recommendations for criminal prosecutions directly to the Department of Justice. These procedural changes have increased the Bureau's efficiency and have made it possible for the Bureau to carry its enormously increased workload. However, improvements in procedure cannot meet the need for organizational changes.</p>
<p class="note-body">Part of the authority necessary to make a comprehensive reorganization was provided in Reorganization Plan No. 26 of 1950, which was one of several uniform plans giving department heads fuller authority over internal organizations throughout their departments. The studies of the Secretary of the Treasury have culminated since that time in a plan for extensive reorganization and modernization of the Bureau. However, his existing authority is not broad enough to permit him to effectuate all of the basic features of the plan he has developed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The principal barrier to effective organization and administration of the Bureau of Internal Revenue which plan No. 1 removes is the archaic statutory office of collector of internal revenue. Since the collectors are not appointed and cannot be removed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or the Secretary of the Treasury and since the collectors must accommodate themselves to local political situations, they are not fully responsive to the control of their superiors in the Treasury Department. Residence requirements prevent moving a collector from one collection district to another, either to promote impartiality and fairness or to advance collectors to more important positions. Uncertainties of tenure add to the difficulty of attracting to such offices persons who are well versed in the intricacies of the revenue laws and possessed of broadgaged administrative ability.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is appropriate and desirable that major political offices in the executive branch of the Government be filled by persons who are appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. On the other hand, the technical nature of much of the Government's work today makes it equally appropriate and desirable that positions of other types be in the professional career service. The administration of our internal-revenue laws at the local level calls for positions in the latter category.</p>
<p class="note-body">Instead of the present organization built around the offices of politically appointed collectors of internal revenue, plan No. 1 will make it possible for the Secretary of the Treasury to establish not to exceed 25 district offices. Each of these offices will be headed by a district commissioner who will be responsible to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and will have full responsibility for administering all internal-revenue activities within a designated area. In addition, all essential collection, enforcement, and appellate functions can be provided for in each local area and under one roof so far as is practicable. It is not proposed to discontinue any essential facilities which now exist in any local areas. Rather, the facilities will be extended and the service to taxpayers improved. These new arrangements should make it possible for the individual taxpayer to conduct his business with the Bureau much more conveniently and expeditiously.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition to making possible greatly improved service to the taxpayer, the establishment of the district offices will provide opportunity in the field service of the Bureau of Internal Revenue for the development of high-caliber administrators with experience in all phases of revenue administration. These offices will be the backbone of a modern, streamlined pattern of organization and operations with clear and direct channels <!-- PDFPage:2911 -->of responsibility and supervision from the lowest field office to the Commissioner, and through him to the Secretary of the Treasury. The creation of this new framework of district offices is a necessary step in carrying out the overall reorganization of the Bureau.</p>
<p class="note-body">Plan No. 1 also makes it possible to provide a new framework of supervisory offices in the headquarters of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Under plan No. 1, the offices of Deputy Commissioner, Special Deputy Commissioner, and Assistant Commissioner are abolished. Three Assistant Commissioners, all in the classified civil service, are authorized, and will be available, to perform such functions as may be assigned to them. The intention of the Secretary of the Treasury under the comprehensive reorganization is to utilize one Assistant Commissioner to assist the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in supervising the operations of the district offices, another Assistant Commissioner to aid in the preparation of technical rulings and decisions, and the third Assistant Commissioner to supervise for the Commissioner the inspection activities of the Bureau.</p>
<p class="note-body">Two additional advantages will be obtained when the reorganization around this new framework is completed.</p>
<p class="note-body">First, the strong inspection service which the Secretary is establishing will keep the work of the Bureau under close and continuous observation. Working under the direct control of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, it will be responsible for promptly detecting and investigating any irregularities.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, the new pattern of organization will strengthen and clarify lines of responsibility throughout the Bureau, thus simplifying and making more effective and uniform the management control of the organization. This is essential in any effort to provide our principal revenue collection agency the best possible administration.</p>
<p class="note-body">In order to eliminate Presidential appointment and senatorial confirmation with respect to the Assistant General Counsel for the Bureau of Internal Revenue, and in order to provide a method of appointment comparable to that obtaining in the case of other assistant general counsel of the Department of the Treasury, plan No. 1 abolishes that office and provides in lieu thereof a new office of Assistant General Counsel with appointment under the classified civil service.</p>
<p class="note-body">The success of the reorganization of the Bureau of Internal Revenue will to a considerable extent depend upon the ability to attract the best qualified persons to the key positions throughout the Bureau. In order to do so, it is necessary to make provision for more adequate salaries for such key positions. Plan No. 1 establishes in the Bureau of Internal Revenue a maximum of 70 offices with titles determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. Those offices are in addition to the offices with specific titles also provided for in plan No. 1 and to any positions established under other authority vested in the Department of the Treasury. The compensation of these officials will be fixed under the Classification Act of 1949, as amended, but without regard to the numerical limitations on positions set forth in section 505 of that act. This provision will enable the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission, or the President, as the case may be, to fix rates of pay for those offices in excess of the rates established in the Classification Act of 1949 for grade GS&ndash;15 whenever the standards of the classification laws so permit.</p>
<p class="note-body">All organizational changes under plan No. 1 will be put into effect as soon as it is possible to do so without disrupting the continued collection of revenue. Plan No. 1 will in any event be effective in its entirety no later than December 1, 1952.</p>
<p class="note-body">The taking effect of the reorganizations provided for in Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1952 will make possible many benefits in improved organization and operations which may be expected to produce substantial savings in future years. Those savings should not be expected to be reflected in an immediate reduction in expenditure by the Bureau of Internal Revenue but in an improved service to the public and a more efficient collection of revenue.</p>
<p class="note-body">It should be emphasized that abolition by plan No. 1 of the offices of collectors and others will in no way prejudice any right or potential right of any taxpayer. The abolition of offices by plan No. 1 will not abolish any rights, privileges, powers, duties, immunities, liabilities, obligations, or other attributes of those offices except as they relate to matters of appointment, tenure, and compensation inconsistent with plan No. 1. Under the Reorganization Act of 1949, all of these attributes of office will attach to the office to which the functions of the abolished office are delegated by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="note-body">After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1952 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body">I have found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying Reorganization Plan No. 1, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of the officers specified therein. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are not in excess of those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch.</p>
<p class="note-body">I cannot emphasize too strongly the importance which should be attached to the reorganization plan that I am now transmitting to the Congress. The fair and efficient administration of the Federal internal-revenue laws is of vital concern to every citizen. All of us have a right to insist that the Bureau of Internal Revenue be provided with the finest organization that can be devised. All of us are entitled to have that organization manned by personnel who get their jobs and keep them solely because of their own integrity and competence. This reorganization plan will be a major step in achieving those objectives.</p>
