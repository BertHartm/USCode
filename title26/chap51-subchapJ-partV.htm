<p class="statutory-body">Any person who shall carry on a business subject to a special tax imposed by part II of subchapter A or section 5276 (relating to occupational taxes) and willfully fail to pay the special tax as required by law, shall be fined not more than $5,000, or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both, for each such offense.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Presumption in case of the sale of 20 wine gallons or more</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this chapter, the sale, or offer for sale, of distilled spirits, wines, or beer, in quantities of 20 wine gallons or more to the same person at the same time, shall be presumptive evidence that the person making such sale, or offer for sale, is engaged in or carrying on the business of a wholesale dealer in liquors or a wholesale dealer in beer, as the case may be. Such presumption may be overcome by evidence satisfactorily showing that such sale, or offer for sale, was made to a person other than a dealer, as defined in section 5112(a).</p>
