<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A multiemployer plan is in reorganization for a plan year if the plan's reorganization index for that year is greater than zero.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reorganization index</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subpart&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A plan's reorganization index for any plan year is the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the vested benefits charge for such year, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the net charge to the funding standard account for such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Net charge to funding standard account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The net charge to the funding standard account for any plan year is the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the charges to the funding standard account for such year under section 412(b)(2), over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the credits to the funding standard account under section 412(b)(3)(B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Vested benefits charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The vested benefits charge for any plan year is the amount which would be necessary to amortize the plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the base plan year in equal annual installments&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) over 10 years, to the extent such benefits are attributable to persons in pay status, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) over 25 years, to the extent such benefits are attributable to other participants.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Determination of vested benefits charge</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The vested benefits charge for a plan year shall be based on an actuarial valuation of the plan as of the end of the base plan year, adjusted to reflect&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) decrease of 5 percent or more in the value of plan assets, or increase of 5 percent or more in the number of persons in pay status, during the period beginning on the first day of the plan year following the base plan year and ending on the adjustment date, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) at the election of the plan sponsor, actuarial valuation of the plan as of the adjustment date or any later date not later than the last day of the plan year for which the determination is being made,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any change in benefits under the plan which is not otherwise taken into account under this subparagraph and which is pursuant to any amendment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) adopted before the end of the plan year for which the determination is being made, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) effective after the end of the base plan year and on or before the end of the plan year referred to in subclause (I), and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) any other event (including an event described in subparagraph (B)(i)(I)) which, as determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, would substantially increase the plan's vested benefit charge.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certain changes in benefit levels</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In determining the vested benefits charge for a plan year following a plan year in which the plan was not in reorganization, any change in benefits which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) results from the changing of a group of participants from one benefit level to another benefit level under a schedule of plan benefits as a result of changes in a collective bargaining agreement, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) results from any other change in a collective bargaining agreement,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;shall not be taken into account except to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Plan in reorganization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as otherwise determined by the Secretary, in determining the vested bene<!-- PDFPage:939 -->fits charge for any plan year following any plan year in which the plan was in reorganization, any change in benefits&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) described in clause (i)(I), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) described in clause (i)(II) as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;shall, for purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), be treated as a change in benefits pursuant to an amendment to a plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Base plan year</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The base plan year for any plan year is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if there is a relevant collective bargaining agreement, the last plan year ending at least 6 months before the relevant effective date, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if there is no relevant collective bargaining agreement, the last plan year ending at least 12 months before the beginning of the plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Relevant collective bargaining agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A relevant collective bargaining agreement is a collective bargaining agreement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) which is in effect for at least 6 months during the plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) which has not been in effect for more than 36 months as of the end of the plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Relevant effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The relevant effective date is the earliest of the effective dates for the relevant collective bargaining agreements.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Person in pay status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;person in pay status&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a participant or beneficiary on the last day of the base plan year who, at any time during such year, was paid an early, late, normal, or disability retirement benefit (or a death benefit related to a retirement benefit), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, any other person who is entitled to such a benefit under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Other definitions and special rules</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Unfunded vested benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;unfunded vested benefits&rdquo; means, in connection with a plan, an amount (determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary) equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the value of vested benefits under the plan, less</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the value of the assets of the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Vested benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;vested benefits&rdquo; means any nonforfeitable benefit (within the meaning of section 4001(a)(8) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Allocation of assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining the plan's unfunded vested benefits, plan assets shall first be allocated to the vested benefits attributable to persons in pay status.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Treatment of certain benefit reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The vested benefits charge shall be determined without regard to reductions in accrued benefits under section 418D which are first effective in the plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Withdrawal liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this part, any outstanding claim for withdrawal liability shall not be considered a plan asset, except as otherwise provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prohibition of nonannuity payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, while a plan is in reorganization a benefit with respect to a participant (other than a death benefit) which is attributable to employer contributions and which has a value of more than $1,750 may not be paid in a form other than an annuity which (by itself or in combination with social security, railroad retirement, or workers&rsquo; compensation benefits) provides substantially level payments over the life of the participant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Terminated plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any multiemployer plan which terminates under section 4041A(a)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 shall not be considered in reorganization after the last day of the plan year in which the plan is treated as having terminated.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Accumulated funding deficiency in reorganization</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any plan year in which a multiemployer plan is in reorganization&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the plan shall continue to maintain its funding standard account, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the plan's accumulated funding deficiency under section 412(a) for such plan year shall be equal to the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the sum of the minimum contribution requirement for such plan year (taking into account any overburden credit under section 418C(a)) plus the plan's accumulated funding deficiency for the preceding plan year (determined under this section if the plan was in reorganization during such plan year or under section 412(a) if the plan was not in reorganization), over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) amounts considered contributed by employers to or under the plan for the plan year (increased by any amount waived under subsection (f) for the plan year).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of withdrawal liability payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), withdrawal liability payments (whether or not received) which are due with respect to withdrawals before the end of the base plan year shall be considered amounts contributed by the employer to or under the plan if, as of the adjustment date, it was reasonable for the plan sponsor to anticipate that such payments would be made during the plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Minimum contribution requirement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this section for purposes of this subpart the minimum contribution requirement for a plan year in which a plan is in reorganization is an amount equal to the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the plan's vested benefits charge for the plan year; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of the overburden credit (if any) determined under section 418C for the plan year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustment for reductions in contribution base units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the plan's current contribution base for the plan year is less than the plan's valuation contribution base for the plan year, the minimum contribution requirement for such plan year shall be equal to the product of the amount determined under paragraph (1) (after any adjustment required by this subpart other than this paragraph) multiplied by a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the numerator of which is the plan's current contribution base for the plan year, and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Current contribution base; valuation contribution base</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Current contribution base</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subpart, a plan's current contribution base for a plan year is the number of contribution base units with respect to which contributions are required to be made under the plan for that plan year, determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Valuation contribution base</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), for purposes of this subpart a plan's valuation contribution base is the number of contribution base units for which contributions were received for the base plan year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) adjusted to reflect declines in the contribution base which have occurred (or could reasonably be anticipated) as of the adjustment date for the plan year referred to in paragraph (1),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) adjusted upward (in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary) for any contribution base reduction in the base plan year caused by a strike or lockout or by unusual events, such as fire, earthquake, or severe weather conditions, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) adjusted (in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary) for reductions in the contribution base resulting from transfers of liabilities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Insolvent plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For any plan year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in which the plan is insolvent (within the meaning of section 418E(b)(1)), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) beginning with the first plan year beginning after the expiration of all relevant collective bargaining agreements which were in effect in the plan year in which the plan became insolvent,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the plan's valuation contribution base is the greater of the number of contribution base units for which contributions were received for the first or second plan year preceding the first plan year in which the plan is insolvent, adjusted as provided in clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Contribution base unit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subpart, the term &ldquo;contribution base unit&rdquo; means a unit with respect to which an employer has an obligation to contribute under a multiemployer plan (as defined in regulations prescribed by the Secretary).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;418C. Overburden credit against minimum contribution requirement</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining the contribution under section 418B (before the application of section 418B(b)(2) or (d)), the plan sponsor of a plan which is overburdened for the plan year shall apply an overburden credit against the plan's minimum contribution requirement for the plan year (determined without regard to section 418B(b)(2) or (d) and without regard to this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definition of overburdened plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A plan is overburdened for a plan year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the average number of pay status participants under the plan in the base plan year exceeds the average of the number of active participants in the base plan year and the 2 plan years preceding the base plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the rate of employer contributions under the plan equals or exceeds the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such rate for the preceding plan year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such rate for the plan year preceding the first year in which the plan is in reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount of overburden credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of the overburden credit for a plan year is the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) one-half of the average guaranteed benefit paid for the base plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the overburden factor for the plan year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The amount of the overburden credit for a plan year shall not exceed the amount of the minimum contribution requirement for such year (determined without regard to this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Overburden factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the overburden factor of a plan for the plan year is an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:943 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the average number of pay status participants for the base plan year, reduced by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the average of the number of active participants for the base plan year and for each of the 2 plan years preceding the base plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Pay status participant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;pay status participant&rdquo; means, with respect to a plan, a participant receiving retirement benefits under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Number of active participants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The number of active participants for a plan year shall be the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number of active employees who are participants in the plan and on whose behalf contributions are required to be made during the plan year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of active employees who are not participants in the plan but who are in an employment unit covered by a collective bargaining agreement which requires the employees&rsquo; employer to contribute to the plan unless service in such employment unit was never covered under the plan or a predecessor thereof, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the total number of active employees attributed to employers who made payments to the plan for the plan year of withdrawal liability pursuant to part 1 of subtitle E of title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, determined by dividing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the total amount of such payments, by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount equal to the total contributions received by the plan during the plan year divided by the average number of active employees who were participants in the plan during the plan year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Secretary shall by regulations provide alternative methods of determining active participants where (by reason of irregular employment, contributions on a unit basis, or otherwise) this paragraph does not yield a representative basis for determining the credit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Average number</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;average number&rdquo; means, with respect to pay status participants for a plan year, a number equal to one-half the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number with respect to the plan as of the beginning of the plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number with respect to the plan as of the end of the plan year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Average guaranteed benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The average guaranteed benefit paid is 12 times the average monthly pension payment guaranteed under section 4022A(c)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 determined under the provisions of the plan in effect at the beginning of the first plan year in which the plan is in reorganization and without regard to section 4022A(c)(2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) First year in reorganization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The first year in which the plan is in reorganization is the first of a period of 1 or more consecutive plan years in which the plan has been in reorganization not taking into account any plan years the plan was in reorganization prior to any period of 3 or more consecutive plan years in which the plan was not in reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) No overburden credit in case of certain reductions in contributions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a plan is not eligible for an overburden credit for a plan year if the Secretary finds that the plan's current contribution base for any plan year was reduced, without a corresponding reduction in the plan's unfunded vested benefits attributable to pay status participants, as a result of a change in an agreement providing for employer contributions under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of certain withdrawals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a complete or partial withdrawal of an employer (within the meaning of part 1 of subtitle E of title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) does not impair a plan's eligibility for an overburden credit, unless the Secretary finds that a contribution base reduction described in paragraph (1) resulted from a transfer of liabilities to another plan in connection with the withdrawal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Mergers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if 2 or more multiemployer plans merge, the amount of the overburden credit which may be applied under this section with respect to the plan resulting from the merger for any of the 3 plan years ending after the effective date of the merger shall not exceed the sum of the used overburden credit for each of the merging plans for its last plan year ending before the effective date of the merger. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the used overburden credit is that portion of the credit which does not exceed the excess of the minimum contribution requirement determined without regard to any overburden credit under this section over the employer contributions required under the plan.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding section 411, a multiemployer plan in reorganization may be amend<!-- PDFPage:944 -->ed, in accordance with this section, to reduce or eliminate accrued benefits attributable to employer contributions which, under section 4022A(b) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, are not eligible for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's guarantee. The preceding sentence shall only apply to accrued benefits under plan amendments (or plans) adopted after March 26, 1980, or under collective bargaining agreement entered into after March 26, 1980.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustment of vested benefits charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the minimum contribution requirement with respect to a plan for a plan year under section 418B(b), the vested benefits charge may be adjusted to reflect a plan amendment reducing benefits under this section or section 412(c)(8), but only if the amendment is adopted and effective no later than 21/2 months after the end of the plan year, or within such extended period as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations under section 412(c)(10).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Benefit increases and benefit restorations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, in the case of a plan which has been amended under this section to reduce accrued benefits&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an increase in a benefit, or in the rate of future benefit accruals, shall be considered a benefit increase to the extent that the benefit, or the accrual rate, is thereby increased above the highest benefit level, or accrual rate, which was in effect under the terms of the plan before the effective date of the amendment reducing accrued benefits, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an increase in a benefit, or in the rate of future benefit accruals, shall be considered a benefit restoration to the extent that the benefit, or the accrual rate, <!-- PDFPage:945 -->is not thereby increased above the highest benefit level, or accrual rate, which was in effect under the terms of the plan immediately before the effective date of the amendment reducing accrued benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Uniformity in benefit restoration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a plan is amended to partially restore previously reduced accrued benefit levels, or the rate of future benefit accruals, the benefits of inactive participants shall be restored in at least the same proportions as other accrued benefits which are restored.</p>
