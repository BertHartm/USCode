<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Clause (i) shall not apply to a plan unless the plan provides that any accrued benefit forfeited under a plan provision described in such clause shall be restored upon repayment by the participant of the full amount of the withdrawal described in such clause plus, in the case of a defined benefit plan, interest. Such interest shall be computed on such amount at the rate determined for purposes of subsection (c)(2)(C) on the date of such repayment (computed annually from the date of such withdrawal).

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if a separate account is not maintained with respect to an employee's contributions under such a plan, the amount which bears the same ratio to his total accrued benefit as the total amount of the employee's contributions (less withdrawals) bears to the sum of such contributions and the contributions made on his behalf by the employer (less withdrawals).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Defined benefit plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a defined benefit plan, the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee as of any applicable date is the amount equal to the employee's accumulated contributions expressed as an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, using an interest rate which would be used under the plan under section 417(e)(3) (as of the determination date).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Definition of accumulated contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;accumulated contribution&rdquo; means the total of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) at the rate of 120 percent of the Federal mid-term rate (as in effect under section 1274 for the 1st month of a plan year) for the period beginning with the 1st plan year to which subsection (a)(2) applies (by reason of the applicable effective date) and ending with the date on which the determination is being made, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) at the interest rate which would be used under the plan under section 417(e)(3) (as of the determination date) for the period beginning with the determination date and ending on the date on which the employee attains normal retirement age.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;mandatory contributions&rdquo; means amounts contributed to the plan by the employee which are required as a condition of employment, as a condition of participation in such plan, or as a condition of obtaining benefits under the plan attributable to employer contributions.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary is authorized to adjust by regulation the conversion factor described in subparagraph (B) from time to time as he may deem necessary. No such adjustment shall be effective for a plan year beginning before the expiration of 1 year after such adjustment is determined and published.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Actuarial adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, in the case of any defined benefit plan, if an employee's accrued benefit is to be determined as an amount other than an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, or if the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee is to be determined with respect to a benefit other than an annual benefit in the form of a single life annuity (without ancillary benefits) commencing at normal retirement age, the employee's accrued benefit, or the accrued benefits derived from contributions made by an employee, as the case may be, shall be the actuarial equivalent of such benefit or amount determined under paragraph (1) or (2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Coordination with section 401(a)(4)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A plan which satisfies the requirements of this section shall be treated as satisfying any vesting requirements resulting from the application of section 401(a)(4) unless&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1171 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) there has been a pattern of abuse under the plan (such as a dismissal of employees before their accrued benefits become nonforfeitable) tending to discriminate in favor of employees who are highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there have been, or there is reason to believe there will be, an accrual of benefits or forfeitures tending to discriminate in favor of employees who are highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prohibited discrimination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (a) shall not apply to benefits which may not be provided for designated employees in the event of early termination of the plan under provisions of the plan adopted pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary to preclude the discrimination prohibited by section 401(a)(4).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Termination or partial termination; discontinuance of contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), a trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under section 401(a) unless the plan of which such trust is a part provides that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) upon its termination or partial termination, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a plan to which section 412 does not apply, upon complete discontinuance of contributions under the plan,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the rights of all affected employees to benefits accrued to the date of such termination, partial termination, or discontinuance, to the extent funded as of such date, or the amounts credited to the employees&rsquo; accounts, are nonforfeitable. This paragraph shall not apply to benefits or contributions which, under provisions of the plan adopted pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary to preclude the discrimination prohibited by section 401(a)(4), may not be used for designated employees in the event of early termination of the plan. For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of the complete discontinuance of contributions under a profit-sharing or stock bonus plan, such plan shall be treated as having terminated on the day on which the plan administrator notifies the Secretary (in accordance with regulations) of the discontinuance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">[(4) Repealed. Pub. L. 99&ndash;514, title XI, &sect;1113(b), Oct. 22, 1986, 100 Stat. 2447]</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Treatment of voluntary employee contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a defined benefit plan which permits voluntary employee contributions, the portion of an employee's accrued benefit derived from such contributions shall be treated as an accrued benefit derived from employee contributions under a plan other than a defined benefit plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Accrued benefit not to be decreased by amendment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this section if the accrued benefit of a participant is decreased by an amendment of the plan, other than an amendment described in section 412(d)(2), or section 4281 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of certain plan amendments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) eliminating an optional form of benefit,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment shall be treated as reducing accrued benefits. In the case of a retirement-type subsidy, the preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to a participant who satisfies (either before or after the amendment) the preamendment conditions for the subsidy. The Secretary shall by regulations provide that this subparagraph shall not apply to any plan amendment which reduces or eliminates benefits or subsidies which create significant burdens or complexities for the plan and plan participants, unless such amendment adversely affects the rights of any participant in a more than de minimis manner. The Secretary may by regulations provide that this subparagraph shall not apply to a plan amendment described in clause (ii) (other than a plan amendment having an effect described in clause (i)).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Special rule for ESOPS</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, any&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) employee stock ownership plan (as defined in section 4975(e)(7)),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this paragraph merely because it modifies distribution options in a nondiscriminatory manner.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Plan transfers</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A defined contribution plan (in this subparagraph referred to as the &ldquo;transferee plan&rdquo;) shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subsection merely because the transferee plan does not provide some or all of the forms of distribution previously available under another defined contribution plan (in this subparagraph referred to as the &ldquo;transferor plan&rdquo;) to the extent that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the forms of distribution previously available under the transferor plan applied to the account of a participant or beneficiary under the transferor plan that was transferred from the transferor plan to the transferee plan pursuant to a direct transfer rather than pursuant to a distribution from the transferor plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the terms of both the transferor plan and the transferee plan authorize the transfer described in subclause (I),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the transfer described in subclause (I) was made pursuant to a voluntary <!-- PDFPage:1172 -->election by the participant or beneficiary whose account was transferred to the transferee plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) the election described in subclause (III) was made after the participant or beneficiary received a notice describing the consequences of making the election, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) the transferee plan allows the participant or beneficiary described in subclause (III) to receive any distribution to which the participant or beneficiary is entitled under the transferee plan in the form of a single sum distribution.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Special rule for mergers, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Clause (i) shall apply to plan mergers and other transactions having the effect of a direct transfer, including consolidations of benefits attributable to different employers within a multiple employer plan.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Elimination of form of distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except to the extent provided in regulations, a defined contribution plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this section merely because of the elimination of a form of distribution previously available thereunder. This subparagraph shall not apply to the elimination of a form of distribution with respect to any participant unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a single sum payment is available to such participant at the same time or times as the form of distribution being eliminated, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such single sum payment is based on the same or greater portion of the participant's account as the form of distribution being eliminated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Application of vesting standards to certain plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The provisions of this section (other than paragraph (2)) shall not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a governmental plan (within the meaning of section 414(d)),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a plan which has not, at any time after September 2, 1974, provided for employer contributions, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a plan established and maintained by a society, order, or association described in section 501(c)(8) or (9), if no part of the contributions to or under such plan are made by employers of participants in such plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A plan described in paragraph (1) shall be treated as meeting the requirements of this section, for purposes of section 401(a), if such plan meets the vesting requirements resulting from the application of sections 401(a)(4) and 401(a)(7) as in effect on September 1, 1974.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirement to meet minimum funding standard</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A plan to which this section applies shall satisfy the minimum funding standard applicable to the plan for any plan year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Minimum funding standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a plan shall be treated as satisfying the minimum funding standard for a plan year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a defined benefit plan which is not a multiemployer plan, the employer makes contributions to or under the plan for the plan year which, in the aggregate, are not less than the minimum required contribution determined under section 430 for the plan for the plan year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a money purchase plan which is not a multiemployer plan, the employer makes contributions to or under the plan for the plan year which are required under the terms of the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of a multiemployer plan, the employers make contributions to or under the plan for any plan year which, in the aggregate, are sufficient to ensure that the plan does not have an accumulated funding deficiency under section 431 as of the end of the plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Liability for contributions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the amount of any contribution required by this section (including any required installments under paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 430(j)) shall be paid by the employer responsible for making contributions to or under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Joint and several liability where employer member of controlled group</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Multiemployer plans in critical status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply in the case of a multiemployer plan for any plan year in which the plan is in critical status pursuant to section 432. This paragraph shall only apply if the plan sponsor adopts a rehabilitation plan in accordance with section 432(e) and complies with such rehabilitation plan (and any modifications of the plan).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Variance from minimum funding standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Waiver in case of business hardship</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an employer is (or in the case of a multiemployer plan, 10 percent or more of the number of employers contributing to or under the plan are) unable to satisfy the minimum funding standard for a plan year without temporary substantial business hardship (substantial business hardship in the case of a multiemployer plan), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) application of the standard would be adverse to the interests of plan participants in the aggregate,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the Secretary may, subject to subparagraph (C), waive the requirements of subsection (a) for such year with respect to all or any portion of the minimum funding standard. The Secretary shall not waive the minimum funding standard with respect to a plan for more than 3 of any 15 (5 of any 15 in the case of a multiemployer plan) consecutive plan years&nbsp;<sup><a href="#412_1_target" name="412_1">1</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Effects of waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a waiver is granted under subparagraph (A) for any plan year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of a defined benefit plan which is not a multiemployer plan, the minimum required contribution under section 430 for the plan year shall be reduced by the amount of the waived funding deficiency and such amount shall be amortized as required under section 430(e), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a multiemployer plan, the funding standard account shall be credited under section 431(b)(3)(C) with the amount of the waived funding deficiency and such amount shall be amortized as required under section 431(b)(2)(C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Waiver of amortized portion not allowed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may not waive under subparagraph (A) any portion of the minimum funding standard under subsection (a) for a plan year which is attributable to any waived funding deficiency for any preceding plan year.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1181 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of business hardship</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the employer is operating at an economic loss,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there is substantial unemployment or underemployment in the trade or business and in the industry concerned,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the sales and profits of the industry concerned are depressed or declining, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) it is reasonable to expect that the plan will be continued only if the waiver is granted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Waived funding deficiency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section and part III of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;waived funding deficiency&rdquo; means the portion of the minimum funding standard under subsection (a) (determined without regard to the waiver) for a plan year waived by the Secretary and not satisfied by employer contributions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The amount described in clause (i)(I) shall include any increase in such amount which would result if all applications for waivers of the minimum funding standard under this subsection which are pending with respect to such plan were denied.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Special rules for single-employer plans</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Application must be submitted before date 21/2 months after close of year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a defined benefit plan which is not a multiemployer plan, no waiver may be granted under this subsection with respect to any plan for any plan year unless an application therefor is submitted to the Secretary not later than the 15th day of the 3rd month beginning after the close of such plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule if employer is member of controlled group</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a defined benefit plan which is not a multiemployer plan, if an employer is a member of a controlled group, the temporary substantial business hardship requirements of paragraph (1) shall be treated as met only if such requirements are met&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) with respect to the controlled group of which such employer is a member (determined by treating all members of such group as a single employer).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The Secretary may provide that an analysis of a trade or business or industry of a member need not be conducted if the Secretary determines such analysis is not necessary because the taking into account of such member would not significantly affect the determination under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Advance notice</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall, before granting a waiver under this subsection, require each <!-- PDFPage:1182 -->applicant to provide evidence satisfactory to the Secretary that the applicant has provided notice of the filing of the application for such waiver to each affected party (as defined in section 4001(a)(21) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974).

<p class="statutory-body-2em">No amendment of a plan which increases the liabilities of the plan by reason of any increase in benefits, any change in the accrual of benefits, or any change in the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable under the plan shall be adopted if a waiver under this subsection or an extension of time under section 431(d) is in effect with respect to the plan, or if a plan amendment described in subsection (d)(2) which reduces the accrued benefit of any participant has been made at any time in the preceding 12 months (24 months in the case of a multiemployer plan). If a plan is amended in violation of the preceding sentence, any such waiver, or extension of time, shall not apply to any plan year ending on or after the date on which such amendment is adopted.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an employee annuity plan described in section 403(a),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an annuity contract described in section 403(b), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a simplified employee pension described in section 408(k),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">such a contract, plan, or pension shall not be considered to be described in section 403(a), 403(b), or 408(k), as the case may be, unless it satisfies the requirements of subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1), whichever is appropriate, and has not been disqualified under subsection (g). In the case of an annuity contract described in section 403(b), the preceding sentence shall apply only to the portion of the annuity contract which exceeds the limitation of subsection (b) or the limitation of subsection (c), whichever is appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation for defined benefit plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Benefits with respect to a participant exceed the limitation of this subsection if, when expressed as an annual benefit (within the meaning of paragraph (2)), such annual benefit is greater than the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) $160,000, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 100 percent of the participant's average compensation for his high 3 years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual benefit</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;annual benefit&rdquo; means a benefit payable <!-- PDFPage:1217 -->annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) under a plan to which employees do not contribute and under which no rollover contributions (as defined in sections 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3), and 457(e)(16)) are made.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjustment for certain other forms of benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the benefit under the plan is payable in any form other than the form described in subparagraph (A), or if the employees contribute to the plan or make rollover contributions (as defined in sections 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3), and 457(e)(16)), the determinations as to whether the limitation described in paragraph (1) has been satisfied shall be made, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary by adjusting such benefit so that it is equivalent to the benefit described in subparagraph (A). For purposes of this subparagraph, any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits shall not be taken into account; and that portion of any joint and survivor annuity which constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity (as defined in section 417) shall not be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Adjustment to $160,000 limit where benefit begins before age 62</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the retirement income benefit under the plan begins before age 62, the determination as to whether the $160,000 limitation set forth in paragraph (1)(A) has been satisfied shall be made, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by reducing the limitation of paragraph (1)(A) so that such limitation (as so reduced) equals an annual benefit (beginning when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000 annual benefit beginning at age 62.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Adjustment to $160,000 limit where benefit begins after age 65</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the retirement income benefit under the plan begins after age 65, the determination as to whether the $160,000 limitation set forth in paragraph (1)(A) has been satisfied shall be made, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by increasing the limitation of paragraph (1)(A) so that such limitation (as so increased) equals an annual benefit (beginning when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000 annual benefit beginning at age 65.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Limitation on certain assumptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For purposes of adjusting any limitation under subparagraph (C) and, except as provided in clause (ii), for purposes of adjusting any benefit under subparagraph (B), the interest rate assumption shall not be less than the greater of 5 percent or the rate specified in the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For purposes of adjusting any benefit under subparagraph (B) for any form of benefit subject to section 417(e)(3), the interest rate assumption shall not be less than the greatest of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) 5.5 percent,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the rate that provides a benefit of not more than 105 percent of the benefit that would be provided if the applicable interest rate (as defined in section 417(e)(3)) were the interest rate assumption, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) the rate specified under the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) For purposes of adjusting any limitation under subparagraph (D), the interest rate assumption shall not be greater than the lesser of 5 percent or the rate specified in the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) For purposes of this subsection, no adjustments under subsection (d)(1) shall be taken into account before the year for which such adjustment first takes effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) For purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation under subparagraph (B), (C), or (D), the mortality table used shall be the applicable mortality table (within the meaning of section 417(e)(3)(B)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) In the case of a plan maintained by an eligible employer (as defined in section 408(p)(2)(C)(i)), clause (ii) shall be applied without regard to subclause (II) thereof.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Total annual benefits not in excess of $10,000</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) it is established to the satisfaction of a plan representative that the consent required under subparagraph (A) may not be obtained because there is no spouse, because the spouse cannot be located, or because of such other circumstances as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), a plan fully subsidizes the costs of a benefit if under the plan the failure to waive such benefit by a participant would not result in a decrease in any plan benefits with respect to such participant and would not result in increased contributions from such participant.</p>
