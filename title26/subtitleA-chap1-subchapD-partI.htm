<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirements for qualification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A trust created or organized in the United States and forming part of a stock bonus, pension, or profit-sharing plan of an employer for the exclusive benefit of his employees or their beneficiaries shall constitute a qualified trust under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if contributions are made to the trust by such employer, or employees, or both, or by another employer who is entitled to deduct his contributions under section 404(a)(3)(B) (relating to deduction for contributions to profit-sharing and stock bonus plans), or by a charitable remainder trust pursuant to a qualified gratuitous transfer (as defined in section 664(g)(1)), for the purpose of distributing to such employees or their beneficiaries the corpus and income of the fund accumulated by the trust in accordance with such plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if under the trust instrument it is impossible, at any time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to employees and their beneficiaries under the trust, for any part of the corpus or income to be (within the taxable year or thereafter) used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of his employees or their beneficiaries (but this paragraph shall not be construed, in the case of a multiemployer plan, to prohibit the return of a contribution within 6 months after the plan administrator determines that the contribution was made by a mistake of fact or law (other than a mistake relating to whether the plan is described in section 401(a) or the trust which is part of such plan is exempt from taxation under section 501(a), or the return of any withdrawal liability payment determined to be an overpayment within 6 months of such determination).;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#401_1_target" name="401_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if the plan of which such trust is a part satisfies the requirements of section 410 (relating to minimum participation standards); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) if the contributions or benefits provided under the plan do not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)). For purposes of this paragraph, there shall be excluded from consideration employees described in section 410(b)(3)(A) and (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Special rules relating to nondiscrimination requirements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Salaried or clerical employees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A classification shall not be considered dis<!-- PDFPage:1016 -->criminatory within the meaning of paragraph (4) or section 410(b)(2)(A)(i) merely because it is limited to salaried or clerical employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Contributions and benefits may bear uniform relationship to compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A plan shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of paragraph (4) merely because the contributions or benefits of, or on behalf of, the employees under the plan bear a uniform relationship to the compensation (within the meaning of section 414(s)) of such employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Certain disparity permitted</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A plan shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of paragraph (4) merely because the contributions or benefits of, or on behalf of, the employees under the plan favor highly compensated employees (as defined in section 414(q)) in the manner permitted under subsection (l).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Integrated defined benefit plan.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A defined benefit plan shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of paragraph (4) merely because the plan provides that the employer-derived accrued retirement benefit for any participant under the plan may not exceed the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the participant's final pay with the employer, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the employer-derived retirement benefit created under Federal law attributable to service by the participant with the employer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;For purposes of this clause, the employer-derived retirement benefit created under Federal law shall be treated as accruing ratably over 35 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Final pay</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this subparagraph, the participant's final pay is the compensation (as defined in section 414(q)(4)) paid to the participant by the employer for any year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) which ends during the 5-year period ending with the year in which the participant separated from service for the employer, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) for which the participant's total compensation from the employer was highest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) 2 <cap-smallcap>or more plans treated as single plan</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of determining whether 2 or more plans of an employer satisfy the requirements of paragraph (4) when considered as a single plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>Contributions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the amount of contributions on behalf of the employees allowed as a deduction under section 404 for the taxable year with respect to such plans, taken together, bears a uniform relationship to the compensation (within the meaning of section 414(s)) of such employees, the plans shall not be considered discriminatory merely because the rights of employees to, or derived from, the employer contributions under the separate plans do not become nonforfeitable at the same rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Benefits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the employees&rsquo; rights to benefits under the separate plans do not become nonforfeitable at the same rate, but the levels of benefits provided by the separate plans satisfy the requirements of regulations prescribed by the Secretary to take account of the differences in such rates, the plans shall not be considered discriminatory merely because of the difference in such rates.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) <cap-smallcap>Social security retirement age</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of testing for discrimination under paragraph (4)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the social security retirement age (as defined in section 415(b)(8)) shall be treated as a uniform retirement age, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) subsidized early retirement benefits and joint and survivor annuities shall not be treated as being unavailable to employees on the same terms merely because such benefits or annuities are based in whole or in part on an employee's social security retirement age (as so defined).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) <cap-smallcap>Governmental plans</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Paragraphs (3) and (4) shall not apply to a governmental plan (within the meaning of section 414(d)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A plan shall be considered as meeting the requirements of paragraph (3) during the whole of any taxable year of the plan if on one day in each quarter it satisfied such requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan of which such trust is a part satisfies the requirements of section 411 (relating to minimum vesting standards).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) A trust forming part of a defined benefit plan shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan provides that forfeitures must not be applied to increase the benefits any employee would otherwise receive under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) <cap-smallcap>Required distributions.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this subsection unless the plan provides that the entire interest of each employee&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) will be distributed to such employee not later than the required beginning date, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) will be distributed, beginning not later than the required beginning date, in accordance with regulations, over the life of such employee or over the lives of such employee and a designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such employee or the life expectancy of such employee and a designated beneficiary).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Required distribution where employee dies before entire interest is distributed.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>Where distributions have begun under subparagraph</cap-smallcap> (A)(ii).&mdash;A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan provides that if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the distribution of the employee's interest has begun in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the employee dies before his entire interest has been distributed to him,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1017 --><p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;the remaining portion of such interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distributions being used under subparagraph (A)(ii) as of the date of his death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 5-<cap-smallcap>year rule for other cases</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan provides that, if an employee dies before the distribution of the employee's interest has begun in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii), the entire interest of the employee will be distributed within 5 years after the death of such employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Exception to 5-year rule for certain amounts payable over life of beneficiary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) any portion of the employee's interest is payable to (or for the benefit of) a designated beneficiary,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) such portion will be distributed (in accordance with regulations) over the life of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such beneficiary), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) such distributions begin not later than 1 year after the date of the employee's death or such later date as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the date on which the distributions are required to begin under clause (iii)(III) shall not be earlier than the date on which the employee would have attained age 701/2, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) if the surviving spouse dies before the distributions to such spouse begin, this subparagraph shall be applied as if the surviving spouse were the employee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Required beginning date</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) <cap-smallcap>Treatment of payments to children</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, for purposes of this paragraph, any amount paid to a child shall be treated as if it had been paid to the surviving spouse if such amount will become payable to the surviving spouse upon such child reaching majority (or other designated event permitted under regulations).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) <cap-smallcap>Treatment of incidental death benefit distributions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this title, any distribution required under the incidental death benefit requirements of this subsection shall be treated as a distribution required under this paragraph.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Contributions to an employees&rsquo; trust made by an employer during a taxable year of the employer which ends with or within a taxable year of the trust for which the trust is not exempt from tax under section 501(a) shall be included in the gross income of the employee in accordance with section 83 (relating to property transferred in connection with performance of services), except that the value of the employee's interest in the trust shall be substituted for the fair market value of the property for purposes of applying such section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Failure to meet requirements of section 410(b)</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Highly compensated employees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If 1 of the reasons a trust is not exempt from tax under section 501(a) is the failure of the plan of which it is a part to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(26) or 410(b), then a highly compensated employee shall, in lieu of the amount determined under paragraph (1) or (2) include in gross income for the taxable year with or within which the taxable year of the trust ends an amount equal to the vested accrued benefit of such employee (other than the employee's investment in the contract) as of the close of such taxable year of the trust.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Failure to meet coverage tests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a trust is not exempt from tax under section 501(a) for any taxable year solely be<!-- PDFPage:1060 -->cause such trust is part of a plan which fails to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(26) or 410(b), paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply by reason of such failure to any employee who was not a highly compensated employee during&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such portion is transferred in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to a qualified trust or to an annuity contract described in section 403(b) and such trust or contract provides for separate accounting for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible, or</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If contributions are paid by an employer to or under a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plan, or if compensation is paid or accrued on account of any employee under a plan deferring the receipt of such compensation, such contributions or compensation shall not be deductible under this chapter; but, if they would otherwise be deductible, they shall be deductible under this section, subject, however, to the fol<!-- PDFPage:1090 -->lowing limitations as to the amounts deductible in any year:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Pension trusts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the taxable year when paid, if the contributions are paid into a pension trust (other than a trust to which paragraph (3) applies), and if such taxable year ends within or with a taxable year of the trust for which the trust is exempt under section 501(a), in the case of a defined benefit plan other than a multiemployer plan, in an amount determined under subsection (<em>o</em>), and in the case of any other plan in an amount determined as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount necessary to satisfy the minimum funding standard provided by section 412(a) for plan years ending within or with such taxable year (or for any prior plan year), if such amount is greater than the amount determined under clause (ii) or (iii) (whichever is applicable with respect to the plan),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount necessary to provide with respect to all of the employees under the trust the remaining unfunded cost of their past and current service credits distributed as a level amount, or a level percentage of compensation, over the remaining future service of each such employee, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, but if such remaining unfunded cost with respect to any 3 individuals is more than 50 percent of such remaining unfunded cost, the amount of such unfunded cost attributable to such individuals shall be distributed over a period of at least 5 taxable years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) an amount equal to the normal cost of the plan, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, plus, if past service or other supplementary pension or annuity credits are provided by the plan, an amount necessary to amortize the unfunded costs attributable to such credits in equal annual payments (until fully amortized) over 10 years, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In determining the amount deductible in such year under the foregoing limitations the funding method and the actuarial assumptions used shall be those used for such year under section 431, and the maximum amount deductible for such year shall be an amount equal to the full funding limitation for such year determined under section 431.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule in case of certain amendments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a multiemployer plan which the Secretary of Labor finds to be collectively bargained which makes an election under this subparagraph (in such manner and at such time as may be provided under regulations prescribed by the Secretary), if the full funding limitation determined under section 431(c)(6) for such year is zero, if as a result of any plan amendment applying to such plan year, the amount determined under section 431(c)(6)(A)(ii) exceeds the amount determined under section 431(c)(6)(A)(i), and if the funding method and the actuarial assumptions used are those used for such year under section 431, the maximum amount deductible in such year under the limitations of this paragraph shall be an amount equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the full funding limitation for such year determined by applying section 431(c)(6) but increasing the amount referred to in subparagraph (A) thereof by the decrease in the present value of all unamortized liabilities resulting from such amendment, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the normal cost under the plan reduced by the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments over 10 years (until fully amortized) the decrease described in clause (i).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In the case of any election under this subparagraph, the amount deductible under the limitations of this paragraph with respect to any of the plan years following the plan year for which such election was made shall be determined as provided under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary to carry out the purposes of this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Certain collectively-bargained plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a plan which the Secretary of Labor finds to be collectively bargained, established or maintained by an employer doing business in not less than 40 States and engaged in the trade or business of furnishing or selling services described in section 168(i)(10)(C), with respect to which the rates have been established or approved by a State or political subdivision thereof, by any agency or instrumentality of the United States, or by a public service or public utility commission or other similar body of any State or political subdivision thereof, and in the case of any employer which is a member of a controlled group with such employer, subparagraph (B) shall be applied by substituting for the words &ldquo;plan amendment&rdquo; the words &ldquo;plan amendment or increase in benefits payable under title II of the Social Security Act&rdquo;. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;controlled group&rdquo; has the meaning provided by section 1563(a), determined without regard to section 1563(a)(4) and (e)(3)(C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Amount determined on basis of unfunded current liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a defined benefit plan which is a multiemployer plan, except as provided in regulations, the maximum amount deductible under the limitations of this paragraph shall not be less than the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 140 percent of the current liability of the plan determined under section 431(c)(6)(D), over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the value of the plan's assets determined under section 431(c)(2).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Carryover</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount paid in a taxable year in excess of the amount deductible in such year <!-- PDFPage:1091 -->under the foregoing limitations shall be deductible in the succeeding taxable years in order of time to the extent of the difference between the amount paid and deductible in each such succeeding year and the maximum amount deductible for such year under the foregoing limitations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Employees&rsquo; annuities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the taxable year when paid, in an amount determined in accordance with paragraph (1), if the contributions are paid toward the purchase of retirement annuities, or retirement annuities and medical benefits as described in section 401(h), and such purchase is part of a plan which meets the requirements of section 401(a)(3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), (16), (17),<sup><a href="#404_1_target" name="404_1">1</a></sup> (19), (20), (22), (26), (27), (31), and (37) and, if applicable, the requirements of section 401(a)(10) and of section 401(d), and if refunds of premiums, if any, are applied within the current taxable year or next succeeding taxable year toward the purchase of such retirement annuities, or such retirement annuities and medical benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Stock bonus and profit-sharing trusts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Limits on deductible contributions</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the taxable year when paid, if the contributions are paid into a stock bonus or profit-sharing trust, and if such taxable year ends within or with a taxable year of the trust with respect to which the trust is exempt under section 501(a), in an amount not in excess of the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) 25 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during the taxable year to the beneficiaries under the stock bonus or profit-sharing plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the amount such employer is required to contribute to such trust under section 401(k)(11) for such year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Carryover of excess contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any amount paid into the trust in any taxable year in excess of the limitation of clause (i) (or the corresponding provision of prior law) shall be deductible in the succeeding taxable years in order of time, but the amount so deductible under this clause in any 1 such succeeding taxable year together with the amount allowable under clause (i) shall not exceed the amount described in subclause (I) or (II) of clause (i), whichever is greater, with respect to such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Certain retirement plans excluded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;stock bonus or profit-sharing trust&rdquo; shall not include any trust designed to provide benefits upon retirement and covering a period of years, if under the plan the amounts to be contributed by the employer can be determined actuarially as provided in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) 2 or more trusts treated as 1 trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the contributions are made to 2 or more stock bonus or profit-sharing trusts, such trusts shall be considered a single trust for purposes of applying the limitations in this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(v) Defined contribution plans subject to the funding standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided by the Secretary, a defined contribution plan which is subject to the funding standards of section 412 shall be treated in the same manner as a stock bonus or profit-sharing plan for purposes of this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Profit-sharing plan of affiliated group</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a profit-sharing plan, or a stock bonus plan in which contributions are determined with reference to profits, of a group of corporations which is an affiliated group within the meaning of section 1504, if any member of such affiliated group is prevented from making a contribution which it would otherwise have made under the plan, by reason of having no current or accumulated earnings or profits or because such earnings or profits are less than the contributions which it would otherwise have made, then so much of the contribution which such member was so prevented from making may be made, for the benefit of the employees of such member, by the other members of the group, to the extent of current or accumulated earnings or profits, except that such contribution by each such other member shall be limited, where the group does not file a consolidated return, to that proportion of its total current and accumulated earnings or profits remaining after adjustment for its contribution deductible without regard to this subparagraph which the total prevented contribution bears to the total current and accumulated earnings or profits of all the members of the group remaining after adjustment for all contributions deductible without regard to this subparagraph. Contributions made under the preceding sentence shall be deductible under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph by the employer making such contribution, and, for the purpose of determining amounts which may be carried forward and deducted under the second sentence of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph in succeeding taxable years, shall be deemed to have been made by the employer on behalf of whose employees such contributions were made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Trusts created or organized outside the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a stock bonus, pension, or profit-sharing trust would qualify for exemption under section 501(a) except for the fact that it is a trust created or organized outside the United States, contributions to such a trust by an employer which is a resident, or corporation, or other entity of the United States, shall be deductible under the preceding paragraphs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Other plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the plan is not one included in paragraph (1), (2), or (3), in the taxable year in which an amount attributable to the contribution is in<!-- PDFPage:1092 -->cludible in the gross income of employees participating in the plan, but, in the case of a plan in which more than one employee participates only if separate accounts are maintained for each employee. For purposes of this section, any vacation pay which is treated as deferred compensation shall be deductible for the taxable year of the employer in which paid to the employee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Time when contributions deemed made</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), a taxpayer shall be deemed to have made a payment on the last day of the preceding taxable year if the payment is on account of such taxable year and is made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return for such taxable year (including extensions thereof).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Limitation on deductions where combination of defined contribution plan and defined benefit plan</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If amounts are deductible under the foregoing paragraphs of this subsection (other than paragraph (5)) in connection with 1 or more defined contribution plans and 1 or more defined benefit plans or in connection with trusts or plans described in 2 or more of such paragraphs, the total amount deductible in a taxable year under such plans shall not exceed the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 25 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during the taxable year to the beneficiaries under such plans, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of contributions made to or under the defined benefit plans to the extent such contributions do not exceed the amount of employer contributions necessary to satisfy the minimum funding standard provided by section 412 with respect to any such defined benefit plans for the plan year which ends with or within such taxable year (or for any prior plan year).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">A defined contribution plan which is a pension plan shall not be treated as failing to provide definitely determinable benefits merely by limiting employer contributions to amounts deductible under this section. In the case of a defined benefit plan which is a single employer plan, the amount necessary to satisfy the minimum funding standard provided by section 412 shall not be less than the excess (if any) of the plan's funding target (as defined in section 430(d)(1)) over the value of the plan's assets (as determined under section 430(g)(3)).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Carryover of contributions in excess of the deductible limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount paid under the plans in any taxable year in excess of the limitation of subparagraph (A) shall be deductible in the succeeding taxable years in order of time, but the amount so deductible under this subparagraph in any 1 such succeeding taxable year together with the amount allowable under subparagraph (A) shall not exceed 25 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during such taxable year to the beneficiaries under the plans.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Paragraph not to apply in certain cases</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Beneficiary test</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">This paragraph shall not have the effect of reducing the amount otherwise deductible under paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), if no employee is a beneficiary under more than 1 trust or under a trust and an annuity plan.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Elective deferrals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If, in connection with 1 or more defined contribution plans and 1 or more defined benefit plans, no amounts (other than elective deferrals (as defined in section 402(g)(3))) are contributed to any of the defined contribution plans for the taxable year, then subparagraph (A) shall not apply with respect to any of such defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of employer contributions to 1 or more defined contribution plans&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) if such contributions do not exceed 6 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during the taxable year to the beneficiaries under such plans, this paragraph shall not apply to such contributions or to employer contributions to the defined benefit plans to which this paragraph would otherwise apply by reason of contributions to the defined contribution plans, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) if such contributions exceed 6 percent of such compensation, this paragraph shall be applied by only taking into account such contributions to the extent of such excess.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;For purposes of this clause, amounts carried over from preceding taxable years under subparagraph (B) shall be treated as employer contributions to 1 or more defined contributions plans to the extent attributable to employer contributions to such plans in such preceding taxable years.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Guaranteed plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In applying this paragraph, any single-employer plan covered under section 4021 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 shall not be taken into account.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Self-employed individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a plan included in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) which provides contributions or benefits for employees some or all of whom are employees within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), for purposes of this section&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any reference to compensation shall, in the case of an individual who is an employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), be considered to be a reference to the earned income of such individual derived from the trade or business with respect to which the plan is established.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Separate accounting required in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of the defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for the portion of each employee's accrued benefit derived from any voluntary employee contributions permitted under the plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of any plan which is not a defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for each employee's accrued benefit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Year of participation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of determining an employee's accrued benefit, the term &ldquo;year of participation&rdquo; means a period of service (beginning at the earliest date on which the employee is a participant in the plan and which is included in a period of service required to be taken into account under section 410(a)(5), determined without regard to section 410(a)(5)(E)) as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor which provide for the calculation of such period on any reasonable and consistent basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Less than full time service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, except as provided in subparagraph (C), in the case of any employee whose customary employment is less than full time, the calculation of such employee's service on any basis which provides less than a ratable portion of the accrued benefit to which he would be entitled under the plan if his customary employment were full time shall not be treated as made on a reasonable and consistent basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Less than 1,000 hours of service during year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of any employee whose service is less than 1,000 hours during any calendar year, plan year or other 12-consecutive month period designated by the plan (and not prohibited under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor) the calculation of his period of service shall not be treated as not made on a reasonable and consistent basis solely because such service is not taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Seasonal industries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any seasonal industry where the customary period of employment is less than 1,000 hours during a calendar year, the term &ldquo;year of participation&rdquo; shall be such period as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Maritime industries</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Similarly situated</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, a participant is similarly situated to any other individual if such participant is identical to such other individual in every respect (including period of service, compensation, position, date of hire, work history, and any other respect) except for age.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">In determining the accrued benefit as of any date for purposes of this subparagraph, the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy shall be disregarded.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Accrued benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the accrued benefit may, under the terms of the plan, be expressed as an annuity payable at normal retirement age, the balance of a hypothetical account, or the current value of the accumulated percentage of the employee's final average compensation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Applicable defined benefit plans</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Interest credits</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">An applicable defined benefit plan shall be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) unless the terms of the plan provide that any interest credit (or an equivalent amount) for any plan year shall be at a rate which is not greater than a market rate of return. A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subclause merely because the plan provides for a reasonable minimum guaranteed rate of return or for a rate of return that is equal to the greater of a fixed or variable rate of return.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1169 --><h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Preservation of capital</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">An applicable defined benefit plan shall be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) unless the plan provides that an interest credit (or equivalent amount) of less than zero shall in no event result in the account balance or similar amount being less than the aggregate amount of contributions credited to the account.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(III) Market rate of return</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The Secretary may provide by regulation for rules governing the calculation of a market rate of return for purposes of subclause (I) and for permissible methods of crediting interest to the account (including fixed or variable interest rates) resulting in effective rates of return meeting the requirements of subclause (I).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">If, after June 29, 2005, an applicable plan amendment is adopted, the plan shall be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) unless the requirements of clause (iii) are met with respect to each individual who was a participant in the plan immediately before the adoption of the amendment.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Rate of benefit accrual</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subject to clause (iv), the requirements of this clause are met with respect to any participant if the accrued benefit of the participant under the terms of the plan as in effect after the amendment is not less than the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the participant's accrued benefit for years of service before the effective date of the amendment, determined under the terms of the plan as in effect before the amendment, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the participant's accrued benefit for years of service after the effective date of the amendment, determined under the terms of the plan as in effect after the amendment.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Special rules for early retirement subsidies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (iii)(I), the plan shall credit the accumulation account or similar amount&nbsp;<sup><a href="#411_2_target" name="411_2">2</a></sup> with the amount of any early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy for the plan year in which the participant retires if, as of such time, the participant has met the age, years of service, and other requirements under the plan for entitlement to such benefit or subsidy.</p>

<h4 class="subclause-head">(III) Multiple amendments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The Secretary shall issue regulations to prevent the avoidance of the purposes of this subparagraph through the use of 2 or more plan amendments rather than a single amendment.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(IV) Applicable defined benefit plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;applicable defined benefit plan&rdquo; has the meaning given such term by section 411(a)(13).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vi) Termination requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">An applicable defined benefit plan shall not be treated as meeting the requirements of clause (i) unless the plan provides that, upon the termination of the plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) if the interest credit rate (or an equivalent amount) under the plan is a variable rate, the rate of interest used to determine accrued benefits under the plan shall be equal to the average of the rates of interest used under the plan during the 5-year period ending on the termination date, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the interest rate and mortality table used to determine the amount of any benefit under the plan payable in the form of an annuity payable at normal retirement age shall be the rate and table specified under the plan for such purpose as of the termination date, except that if such interest rate is a variable rate, the interest rate shall be determined under the rules of subclause (I).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Certain offsets permitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H)(i) solely because the plan provides offsets against benefits under the plan to the extent such offsets are otherwise allowable in applying the requirements of section 401(a).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Permitted disparities in plan contributions or benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) solely because the plan provides a disparity in contributions or benefits with respect to which the requirements of section 401(<em>l</em>) are met.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Indexing permitted</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) solely because the plan provides for indexing of accrued benefits under the plan.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1170 --><h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Protection against loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except in the case of any benefit provided in the form of a variable annuity, clause (i) shall not apply with respect to any indexing which results in an accrued benefit less than the accrued benefit determined without regard to such indexing.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Indexing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;indexing&rdquo; means, in connection with an accrued benefit, the periodic adjustment of the accrued benefit by means of the application of a recognized investment index or methodology.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Accrued benefit derived from employer contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, an employee's accrued benefit derived from employer contributions as of any applicable date is the excess, if any, of the accrued benefit for such employee as of such applicable date over the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by such employee as of such date.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Accrued benefit derived from employee contributions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Plans other than defined benefit plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a plan other than a defined benefit plan, the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee as of any applicable date is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) except as provided in clause (ii), the balance of the employee's separate account consisting only of his contributions and the income, expenses, gains, and losses attributable thereto, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if a separate account is not maintained with respect to an employee's contributions under such a plan, the amount which bears the same ratio to his total accrued benefit as the total amount of the employee's contributions (less withdrawals) bears to the sum of such contributions and the contributions made on his behalf by the employer (less withdrawals).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Defined benefit plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a defined benefit plan, the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee as of any applicable date is the amount equal to the employee's accumulated contributions expressed as an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, using an interest rate which would be used under the plan under section 417(e)(3) (as of the determination date).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Definition of accumulated contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;accumulated contribution&rdquo; means the total of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there have been, or there is reason to believe there will be, an accrual of benefits or forfeitures tending to discriminate in favor of employees who are highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a plan to which section 412 does not apply, upon complete discontinuance of contributions under the plan,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the rights of all affected employees to benefits accrued to the date of such termination, partial termination, or discontinuance, to the extent funded as of such date, or the amounts credited to the employees&rsquo; accounts, are nonforfeitable. This paragraph shall not apply to benefits or contributions which, under provisions of the plan adopted pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary to preclude the discrimination prohibited by section 401(a)(4), may not be used for designated employees in the event of early termination of the plan. For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of the complete discontinuance of contributions under a profit-sharing or stock bonus plan, such plan shall be treated as having terminated on the day on which the plan administrator notifies the Secretary (in accordance with regulations) of the discontinuance.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this section if the accrued benefit of a participant is decreased by an amendment of the plan, other than an amendment described in section 412(d)(2), or section 4281 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.</p>

In the case of a retirement-type subsidy, the preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to a participant who satisfies (either before or after the amendment) the preamendment conditions for the subsidy. The Secretary shall by regulations provide that this subparagraph shall not apply to any plan amendment which reduces or eliminates benefits or subsidies which create significant burdens or complexities for the plan and plan participants, unless such amendment adversely affects the rights of any participant in a more than de minimis manner. The Secretary may by regulations provide that this subparagraph shall not apply to a plan amendment described in clause (ii) (other than a plan amendment having an effect described in clause (i)).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A trust which is a part of a pension, profitsharing, or stock bonus plan shall not constitute a qualified trust under section 401(a) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a defined benefit plan, the plan provides for the payment of benefits with respect to a participant which exceed the limitation of subsection (b), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a defined contribution plan, contributions and other additions under the plan with respect to any participant for any taxable year exceed the limitation of subsection (c).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Section applies to certain annuities and accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an employee annuity plan described in section 403(a),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an annuity contract described in section 403(b), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a simplified employee pension described in section 408(k),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">such a contract, plan, or pension shall not be considered to be described in section 403(a), 403(b), or 408(k), as the case may be, unless it satisfies the requirements of subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1), whichever is appropriate, and has not been disqualified under subsection (g). In the case of an annuity contract described in section 403(b), the preceding sentence shall apply only to the portion of the annuity contract which exceeds the limitation of subsection (b) or the limitation of subsection (c), whichever is appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation for defined benefit plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Benefits with respect to a participant exceed the limitation of this subsection if, when expressed as an annual benefit (within the meaning of paragraph (2)), such annual benefit is greater than the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) $160,000, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 100 percent of the participant's average compensation for his high 3 years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual benefit</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;annual benefit&rdquo; means a benefit payable <!-- PDFPage:1217 -->annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) under a plan to which employees do not contribute and under which no rollover contributions (as defined in sections 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3), and 457(e)(16)) are made.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjustment for certain other forms of benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the benefit under the plan is payable in any form other than the form described in subparagraph (A), or if the employees contribute to the plan or make rollover contributions (as defined in sections 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3), and 457(e)(16)), the determinations as to whether the limitation described in paragraph (1) has been satisfied shall be made, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary by adjusting such benefit so that it is equivalent to the benefit described in subparagraph (A). For purposes of this subparagraph, any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits shall not be taken into account; and that portion of any joint and survivor annuity which constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity (as defined in section 417) shall not be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Adjustment to $160,000 limit where benefit begins before age 62</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the retirement income benefit under the plan begins before age 62, the determination as to whether the $160,000 limitation set forth in paragraph (1)(A) has been satisfied shall be made, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by reducing the limitation of paragraph (1)(A) so that such limitation (as so reduced) equals an annual benefit (beginning when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000 annual benefit beginning at age 62.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Adjustment to $160,000 limit where benefit begins after age 65</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the retirement income benefit under the plan begins after age 65, the determination as to whether the $160,000 limitation set forth in paragraph (1)(A) has been satisfied shall be made, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by increasing the limitation of paragraph (1)(A) so that such limitation (as so increased) equals an annual benefit (beginning when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000 annual benefit beginning at age 65.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Limitation on certain assumptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For purposes of adjusting any limitation under subparagraph (C) and, except as provided in clause (ii), for purposes of adjusting any benefit under subparagraph (B), the interest rate assumption shall not be less than the greater of 5 percent or the rate specified in the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For purposes of adjusting any benefit under subparagraph (B) for any form of benefit subject to section 417(e)(3), the interest rate assumption shall not be less than the greatest of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) 5.5 percent,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the rate that provides a benefit of not more than 105 percent of the benefit that would be provided if the applicable interest rate (as defined in section 417(e)(3)) were the interest rate assumption, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) the rate specified under the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) For purposes of adjusting any limitation under subparagraph (D), the interest rate assumption shall not be greater than the lesser of 5 percent or the rate specified in the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) For purposes of this subsection, no adjustments under subsection (d)(1) shall be taken into account before the year for which such adjustment first takes effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) For purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation under subparagraph (B), (C), or (D), the mortality table used shall be the applicable mortality table (within the meaning of section 417(e)(3)(B)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) In the case of a plan maintained by an eligible employer (as defined in section 408(p)(2)(C)(i)), clause (ii) shall be applied without regard to subclause (II) thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">[(F) Repealed. Pub. L. 107&ndash;16, title VI, &sect;611(a)(5)(A), June 7, 2001, 115 Stat. 97]</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(I) Exemption for survivor and disability benefits provided under governmental plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (C) of this paragraph and paragraph (5) shall not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) income received from a governmental plan (as defined in section 414(d)) as a pension, annuity, or similar allowance as the result of the recipient becoming disabled <!-- PDFPage:1218 -->by reason of personal injuries or sickness, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) amounts received from a governmental plan by the beneficiaries, survivors, or the estate of an employee as the result of the death of the employee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Average compensation for high 3 years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a participant's high 3 years shall be the period of consecutive calendar years (not more than 3) during which the participant had the greatest aggregate compensation from the employer. In the case of an employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting for &ldquo;compensation from the employer&rdquo; the following: &ldquo;the participant's earned income (within the meaning of section 401(c)(2) but determined without regard to any exclusion under section 911)&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Total annual benefits not in excess of $10,000</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, the benefits payable with respect to a participant under any defined benefit plan shall be deemed not to exceed the limitation of this subsection if&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Compensation and benefits limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The provisions of subparagraph (A) shall apply to the limitations under paragraphs (1)(B) and (4), except that such subparagraph shall be applied with respect to years of service with an employer rather than years of participation in a plan.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">This paragraph shall not apply to a participant whose compensation for any 3 years during the 10-year period immediately preceding the year in which he separates from service exceeded the average compensation for such 3 years of all participants in such plan. This paragraph shall not apply to a participant for any period for which he is a participant under another plan to which this section applies which is maintained by an employer maintaining this plan. For any year for which the paragraph applies to benefits with respect to a participant, paragraph (1)(A) and subsection (d)(1)(A) shall be applied with respect to such participant by substituting one-half the amount otherwise applicable for such year under paragraph (1)(A) for &ldquo;$160,000&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) it is established to the satisfaction of a plan representative that the consent required under subparagraph (A) may not be obtained because there is no spouse, because the spouse cannot be located, or because of such other circumstances as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Any consent by a spouse (or establishment that the consent of a spouse may not be obtained) under the preceding sentence shall be effective only with respect to such spouse.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Requirement of spousal consent for using plan assets as security for loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each plan shall provide that, if section 401(a)(11) applies to a participant when part or all of the participant's accrued benefit is to be used as security for a loan, no portion of the participant's accrued benefit may be used as security for such loan unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the spouse of the participant (if any) consents in writing to such use during the 90-day period ending on the date on which the loan is to be so secured, and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In the case of a participant who is separated from service, the applicable election period under subparagraph (B) with respect to benefits accrued before the date of such separation from service shall not begin later than such date.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Regulatory authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary may by regulations limit the application of clause (i), except that such regulations may not limit the period of time by which the annuity starting date precedes the provision of the written explanation other than by providing that the annuity starting date may not be earlier than termination of employment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Waiver of 30-day period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A plan may permit a participant to elect (with any applicable spousal consent) to waive any requirement that the written explanation be provided at least 30 days before the annuity starting date (or to waive the 30-day requirement under subparagraph (A)) if the distribution commences more than 7 days after such explanation is provided.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definition of qualified preretirement survivor annuity</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the payments to the surviving spouse under such annuity are not less than the amounts which would be payable as a survivor annuity under the qualified joint and survivor annuity under the plan (or the actuarial equivalent thereof) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of a participant who dies after the date on which the participant attained the earliest retirement age, such participant had retired with an immediate qualified joint and survivor annuity on the day before the participant's date of death, or</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), a plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(11) merely because the plan provides that a qualified joint and survivor annuity (or a qualified preretirement survivor annuity) will not be provided unless the participant and spouse had been married throughout the 1-year period ending on the earlier of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the plan shall continue to maintain its funding standard account, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the plan's accumulated funding deficiency under section 412(a)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#418B_1_target" name="418B_1">1</a></sup> for such plan year shall be equal to the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the sum of the minimum contribution requirement for such plan year (taking into account any overburden credit under section 418C(a)) plus the plan's accumulated funding deficiency for the preceding plan year (determined under this section if the plan was in reorganization during such plan year or under section 412(a)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#418B_1_target" name="418B_1">1</a></sup> if the plan was not in reorganization), over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) amounts considered contributed by employers to or under the plan for the plan year (increased by any amount waived under subsection (f) for the plan year).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of withdrawal liability payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), withdrawal liability payments (whether or not received) which are due with respect to withdrawals before the end of the base plan year shall be considered amounts contributed by the employer to or under the plan if, as of the adjustment date, it was reasonable for the plan sponsor to anticipate that such payments would be made during the plan year.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this section for purposes of this subpart the minimum contribution requirement for a plan year in which a plan is in reorganization is an amount equal to the excess of&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustment for reductions in contribution base units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the plan's current contribution base for the plan year is less than the plan's valuation contribution base for the plan year, the minimum contribution requirement for such plan year shall be equal to the product of the amount determined under paragraph (1) (after any adjustment required by this subpart other than this paragraph) multiplied by a fraction&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Current contribution base</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subpart, a plan's current contribution base for a plan year is the number of contribution base units with respect to which contributions are required to be made under the plan for that plan year, determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the plan's valuation contribution base is the greater of the number of contribution base units for which contributions were received for the first or second plan year preceding the first plan year in which the plan is insolvent, adjusted as provided in clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Contribution base unit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subpart, the term &ldquo;contribution base unit&rdquo; means a unit with respect to which an employer has an obligation to contribute under a multiemployer plan (as defined in regulations prescribed by the Secretary).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if for the plan year a change in benefits is first required to be considered in computing the charges under section 412(b)(2)(A) or (B),<sup><a href="#418B_1_target" name="418B_1">1</a></sup> the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the increase in normal cost for a plan year determined under the entry age normal funding method due to increases in benefits described in section 418(b)(4)(A)(ii) (determined without regard to section 418(b)(4)(B)(ii)), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments the increase in the value of vested benefits under the plan due to increases in benefits described in clause (i) over&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Funding standard requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the funding standard requirement for any plan year is an <!-- PDFPage:1249 -->amount equal to the net charge to the funding standard account for such plan year (as defined in section 418(b)(2)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule for certain plans</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;418C. Overburden credit against minimum contribution requirement</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining the contribution under section 418B (before the application of section 418B(b)(2) or (d)), the plan sponsor of a plan which is overburdened for the plan year shall apply an overburden credit against the plan's minimum contribution requirement for the plan year (determined without regard to section 418B(b)(2) or (d) and without regard to this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definition of overburdened plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A plan is overburdened for a plan year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the average number of pay status participants under the plan in the base plan year exceeds the average of the number of active participants in the base plan year and the 2 plan years preceding the base plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the rate of employer contributions under the plan equals or exceeds the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such rate for the preceding plan year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such rate for the plan year preceding the first year in which the plan is in reorganization.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1250 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount of overburden credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of the overburden credit for a plan year is the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) one-half of the average guaranteed benefit paid for the base plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the overburden factor for the plan year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The amount of the overburden credit for a plan year shall not exceed the amount of the minimum contribution requirement for such year (determined without regard to this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Overburden factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the overburden factor of a plan for the plan year is an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the average number of pay status participants for the base plan year, reduced by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the average of the number of active participants for the base plan year and for each of the 2 plan years preceding the base plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Pay status participant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;pay status participant&rdquo; means, with respect to a plan, a participant receiving retirement benefits under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Number of active participants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The number of active participants for a plan year shall be the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number of active employees who are participants in the plan and on whose behalf contributions are required to be made during the plan year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of active employees who are not participants in the plan but who are in an employment unit covered by a collective bargaining agreement which requires the employees&rsquo; employer to contribute to the plan unless service in such employment unit was never covered under the plan or a predecessor thereof, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the total number of active employees attributed to employers who made payments to the plan for the plan year of withdrawal liability pursuant to part 1 of subtitle E of title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, determined by dividing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the total amount of such payments, by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount equal to the total contributions received by the plan during the plan year divided by the average number of active employees who were participants in the plan during the plan year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Secretary shall by regulations provide alternative methods of determining active participants where (by reason of irregular employment, contributions on a unit basis, or otherwise) this paragraph does not yield a representative basis for determining the credit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Average number</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;average number&rdquo; means, with respect to pay status participants for a plan year, a number equal to one-half the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number with respect to the plan as of the beginning of the plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number with respect to the plan as of the end of the plan year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Average guaranteed benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The average guaranteed benefit paid is 12 times the average monthly pension payment guaranteed under section 4022A(c)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 determined under the provisions of the plan in effect at the beginning of the first plan year in which the plan is in reorganization and without regard to section 4022A(c)(2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) First year in reorganization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The first year in which the plan is in reorganization is the first of a period of 1 or more consecutive plan years in which the plan has been in reorganization not taking into account any plan years the plan was in reorganization prior to any period of 3 or more consecutive plan years in which the plan was not in reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) No overburden credit in case of certain reductions in contributions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a plan is not eligible for an overburden credit for a plan year if the Secretary finds that the plan's current contribution base for any plan year was reduced, without a corresponding reduction in the plan's unfunded vested benefits attributable to pay status participants, as a result of a change in an agreement providing for employer contributions under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of certain withdrawals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a complete or partial withdrawal of an employer (within the meaning of part 1 of subtitle E of title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) does not impair a plan's eligibility for an overburden credit, unless the Secretary finds that a contribution base reduction described in paragraph (1) resulted from a transfer of liabilities to another plan in connection with the withdrawal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Mergers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if 2 or more multiemployer plans merge, the amount of the overburden credit which may be applied under this section with respect to the plan resulting from the merger for any of the 3 plan years ending after the effective date of the merger shall not exceed the sum of the used overburden credit for each of the merging plans for its last plan year ending before the effective date of the merger. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the used overburden credit is that portion of the credit which does not exceed the excess of the minimum contribution requirement determined without regard to any overburden credit under this section over the employer contributions required under the plan.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Adjustments in accrued benefits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding section 411, a multiemployer plan in reorganization may be amended, in accordance with this section, to reduce or eliminate accrued benefits attributable to employer contributions which, under section 4022A(b) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, are not eligible for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's guarantee. The preceding sentence shall only apply to accrued benefits under plan amendments (or plans) adopted after March 26, 1980, or under collective bargaining agreement entered into after March 26, 1980.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustment of vested benefits charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the minimum contribution requirement with respect to a plan for a plan year under section 418B(b), the vested benefits charge may be adjusted to reflect a plan amendment reducing benefits under this section or section 412(c)(8),<sup><a href="#418D_1_target" name="418D_1">1</a></sup> but only if the amendment is adopted and effective no later than 21/2 months after the end of the plan year, or within such extended period as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations under section 412(c)(10).<sup><a href="#418D_1_target" name="418D_1">1</a></sup></p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Restoration of previously reduced benefits</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A plan which has been amended to reduce accrued benefits under this section may be amended to increase or restore accrued benefits, or the rate of future benefit accruals, only if the plan is amended to restore levels of previously reduced accrued benefits of inactive participants and of participants who are within 5 years of attaining normal retirement age to at least the same extent as any such increase in accrued benefits or in the rate of future benefit accruals.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1252 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Benefit increases and benefit restorations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, in the case of a plan which has been amended under this section to reduce accrued benefits&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an increase in a benefit, or in the rate of future benefit accruals, shall be considered a benefit increase to the extent that the benefit, or the accrual rate, is thereby increased above the highest benefit level, or accrual rate, which was in effect under the terms of the plan before the effective date of the amendment reducing accrued benefits, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an increase in a benefit, or in the rate of future benefit accruals, shall be considered a benefit restoration to the extent that the benefit, or the accrual rate, is not thereby increased above the highest benefit level, or accrual rate, which was in effect under the terms of the plan immediately before the effective date of the amendment reducing accrued benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Uniformity in benefit restoration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a plan is amended to partially restore previously reduced accrued benefit levels, or the rate of future benefit accruals, the benefits of inactive participants shall be restored in at least the same proportions as other accrued benefits which are restored.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) No benefit increases in year of benefit reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No benefit increase under a plan may take effect in a plan year in which an amendment reducing accrued benefits under the plan, in accordance with this section, is adopted or first becomes effective.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, for a plan year&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Insolvency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A multiemployer plan is insolvent if the plan's available resources are not sufficient to pay benefits under the plan when due for the plan year, or if the plan is determined to be insolvent under subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Resource benefit level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;resource benefit level&rdquo; means the level of monthly benefits determined under subsections (c)(1) and (3) and (d)(3) to be the highest level which can be paid out of the plan's available resources.</p>

If the plan sponsor makes such a determination that the plan will be insolvent in any of the next 5 plan years, the plan sponsor shall make the comparison under this paragraph at least annually until the plan sponsor makes a determination that the plan will not be insolvent in any of the next 5 plan years.</p>
