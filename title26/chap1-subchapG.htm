<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Excess business holdings redemption needs</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) constituted excess business holdings on May 26, 1969, or would have constituted excess business holdings as of such date if there were taken into account (i) stock received pursuant to a will or trust described in subparagraph (A), and (ii) the reduction in the total outstanding stock of the corporation which would have resulted solely from the redemption of stock held by the private foundation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Obligations incurred to make redemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In applying paragraphs (1) and (2), the discharge of any obligation incurred to make a redemption described in such paragraphs shall be treated as the making of such redemption.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The application of this part to any taxable year before the first taxable year specified in paragraph (1) shall be made without regard to the fact that distributions in redemption coming within the terms of such paragraphs were subsequently made.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Stock not owned by individual</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Options</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any person has an option to acquire stock, such stock shall be considered as owned by such person.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Stock constructively owned by a person by reason of the application of paragraph (1) or (3), shall, for purposes of applying paragraph (1) or (2), be treated as actually owned by such person; but stock constructively owned by an individual by reason of the application of paragraph (2) shall not be treated as owned by him for purposes of again applying such paragraph in order to make another the constructive owner of such stock.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for purposes of the stock ownership requirement provided in section 542(a)(2), but only if the effect of the inclusion of all such securities is to make the corporation a personal holding company;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for purposes of section 543(a)(7) (relating to personal service contracts), but only if the effect of the inclusion of all such securities is to make the amounts therein referred to includible under such paragraph as personal holding company income;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for purposes of section 543(a)(6) (relating to the use of property by shareholders), but only if the effect of the inclusion of all such securities is to make the amounts therein referred to includible under such paragraphs as personal holding company income; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) for purposes of section 543(a)(4) (relating to copyright royalties), but only if the effect of the inclusion of all such securities is to make the amounts therein referred to includible under such paragraph as personal holding company income.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The requirement in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) that all convertible securities must be included if any are to be included shall be subject to the exception that, where some of the outstanding securities are convertible only after a later date than in the case of others, the class having the earlier conversion date may be included although the others are not included, but no convertible securities shall be included unless all outstanding securities having a prior conversion date are also included.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;545. Undistributed personal holding company income</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;undistributed personal holding company income&rdquo; means the taxable income of a personal holding company adjusted in the manner provided in subsections (b), (c), and (d), minus the dividends paid deduction as defined in section 561. In the case of a personal holding company which is a foreign corporation, not more than 10 percent in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned (within the meaning of section 958(a)) during the last half of the taxable year by United States persons, the term &ldquo;undistributed personal holding company income&rdquo; means the amount determined by multiplying the undistributed personal holding company income (determined without regard to this sentence) by the percentage in value of its outstanding stock which is the greatest percentage in value of its outstanding stock so owned by United States persons on any one day during such period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustments to taxable income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of subsection (a), the taxable income shall be adjusted as follows:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There shall be allowed as a deduction Federal income and excess profits taxes and income, war profits and excess profits taxes of foreign countries and possessions of the United States (to the extent not allowable as a deduction under section 275(a)(4)), accrued during the taxable year or deemed to be paid by a domestic corporation under section 902(a) or 960(a)(1) for the taxable year, but not including the accumulated earnings tax imposed by section 531, the personal holding company tax imposed by section 541, or the taxes imposed by corresponding sections of a prior income tax law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Charitable contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The deduction for charitable contributions provided under section 170 shall be allowed, but in computing such deduction the limitations in section 170(b)(1)(A), (B), and (D) shall apply, and section 170(b)(2) and (d)(1) shall not apply. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;contribution base&rdquo; when used in section 170(b)(1) means the taxable income computed with the adjustments (other than the 10-percent limitation) provided in section 170(b)(2) and (d)(1) and without deduction of the amount disallowed under paragraph (6) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special deductions disallowed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The special deductions for corporations provided in part VIII (except section 248) of subchapter B (section 241 and following, relating to the deduction for dividends received by corporations, etc.) shall not be allowed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Net operating loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The net operating loss deduction provided in section 172 shall not be allowed, but there shall be allowed as a deduction the amount of the net operating loss (as defined in section 172(c)) for the preceding taxable year computed without the deductions provided in part VIII (except section 248) of subchapter B.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Net capital gains</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There shall be allowed as a deduction the net capital gain for the taxable year, minus the taxes imposed by this subtitle attributable to such net capital gain. The taxes attributable to such net capital gain shall be an amount equal to the difference between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the taxes imposed by this subtitle (except the tax imposed by this part) for such year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such taxes computed for such year without including such excess in taxable income.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Expenses and depreciation applicable to property of the taxpayer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The aggregate of the deductions allowed under section 162 (relating to trade or business expenses) and section 167 (relating to depreciation), which are allocable to the operation and maintenance of property owned or operated by the corporation, shall be allowed only in an amount equal to the rent or other compensation received for the use of, or the right to use, the property, unless it is established (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) to the satisfaction of the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that the rent or other compensation received was the highest obtainable, or, if none was received, that none was obtainable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that the property was held in the course of a business carried on bona fide for profit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) either that there was reasonable expectation that the operation of the property would result in a profit, or that the property was necessary to the conduct of the business.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Special rule for capital gains and losses of foreign corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a foreign corporation, paragraph (5) shall be applied by taking into account only gains and losses which are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and are not exempt from tax under treaty.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certain foreign corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a foreign corporation all of the outstanding stock of which during the last half of the taxable year is owned by nonresident alien individuals (whether directly or indirectly through foreign estates, foreign trusts, foreign partnerships, or other foreign corporations), the taxable income for purposes of subsection (a) shall be the income which constitutes personal holding company income under section 543(a)(7), reduced by the deductions attributable to such income, and adjusted, with respect to such income, in the manner provided in subsection (b).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a determination (as defined in subsection (c)) with respect to a taxpayer establishes liability for personal holding company tax imposed by section 541 (or by a corresponding provision of a prior income tax law) for any taxable year, a deduction shall be allowed to the taxpayer for the amount of deficiency dividends (as defined in subsection (d)) for the purpose of determining the personal holding company tax for such year, but not for the purpose of determining interest, additional amounts, or assessable penalties computed with respect to such personal holding company tax.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rules for application of section</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Allowance of deduction</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Credit or refund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the allowance of a deficiency dividend deduction results in an overpayment of personal holding company tax for any taxable year, credit or refund with respect to such overpayment shall be made as if on the date of the de<!-- PDFPage:1127 -->termination 2 years remained before the expiration of the period of limitation on the filing of claim for refund for the taxable year to which the overpayment relates.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;deficiency dividends&rdquo; means the amount of the dividends paid by the corporation on or after the date of the determination and before filing claim under subsection (e), which would have been includible in the computation of the deduction for dividends paid under section 561 for the taxable year with respect to which the liability for personal holding company tax exists, if distributed during such taxable year. No dividends shall be considered as deficiency dividends for purposes of subsection (a) unless distributed within 90 days after the determination.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) For taxable year in which paid</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Deficiency dividends paid in any taxable year (to the extent of the portion thereof taken into account under subsection (a) in determining personal holding company tax) shall not be included in the amount of dividends paid for such year for purposes of computing the dividends paid deduction for such year and succeeding years.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) For prior taxable year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Deficiency dividends paid in any taxable year (to the extent of the portion thereof taken into account under subsection (a) in determining personal holding company tax) shall not be allowed for purposes of section 563(b) in the computation of the dividends paid deduction for the taxable year preceding the taxable year in which paid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Claim required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No deficiency dividend deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) unless (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) claim therefor is filed within 120 days after the determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Suspension of statute of limitations and stay of collection</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Suspension of running of statute</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the corporation files a claim, as provided in subsection (e), the running of the statute of limitations provided in section 6501 on the making of assessments, and the bringing of distraint or a proceeding in court for collection, in respect of the deficiency and all interest, additional amounts, or assessable penalties, shall be suspended for a period of 2 years after the date of the determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Stay of collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any deficiency with respect to the tax imposed by section 541 established by a determination under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the collection of the deficiency and all interest, additional amounts, and assessable penalties shall, except in cases of jeopardy, be stayed until the expiration of 120 days after the date of the determination, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if claim for deficiency dividend deduction is filed under subsection (e), the collection of such part of the deficiency as is not reduced by the deduction for deficiency dividends provided in subsection (a) shall be stayed until the date the claim is disallowed (in whole or in part) and if disallowed in part collection shall be made only with respect to the part disallowed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;551. Foreign personal holding company income taxed to United States shareholders</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The undistributed foreign personal holding company income of a foreign personal holding company shall be included in the gross income of the citizens or residents of the United States, domestic corporations, domestic partnerships, and estates or trusts (other than foreign estates or trusts), who are shareholders in such foreign personal holding company (hereinafter called &ldquo;United States shareholders&rdquo;) in the manner and to the extent set forth in this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount included in gross income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each United States shareholder, who was a shareholder on the day in the taxable year of the company which was the last day on which a United States group (as defined in section 552(a)(2)) existed with respect to the company, shall include in his gross income, as a dividend, for the taxable year in which or with which the taxable year of the company ends, the amount he would have received as a dividend (determined as if any distribution in liquidation actually made in such taxable year had not been made) if on such last day there had been distributed by the company, and received by the shareholders, an amount which bears the same ratio to the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the company for the taxable year as the portion of such taxable year up to and including such last day bears to the entire taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Information in return</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every United States shareholder who is required under subsection (b) to include in his gross income any amount with respect to the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of a foreign personal holding company and who, on the last day on which a United States group existed with respect to the company, owned 5 percent or more in value of the outstanding stock of such company, shall set forth in his return in complete detail the gross income, deductions and credits, taxable income, foreign personal holding company, and undistributed foreign personal holding company income of such company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effect on capital account of foreign personal holding company</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An amount which bears the same ratio to the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the foreign personal holding company for its taxable year as the portion of such taxable year up to and including the last day on which a United States group existed with respect to the company bears to the entire taxable year, shall, for the purpose of determining the effect of distributions in subsequent taxable years by the corporation, be considered as paid-in surplus or as a contribution to capital, and the accumulated earnings and profits as of the close of the taxable year shall be correspondingly reduced, if such amount or any portion thereof is required to be included as a dividend, directly or indirectly, in the gross income of United States shareholders.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Basis of stock in hands of shareholders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount required to be included in the gross income of a United States shareholder under subsection (b) shall, for the purpose of adjusting the basis of his stock with respect to which the distribution would have been made (if it had been made), be treated as having been reinvested by the shareholder as a contribution to the capital of the corporation; but only to the extent to which such amount is included in his gross income in his return, increased or decreased by any adjustment of such amount in the last determination of the shareholder's tax liability, made before the expiration of 6 years after the date prescribed by law for filing the return.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Stock held through foreign entity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, stock of a foreign personal holding company owned (directly or through the application of this subsection) by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a foreign partnership or an estate or trust which is a foreign estate or trust, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a foreign corporation which is not a foreign personal holding company,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be considered as being owned proportionately by its partners, beneficiaries, or shareholders. In any case to which the preceding sentence applies, the Secretary may by regulations provide that rules similar to the rules of section 1297(b)(5) shall apply, and provide for such other adjustments in the application of this subchapter as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Coordination with passive foreign investment company provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, but for this subsection, an amount would be included in the gross income of any person under subsection (a) and under section 1293 (relating to current taxation of income from certain passive foreign investment companies), such amount shall be included in the gross income of such person only under subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Cross references</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Application of subsection (b)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The rule provided in subsection (b)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall be applied in the case of every foreign corporation with respect to which a United States group exists on some day of its taxable year, for the purpose of determining whether such corporation meets the gross income requirements of section 552(a)(1).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustments to taxable income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of subsection (a), the taxable income shall be adjusted as follows:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There shall be allowed as a deduction Federal income and excess profits taxes and income, war profits, and excess-profits taxes of foreign countries and possessions of the United States (to the extent not allowable as a deduction under section 275(a)(4)), accrued during the taxable year, but not including the accumulated earnings tax imposed by section 531, the personal holding company tax imposed by section 541, or the taxes imposed by corresponding sections of a prior income tax law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Charitable contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The deduction for charitable contributions provided under section 170 shall be allowed, but in computing such deduction the limitations in section 170(b)(1)(A), (B), and (D) shall apply, and section 170(b)(2) and (d)(1) shall not apply. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;contribution base&rdquo; when used in section 170(b)(1) means the taxable income computed with the adjustments (other than the 10-percent limitation) provided in section 170(b)(2) and (d)(1) and without the deduction of the amounts disallowed under paragraphs (5) and (6) of this subsection or the inclusion in gross income of the amounts includible therein as dividends by reason of the application of the provisions of section 555(b) (relating to the inclusion in gross income of a foreign personal holding company of its distributive share of the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of another company in which it is a shareholder).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special deductions disallowed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The special deductions for corporations provided in part VIII (except section 248) of subchapter B (section 241 and following, relating to the deduction for dividends received by corporations, etc.) shall not be allowed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Net operating loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The net operating loss deduction provided in section 172 shall not be allowed, but there shall be allowed as a deduction the amount of the net operating loss (as defined in section 172(c)) for the preceding taxable year computed without the deductions provided in part VIII (except section 248) of subchapter B.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Expenses and depreciation applicable to property of the taxpayer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The aggregate of the deductions allowed under section 162 (relating to trade or business expenses) and section 167 (relating to depreciation) which are allocable to the operation and maintenance of property owned or operated by the company, shall be allowed only in an amount equal to the rent or other compensation received for the use of, or the right to use, the property, unless it is established (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) to the satisfaction of the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that the rent or other compensation received was the highest obtainable, or, if none was received, that none was obtainable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that the property was held in the course of a business carried on bona fide for profit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) either that there was reasonable expectation that the operation of the property would result in a profit, or that the property was necessary to the conduct of the business.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Taxes and contributions to pension trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The deductions provided in section 164(e) (relating to taxes of a shareholder paid by the corporation) and in section 404 (relating to pension, etc., trusts) shall not be allowed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;dividend&rdquo; shall, except as otherwise provided in this section, include only dividends described in section 316 (relating to definition of dividends for purposes of corporate distributions).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Distributions in liquidation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Except in the case of a personal holding company described in section 542 or a foreign personal holding company described in section 552&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of amounts distributed in liquidation, the part of such distribution which is properly chargeable to earnings and profits accumulated after February 28, 1913, shall be treated as a dividend for purposes of computing the dividends paid deduction, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a complete liquidation occurring within 24 months after the adoption of a plan of liquidation, any distribution within such period pursuant to such plan shall, to the extent of the earnings and profits (computed without regard to capital losses) of the corporation for the taxable year in which such distribution is made, be treated as a dividend for purposes of computing the dividends paid deduction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), a liquidation includes a redemption of stock to which section 302 applies. Except to the extent provided in regulations, the preceding sentence shall not apply in the case of any mere holding or investment company which is not a regulated investment company.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In the case of a complete liquidation of a personal holding company, occurring within 24 months after the adoption of a plan of liquidation, the amount of any distribution within such period pursuant to such plan shall be treated as a dividend for purposes of computing the dividends paid deduction, to the extent that such amount is distributed to corporate distributees and represents such corporate distributees&rsquo; allocable share of the undistributed personal holding company income for the taxable year of such distribution computed without regard to this paragraph and without regard to subparagraph (B) of section 316(b)(2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Preferential dividends</h4>

In the case of a distribution by a regulated investment company to a shareholder who made an initial investment of at least $10,000,000 in such company, such distribution shall not be treated as not being pro rata or as being preferential solely by reason of an increase in the distribution by reason of reductions in administrative expenses of the company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Distributions by a member of an affiliated group</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case where a corporation which is a member of an affiliated group of corporations filing or required to file a consolidated return for a taxable year is required to file a separate personal holding company schedule for such taxable year, a distribution by such corporation to another member of the affiliated group shall be considered as a dividend for purposes of computing the dividends paid deduction if such distribution would constitute a dividend under the other provisions of this section to a recipient which is not a member of an affiliated group.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special rules for real estate investment trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a real estate investment trust, in determining the amount of dividends under <!-- PDFPage:1137 -->section 316 for purposes of computing the dividends paid deduction, the earnings and profits of such trust for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1980, shall be increased by the total amount of gain (if any) on the sale or exchange of real property by such trust during such taxable year.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A consent dividend shall not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an amount specified in a consent which, if distributed in money, would constitute, or be part of, a distribution which would be disqualified for purposes of the dividends paid deduction under section 562(c) (relating to preferential dividends), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an amount specified in a consent which would not constitute a dividend (as defined in section 316) if the total amounts specified in consents filed by the corporation had been distributed in money to shareholders on the last day of the taxable year of such corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Effect of consent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of a consent dividend shall be considered, for purposes of this title&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a consent dividend which, if paid in money would be subject to the provisions of section 1441 (relating to withholding of tax on nonresident aliens) or section 1442 (relating to withholding of tax on foreign corporations), this section shall not apply unless the consent is accompanied by money, or such other medium of payment as the Secretary may by regulations authorize, in an amount equal to the amount that would be required to be deducted and withheld under sections 1441 or 1442 if the consent dividend had been, on the last day of the taxable year of the corporation, paid to the shareholder in money as a dividend. The amount accompanying the consent shall be credited against the tax imposed by this subtitle on the shareholder.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definitions</h4>
