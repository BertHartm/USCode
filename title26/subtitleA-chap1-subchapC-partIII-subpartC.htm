<h3 class="section-head">&sect;361. Nonrecognition of gain or loss to corporations; treatment of distributions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No gain or loss shall be recognized to a corporation if such corporation is a party to a reorganization and exchanges property, in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, solely for stock or securities in another corporation a party to the reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exchanges not solely in kind</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Gain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If subsection (a) would apply to an exchange but for the fact that the property received in exchange consists not only of stock or securities permitted by subsection (a) to be received without the recognition of gain, but also of other property or money, then&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Property distributed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the corporation receiving such other property or money distributes it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, no gain to the corporation shall be recognized from the exchange, but</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Property not distributed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the corporation receiving such other property or money does not distribute it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, the gain, if any, to the corporation shall be recognized.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The amount of gain recognized under subparagraph (B) shall not exceed the sum of the <!-- PDFPage:904 -->money and the fair market value of the other property so received which is not so distributed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If subsection (a) would apply to an exchange but for the fact that the property received in exchange consists not only of property permitted by subsection (a) to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, but also of other property or money, then no loss from the exchange shall be recognized.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of transfers to creditors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), any transfer of the other property or money received in the exchange by the corporation to its creditors in connection with the reorganization shall be treated as a distribution in pursuance of the plan of reorganization. The Secretary may prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to prevent avoidance of tax through abuse of the preceding sentence or subsection (c)(3). In the case of a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D) with respect to which stock or securities of the corporation to which the assets are transferred are distributed in a transaction which qualifies under section 355, this paragraph shall apply only to the extent that the sum of the money and the fair market value of other property transferred to such creditors does not exceed the adjusted bases of such assets transferred (reduced by the amount of the liabilities assumed (within the meaning of section 357(c))).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Treatment of distributions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), no gain or loss shall be recognized to a corporation a party to a reorganization on the distribution to its shareholders of property in pursuance of the plan of reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Distributions of appreciated property</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in a distribution referred to in paragraph (1), the corporation distributes property other than qualified property, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the fair market value of such property exceeds its adjusted basis (in the hands of the distributing corporation),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then gain shall be recognized to the distributing corporation as if such property were sold to the distributee at its fair market value.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Qualified property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;qualified property&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any stock in (or right to acquire stock in) the distributing corporation or obligation of the distributing corporation, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any stock in (or right to acquire stock in) another corporation which is a party to the reorganization or obligation of another corporation which is such a party if such stock (or right) or obligation is received by the distributing corporation in the exchange.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Treatment of liabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If any property distributed in the distribution referred to in paragraph (1) is subject to a liability or the shareholder assumes a liability of the distributing corporation in connection with the distribution, then, for purposes of subparagraph (A), the fair market value of such property shall be treated as not less than the amount of such liability.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of certain transfers to creditors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, any transfer of qualified property by the corporation to its creditors in connection with the reorganization shall be treated as a distribution to its shareholders pursuant to the plan of reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Coordination with other provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Section 311 and subpart B of part II of this subchapter shall not apply to any distribution referred to in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Cross reference</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>For provision providing for recognition of gain in certain distributions, see section 355(d).</strong></p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Property acquired by issuance of stock or as paid-in surplus</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If property was acquired on or after June 22, 1954, by a corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in connection with a transaction to which section 351 (relating to transfer of property to corporation controlled by transferor) applies, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as paid-in surplus or as a contribution to capital,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the basis shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor, increased in the amount of gain recognized to the transferor on such transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Transfers to corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If property was acquired by a corporation in connection with a reorganization to which this part applies, then the basis shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor, increased in the amount of gain recognized to the transferor on such transfer. This subsection shall not apply if the property acquired consists of stock or securities in a corporation a party to the reorganization, unless acquired by the exchange of stock or securities of the transferee (or of a corporation which is in control of the transferee) as the consideration in whole or in part for the transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rule for certain contributions to capital</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Property other than money</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2), if property other than money&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is acquired by a corporation, on or after June 22, 1954, as a contribution to capital, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is not contributed by a shareholder as such,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then the basis of such property shall be zero.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Money</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2), if money&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is received by a corporation, on or after June 22, 1954, as a contribution to capital, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is not contributed by a shareholder as such,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then the basis of any property acquired with such money during the 12-month period beginning on the day the contribution is received shall be reduced by the amount of such contribution. The excess (if any) of the amount of such contribution over the amount of the reduction under the preceding sentence shall be applied to the reduction (as of the last day of the period specified in the preceding sentence) of the basis of any other property held by the taxpayer. The particular properties to which the reductions required by this paragraph shall be allocated shall be determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on basis increase attributable to assumption of liability</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In no event shall the basis of any property be increased under subsection (a) or (b) above the fair market value of such property (determined without regard to section 7701(g)) by reason of any gain recognized to the transferor as a result of the assumption of a liability.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of gain not subject to tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in regulations, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) gain is recognized to the transferor as a result of an assumption of a nonrecourse liability by a transferee which is also secured by assets not transferred to such transferee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) no person is subject to tax under this title on such gain,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then, for purposes of determining basis under subsections (a) and (b), the amount of gain recognized by the transferor as a result of the assumption of the liability shall be determined as if the liability assumed by the transferee equaled such transferee's ratable portion of such liability determined on the basis of the relative fair market values (determined without regard to section 7701(g)) of all of the assets subject to such liability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitations on built-in losses</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitation on importation of built-in losses</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If in any transaction described in subsection (a) or (b) there would (but for this subsection) be an importation of a net built-in loss, the basis of each property described in subparagraph (B) which is acquired in such transaction shall (notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b)) be its fair market value immediately after such transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Property described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), property is described in this subparagraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) gain or loss with respect to such property is not subject to tax under this sub<!-- PDFPage:906 -->title in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) gain or loss with respect to such property is subject to such tax in the hands of the transferee immediately after such transfer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In any case in which the transferor is a partnership, the preceding sentence shall be applied by treating each partner in such partnership as holding such partner's proportionate share of the property of such partnership.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Importation of net built-in loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), there is an importation of a net built-in loss in a transaction if the transferee's aggregate adjusted bases of property described in subparagraph (B) which is transferred in such transaction would (but for this paragraph) exceed the fair market value of such property immediately after such transaction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation on transfer of built-in losses in section 351 transactions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) property is transferred by a transferor in any transaction which is described in subsection (a) and which is not described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the transferee's aggregate adjusted bases of such property so transferred would (but for this paragraph) exceed the fair market value of such property immediately after such transaction,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then, notwithstanding subsection (a), the transferee's aggregate adjusted bases of the property so transferred shall not exceed the fair market value of such property immediately after such transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Allocation of basis reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The aggregate reduction in basis by reason of subparagraph (A) shall be allocated among the property so transferred in proportion to their respective built-in losses immediately before the transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Election to apply limitation to transferor's stock basis</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) subparagraph (A) shall not apply, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the transferor's basis in the stock received for property to which subparagraph (A) does not apply by reason of the election shall not exceed its fair market value immediately after the transfer.</p>
