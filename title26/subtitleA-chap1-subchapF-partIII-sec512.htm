<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this title&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the term &ldquo;unrelated business taxable income&rdquo; means the gross income derived by any organization from any unrelated trade or business (as defined in section 513) regularly carried on by it, less the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the carrying on of such trade or business, both computed with the modifications provided in subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule for foreign organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an organization described in section 511 which is a foreign organization, the unrelated business taxable income shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) its unrelated business taxable income which is derived from sources within the United States and which is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) its unrelated business taxable income which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rules applicable to organizations described in paragraph (7), (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c)</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an organization described in paragraph (7), (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c), the term &ldquo;unrelated business taxable income&rdquo; means the gross income (excluding any exempt function income), less the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the production of the gross income (excluding exempt function income), both computed with the modifications provided in paragraphs (6), (10), (11), and (12) of subsection (b). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the deductions provided by sections 243, 244, and 245 (relating to dividends received by corporations) shall be treated as not directly connected with the production of gross income.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exempt function income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;exempt function income&rdquo; means the gross income from dues, fees, charges, or similar amounts paid by members of the organization as consideration for providing such members or their dependents or guests goods, facilities, or services in furtherance of the purposes constituting the basis for the exemption of the organization to which such income is paid. Such term also means all income (other than an amount equal to the gross income derived from any unrelated trade or business regularly carried on by such organization computed as if the organization were subject to paragraph (1)), which is set aside&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for a purpose specified in section 170(c)(4), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of an organization described in paragraph (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c), to provide for the payment of life, sick, accident, or other benefits,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">including reasonable costs of administration directly connected with a purpose described in clause (i) or (ii). If during the taxable year, an amount which is attributable to income so set aside is used for a purpose other than that described in clause (i) or (ii), such amount shall be included, under subparagraph (A), in unrelated business taxable income for the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Applicability to certain corporations described in section 501(c)(2)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a corporation described in section 501(c)(2), the income of which is payable to an organization described in paragraph (7), (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c), subparagraph (A) shall apply as if such cor<!-- PDFPage:1368 -->poration were the organization to which the income is payable. For purposes of the preceding sentence, such corporation shall be treated as having exempt function income for a taxable year only if it files a consolidated return with such organization for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Nonrecognition of gain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If property used directly in the performance of the exempt function of an organization described in paragraph (7), (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c) is sold by such organization, and within a period beginning 1 year before the date of such sale, and ending 3 years after such date, other property is purchased and used by such organization directly in the performance of its exempt function, gain (if any) from such sale shall be recognized only to the extent that such organization's sales price of the old property exceeds the organization's cost of purchasing the other property. For purposes of this subparagraph, the destruction in whole or in part, theft, seizure, requisition, or condemnation of property, shall be treated as the sale of such property, and rules similar to the rules provided by subsections (b), (c), (e), and (j) of section 1034 (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997) shall apply.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Limitation on amount of setaside in the case of organizations described in paragraph (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c)</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of any organization described in paragraph (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c), a set-aside for any purpose specified in clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) may be taken into account under subparagraph (B) only to the extent that such set-aside does not result in an amount of assets set aside for such purpose in excess of the account limit determined under section 419A (without regard to subsection (f)(6) thereof) for the taxable year (not taking into account any reserve described in section 419A(c)(2)(A) for post-retirement medical benefits).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Treatment of existing reserves for post-retirement medical or life insurance benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) Clause (i) shall not apply to any income attributable to an existing reserve for post-retirement medical or life insurance benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) For purposes of subclause (I), the term &ldquo;reserve for post-retirement medical or life insurance benefits&rdquo; means the greater of the amount of assets set aside for purposes of post-retirement medical or life insurance benefits to be provided to covered employees as of the close of the last plan year ending before the date of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 or on July 18, 1984.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) All payments during plan years ending on or after the date of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 of post-retirement medical benefits or life insurance benefits shall be charged against the reserve referred to in subclause (II). Except to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, all plans of an employer shall be treated as 1 plan for purposes of the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Treatment of tax exempt organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">This subparagraph shall not apply to any organization if substantially all of the contributions to such organization are made by employers who were exempt from tax under this chapter throughout the 5-taxable year period ending with the taxable year in which the contributions are made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule applicable to organizations described in section 501(c)(19)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an organization described in section 501(c)(19), the term &ldquo;unrelated business taxable income&rdquo; does not include any amount attributable to payments for life, sick, accident, or health insurance with respect to members of such organizations or their dependents which is set aside for the purpose of providing for the payment of insurance benefits or for a purpose specified in section 170(c)(4). If an amount set aside under the preceding sentence is used during the taxable year for a purpose other than a purpose described in the preceding sentence, such amount shall be included, under paragraph (1), in unrelated business taxable income for the taxable year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The term &ldquo;payments with respect to securities loans&rdquo; includes all amounts received in respect of a security (as defined in section 1236(c)) transferred by the owner to another person in a transaction to which section 1058 applies (whether or not title to the security remains in the name of the lender) including&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Subparagraph (A) shall apply only with respect to securities transferred pursuant to an agreement between the transferor and the transferee which provides for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) reasonable procedures to implement the obligation of the transferee to furnish to the transferor, for each business day during such period, collateral with a fair market value not less than the fair market value of the security at the close of business on the preceding business day,</p>
