<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7422. Civil actions for refund</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) No suit prior to filing claim for refund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Secretary, according to the provisions of law in that regard, and the regulations of the Secretary established in pursuance thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Protest or duress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such suit or proceeding may be maintained whether or not such tax, penalty, or sum has been paid under protest or duress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Suits against collection officer a bar</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A suit against any officer or employee of the United States (or former officer or employee) or his personal representative for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected shall be treated as if the United States had been a party to such suit in applying the doctrine of res judicata in all suits in respect of any internal revenue tax, and in all proceedings in the Tax Court and on review of decisions of the Tax Court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Credit treated as payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The credit of an overpayment of any tax in satisfaction of any tax liability shall, for the purpose of any suit for refund of such tax liability so satisfied, be deemed to be a payment in respect of such tax liability at the time such credit is allowed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Stay of proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary prior to the hearing of a suit brought by a taxpayer in a district court or the United States Court of Federal Claims for the recovery of any income tax, estate tax, gift tax, or tax imposed by chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 (or any penalty relating to such taxes) mails to the taxpayer a notice that a deficiency has been determined in respect of the tax which is the subject matter of taxpayer's suit, the proceedings in taxpayer's suit shall be stayed during the period of time in which the taxpayer may file a petition with the Tax Court for a redetermination of the asserted deficiency, and for 60 days thereafter. If the taxpayer files a petition with the Tax Court, the district court or the United States Court of Federal Claims, as the case may be, shall lose jurisdiction of taxpayer's suit to whatever extent jurisdiction is acquired by the Tax Court of the subject matter of taxpayer's suit for refund. If the taxpayer does not file a petition with the Tax Court for a redetermination of the asserted deficiency, the United States may counterclaim in the taxpayer's suit, or intervene in the event of a suit as described in subsection (c) (relating to suits against officers or employees of the United States), within the period of the stay of proceedings notwithstanding that the time for such pleading may have otherwise expired. The taxpayer shall have the burden of proof with respect to the issues raised by such counterclaim or intervention of the United States except as to the issue of whether the taxpayer has been guilty of fraud with intent to evade tax. This subsection shall not apply to a suit by a taxpayer which, prior to <!-- PDFPage:3340 -->the date of enactment of this title, is commenced, instituted, or pending in a district court or the United States Court of Federal Claims for the recovery of any income tax, estate tax, or gift tax (or any penalty relating to such taxes).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation on right of action for refund</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A suit or proceeding referred to in subsection (a) may be maintained only against the United States and not against any officer or employee of the United States (or former officer or employee) or his personal representative. Such suit or proceeding may be maintained against the United States notwithstanding the provisions of section 2502 of title 28 of the United States Code (relating to aliens&rsquo; privilege to sue) and notwithstanding the provisions of section 1502 of such title 28 (relating to certain treaty cases).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Misjoinder and change of venue</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a suit or proceeding brought in a United States district court against an officer or employee of the United States (or former officer or employee) or his personal representative is improperly brought solely by virtue of paragraph (1), the court shall order, upon such terms as are just, that the pleadings be amended to substitute the United States as a party for such officer or employee as of the time such action commenced, upon proper service of process on the United States. Such suit or proceeding shall upon request by the United States be transferred to the district or division where it should have been brought if such action initially had been brought against the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Special rules for certain excise taxes imposed by chapter 42 or 43</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Right to bring actions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to any taxable event, payment of the full amount of the first tier tax shall constitute sufficient payment in order to maintain an action under this section with respect to the second tier tax.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the terms &ldquo;taxable event&rdquo;, &ldquo;first tier tax&rdquo;, and &ldquo;second tier tax&rdquo; have the respective meanings given to such terms by section 4963.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation on suit for refund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No suit may be maintained under this section for the credit or refund of any tax imposed under section 4941, 4942, 4943, 4944, 4945, 4951, 4952, 4955, 4958, 4971, or 4975 with respect to any act (or failure to act) giving rise to liability for tax under such sections, unless no other suit has been maintained for credit or refund of, and no petition has been filed in the Tax Court with respect to a deficiency in, any other tax imposed by such sections with respect to such act (or failure to act).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Final determination of issues</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, any suit for the credit or refund of any tax imposed under section 4941, 4942, 4943, 4944, 4945, 4951, 4952, 4955, 4958, 4971, or 4975 with respect to any act (or failure to act) giving rise to liability for tax under such sections, shall constitute a suit to determine all questions with respect to any other tax imposed with respect to such act (or failure to act) under such sections, and failure by the parties to such suit to bring any such question before the Court shall constitute a bar to such question.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Special rule for actions with respect to partnership items</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No action may be brought for a refund attributable to partnership items (as defined in section 6231(a)(3)) except as provided in section 6228(b) or section 6230(c).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Special rule for actions with respect to tax shelter promoter and understatement penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No action or proceeding may be brought in the United States Court of Federal Claims for any refund or credit of a penalty imposed by section 6700 (relating to penalty for promoting abusive tax shelters, etc.) or section 6701 (relating to penalties for aiding and abetting understatement of tax liability).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Special rule for actions with respect to estates for which an election under section 6166 is made</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The district courts of the United States and the United States Court of Federal Claims shall not fail to have jurisdiction over any action brought by the representative of an estate to which this subsection applies to determine the correct amount of the estate tax liability of such estate (or for any refund with respect thereto) solely because the full amount of such liability has not been paid by reason of an election under section 6166 with respect to such estate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Estates to which subsection applies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall apply to any estate if, as of the date the action is filed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) no portion of the installments payable under section 6166 have been accelerated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) all such installments the due date for which is on or before the date the action is filed have been paid;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) there is no case pending in the Tax Court with respect to the tax imposed by section 2001 on the estate and, if a notice of deficiency under section 6212 with respect to such tax has been issued, the time for filing a petition with the Tax Court with respect to such notice has expired; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) no proceeding for declaratory judgment under section 7479 is pending.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Prohibition on collection of disallowed liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the court redetermines under paragraph (1) the estate tax liability of an estate, no part of such liability which is disallowed by a decision of such court which has become final may be collected by the Secretary, and amounts paid in excess of the installments determined by the court as currently due and payable shall be refunded.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case in which real property is redeemed by the United States pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary shall apply to the officer designated by local law, if any, for the documents necessary to evidence the fact of redemption and to record title to such property in the name of the United States. If no such officer is designated by local law or if such officer fails to issue such documents, the Secretary shall execute a certificate of redemption therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Filing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall, without delay, cause such documents or certificate to be duly recorded in the proper registry of deeds. If the State in which the real property redeemed by the United States is situated has not by law designated an office in which such certificate may be recorded, the Secretary shall file such certificate in the office of the clerk of the United States district court for the judicial district in which such property is situated.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A certificate of redemption executed by the Secretary shall constitute prima facie evidence of the regularity of such redemption and shall, when recorded, transfer to the United States all the rights, title, and interest in and to such property acquired by the person from whom the United States redeems such property by virtue of the sale of such property.</p>

Such action may be brought without regard to whether such property has been surrendered to or sold by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Surplus proceed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If property has been sold pursuant to a levy, any person (other than the person against whom is assessed the tax out of which such levy arose) who claims an interest in or lien on such property junior to that of the United States and to be legally entitled to the surplus proceeds of such sale may bring a civil action against the United States in a district court of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Substituted sale proceeds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If property has been sold pursuant to an agreement described in section 6325(b)(3) (relating to substitution of proceeds of sale), any person who claims to be legally entitled to all or any part of the amount held as a fund pursuant to such agreement may bring a civil action against the United States in a district court of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Substitution of value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a certificate of discharge is issued to any person under section 6325(b)(4) with respect to any property, such person may, within 120 days after the day on which such certificate is <!-- PDFPage:3345 -->issued, bring a civil action against the United States in a district court of the United States for a determination of whether the value of the interest of the United States (if any) in such property is less than the value determined by the Secretary. No other action may be brought by such person for such a determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjudication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The district court shall have jurisdiction to grant only such of the following forms of relief as may be appropriate in the circumstances:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Injunction</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Recovery of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the court determines that such property has been wrongfully levied upon, the court may&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Surplus proceeds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the court determines that the interest or lien of any party to an action under this section was transferred to the proceeds of a sale of such property, the court may grant a judgment in an amount equal to all or any part of the amount of the surplus proceeds of such sale.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Substituted sale proceeds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the court determines that a party has an interest in or lien on the amount held as a fund pursuant to an agreement described in section 6325(b)(3) (relating to substitution of proceeds of sale), the court may grant a judgment in an amount equal to all or any part of the amount of such fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Substitution of value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the court determines that the Secretary's determination of the value of the interest of the United States in the property for purposes of section 6325(b)(4) exceeds the actual value of such interest, the court shall grant a judgment ordering a refund of the amount deposited, and a release of the bond, to the extent that the aggregate of the amounts thereof exceeds such value determined by the court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Validity of assessment</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If an action, which could be brought against the United States under this section, is improperly brought against any officer or employee of the United States (or former officer or employee) or his personal representative, the court shall order, upon such terms as are just, that the pleadings be amended to substitute the United States as a party for such officer or employee as of the time such action was commenced upon proper service of process on the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Provision inapplicable</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Creation of remedy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In a case of actual controversy involving&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a determination by the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) with respect to the initial qualification or continuing qualification of an organization as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a) or as an organization described in section 170(c)(2),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with respect to the initial classification or continuing classification of an organization as a private foundation (as defined in section 509(a)),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) with respect to the initial classification or continuing classification of an organization as a private operating foundation (as defined in section 4942(j)(3)), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) with respect to the initial classification or continuing classification of a cooperative as an organization described in section 521(b) which is exempt from tax under section 521(a), or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a failure by the Secretary to make a determination with respect to an issue referred to in paragraph (1),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, the United States Tax Court, the United States Court of Federal Claims, or the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia may make a declaration with respect to such initial qualification or continuing qualification or with respect to such initial classification or continuing classification. Any such declaration shall have the force and effect of a decision of the Tax Court or a final judgment or decree of the district court or the Court of Federal Claims, as the case may be, and shall be reviewable as such. For purposes of this section, a determination with respect to a continuing qualification or continuing classification includes <!-- PDFPage:3347 -->any revocation of or other change in a qualification or classification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Petitioner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A pleading may be filed under this section only by the organization the qualification or classification of which is at issue.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exhaustion of administrative remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A declaratory judgment or decree under this section shall not be issued in any proceeding unless the Tax Court, the Court of Federal Claims, or the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia determines that the organization involved has exhausted administrative remedies available to it within the Internal Revenue Service. An organization requesting the determination of an issue referred to in subsection (a)(1) shall be deemed to have exhausted its administrative remedies with respect to a failure by the Secretary to make a determination with respect to such issue at the expiration of 270 days after the date on which the request for such determination was made if the organization has taken, in a timely manner, all reasonable steps to secure such determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Time for bringing action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary sends by certified or registered mail notice of his determination with respect to an issue referred to in subsection (a)(1) to the organization referred to in paragraph (1), no proceeding may be initiated under this section by such organization unless the pleading is filed before the 91st day after the date of such mailing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Nonapplication for certain revocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No action may be brought under this section with respect to any revocation of status described in section 6033(j)(1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Validation of certain contributions made during pendency of proceedings</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the issue referred to in subsection (a)(1) involves the revocation of a determination that the organization is described in section 170(c)(2),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a proceeding under this section is initiated within the time provided by subsection (b)(3), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a decision of the Tax Court has become final (within the meaning of section 7481), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a judgment of the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia has been entered, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a judgment of the Court of Federal Claims, has been entered,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">and such decision or judgment, as the case may be, determines that the organization was not described in section 170(c)(2),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then, notwithstanding such decision or judgment, such organization shall be treated as having been described in section 170(c)(2) for purposes of section 170 for the period beginning on the date on which the notice of the revocation was published and ending on the date on which the court first determined in such proceeding that the organization was not described in section 170(c)(2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall apply only&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) with respect to individuals, and only to the extent that the aggregate of the contributions made by any individual to or for the use of the organization during the period specified in paragraph (1) does not exceed $1,000 (for this purpose treating a husband and wife as one contributor), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with respect to organizations described in section 170(c)(2) which are exempt from tax under section 501(a) (for this purpose excluding any such organization with respect to which there is pending a proceeding to revoke the determination under section 170(c)(2)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to any individual who was responsible, in whole or in part, for the activities (or failures to act) on the part of the organization which were the basis for the revocation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Subpoena power for district court for District of Columbia</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any action brought under this section in the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia, a subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a trial or hearing may be served at any place in the United States.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any administrative or court proceeding which is brought by or against the United States in connection with the determination, collection, or refund of any tax, interest, or penalty under this title, the prevailing party may be awarded a judgment or a settlement for&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) reasonable litigation costs incurred in connection with such court proceeding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirement that administrative remedies be exhausted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A judgment for reasonable litigation costs shall not be awarded under subsection (a) in any court proceeding unless the court determines that the prevailing party has exhausted the administrative remedies available to such party within the Internal Revenue Service. Any failure to agree to an extension of the time for the assessment of any tax shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the prevailing party meets the requirements of the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Only costs allocable to the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An award under subsection (a) shall be made only for reasonable litigation and administrative costs which are allocable to the United States and not to any other party.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Costs denied where party prevailing protracts proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No award for reasonable litigation and administrative costs may be made under subsection (a) with respect to any portion of the administrative or court proceeding during which the prevailing party has unreasonably protracted such proceeding.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Period for applying to IRS for administrative costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An award may be made under subsection (a) by the Internal Revenue Service for reasonable administrative costs only if the prevailing party files an application with the Internal Revenue Service for such costs before the 91st day after the date on which the final decision of the Internal Revenue Service as to the determination of the tax, interest, or penalty is mailed to such party.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project which is found by the court to be necessary for the preparation of the party's case, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) reasonable fees paid or incurred for the services of attorneys in connection with the court proceeding, except that such fees shall not be in excess of $125 per hour unless the court determines that a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for such proceeding, the difficulty of the issues presented in the case, or the local availability of tax expertise, justifies a higher rate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In the case of any calendar year beginning after 1996, the dollar amount referred to in clause (iii) shall be increased by an amount equal to such dollar amount multiplied by the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for such calendar year, by substituting &ldquo;calendar year 1995&rdquo; for &ldquo;calendar year 1992&rdquo; in subparagraph (B) thereof. If any dollar amount after being increased under the preceding sentence is not a multiple of $10, such dollar amount shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) expenses, costs, and fees described in paragraph (1)(B), except that any determina<!-- PDFPage:3351 -->tion made by the court under clause (ii) or (iii) thereof shall be made by the Internal Revenue Service in cases where the determination under paragraph (4)(C) of the awarding of reasonable administrative costs is made by the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Such term shall only include costs incurred on or after whichever of the following is the earliest: (i) the date of the receipt by the taxpayer of the notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals; (ii) the date of the notice of deficiency; or (iii) the date on which the first letter of proposed deficiency which allows the taxpayer an opportunity for administrative review in the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals is sent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Attorneys&rsquo; fees</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), fees for the services of an individual (whether or not an attorney) who is authorized to practice before the Tax Court or before the Internal Revenue Service shall be treated as fees for the services of an attorney.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Pro bono services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The court may award reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees under subsection (a) in excess of the attorneys&rsquo; fees paid or incurred if such fees are less than the reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees because an individual is representing the prevailing party for no fee or for a fee which (taking into account all the facts and circumstances) is no more than a nominal fee. This subparagraph shall apply only if such award is paid to such individual or such individual's employer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Prevailing party</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;prevailing party&rdquo; means any party in any proceeding to which subsection (a) applies (other than the United States or any creditor of the taxpayer involved)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) has substantially prevailed with respect to the most significant issue or set of issues presented, and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception if United States establishes that its position was substantially justified</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A party shall not be treated as the prevailing party in a proceeding to which subsection (a) applies if the United States establishes that the position of the United States in the proceeding was substantially justified.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Presumption of no justification if Internal Revenue Service did not follow certain published guidance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), the position of the United States shall be presumed not to be substantially justified if the Internal Revenue Service did not follow its applicable published guidance in the administrative proceeding. Such presumption may be rebutted.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Effect of losing on substantially similar issues</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In determining for purposes of clause (i) whether the position of the United States was substantially justified, the court shall take into account whether the United States has lost in courts of appeal for other circuits on substantially similar issues.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Applicable published guidance</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">A report upon any proceeding instituted before the Tax Court and a decision thereon shall be made as quickly as practicable. The decision shall be made by a judge in accordance with the report of the Tax Court, and such decision so made shall, when entered, be the decision of the Tax Court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inclusion of findings of fact or opinions in report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the duty of the Tax Court and of each division to include in its report upon any proceeding its findings of fact or opinion or memorandum opinion. The Tax Court shall report in writing all its findings of fact, opinions, and memorandum opinions. Subject to such conditions as the Tax Court may by rule provide, the requirements of this subsection and of section 7460 are met if findings of fact or opinion are stated orally and recorded in the transcript of the proceedings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Date of decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A decision of the Tax Court (except a decision dismissing a proceeding for lack of jurisdiction) shall be held to be rendered upon the date that an order specifying the amount of the deficiency is entered in the records of the Tax Court or, in the case of a declaratory judgment proceeding under part IV of this subchapter or under section 7428 or in the case of an action brought under section 6226, 6228(a),<sup><a href="#7459_1_target" name="7459_1">1</a></sup> 6247, or 6252, the date of the court's order entering the decision. If the Tax Court dismisses a proceeding for reasons other than lack of jurisdiction and is unable from the record to determine the amount of the deficiency determined by the Secretary, or if the Tax Court dismisses a proceeding for lack of jurisdiction, an order to that effect shall be entered in the records of the Tax Court, and the decision of the Tax Court shall be held to be rendered upon the date of such entry.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effect of decision dismissing petition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a petition for a redetermination of a deficiency has been filed by the taxpayer, a decision of the Tax Court dismissing the proceeding shall be considered as its decision that the deficiency is the amount determined by the Secretary. An order specifying such amount shall be entered in the records of the Tax Court unless the Tax Court cannot determine such amount from the record in the proceeding, or unless the dismissal is for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3380 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect of decision that tax is barred by limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the assessment or collection of any tax is barred by any statute of limitations, the decision of the Tax Court to that effect shall be considered as its decision that there is no deficiency in respect of such tax.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Findings of fact as evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The findings of the Board of Tax Appeals made in connection with any decision prior to February 26, 1926, shall, notwithstanding the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 9), continue to be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Creation of remedy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In a case of actual controversy involving&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a determination by the Secretary with respect to the initial qualification or continuing qualification of a retirement plan under subchapter D of chapter 1, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a failure by the Secretary to make a determination with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such initial qualification, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such continuing qualification if the controversy arises from a plan amendment or plan termination,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, the Tax Court may make a declaration with respect to such initial qualification or continuing qualification. Any such declaration shall have the force and effect of a decision of the Tax Court and shall be reviewable as such. For purposes of this section, a determination with respect to a continuing qualification includes any revocation of or other change in a qualification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Petitioner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A pleading may be filed under this section only by a petitioner who is the employer, the plan administrator, an employee who has qualified under regulations prescribed by the Secretary as an interested party for purposes of pursuing administrative remedies within the Internal Revenue Service, or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the filing of a pleading by any petitioner may be held by the Tax Court to be premature, unless the petitioner establishes to the satisfaction of the court that he has complied with the requirements prescribed by regulations of the Secretary with respect to notice to other interested parties of the filing of the request for a determination referred to in subsection (a).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3385 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exhaustion of administrative remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Tax Court shall not issue a declaratory judgment or decree under this section in any proceeding unless it determines that the petitioner has exhausted administrative remedies available to him within the Internal Revenue Service. A petitioner shall not be deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to a failure by the Secretary to make a determination with respect to initial qualification or continuing qualification of a retirement plan before the expiration of 270 days after the request for such determination was made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Plan put into effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No proceeding may be maintained under this section unless the plan (and, in the case of a controversy involving the continuing qualification of the plan because of an amendment to the plan, the amendment) with respect to which a decision of the Tax Court is sought has been put into effect before the filing of the pleading. A plan or amendment shall not be treated as not being in effect merely because under the plan the funds contributed to the plan may be refunded if the plan (or the plan as so amended) is found to be not qualified.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Time for bringing action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary sends by certified or registered mail notice of his determination with respect to the qualification of the plan to the persons referred to in paragraph (1) (or, in the case of employees referred to in paragraph (1), to any individual designated under regulations prescribed by the Secretary as a representative of such employee), no proceeding may be initiated under this section by any person unless the pleading is filed before the ninety-first day after the day after such notice is mailed to such person (or to his designated representative, in the case of an employee).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Retirement plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;retirement plan&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In a case of actual controversy involving a determination by the Secretary of (or a failure by the Secretary to make a determination with respect to)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) whether an election may be made under section 6166 (relating to extension of time for <!-- PDFPage:3387 -->payment of estate tax where estate consists largely of interest in closely held business) with respect to an estate (or with respect to any property included therein), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) whether the extension of time for payment of tax provided in section 6166(a) has ceased to apply with respect to an estate (or with respect to any property included therein),</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exhaustion of administrative remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The court shall not issue a declaratory judgment or decree under this section in any proceeding unless it determines that the petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies within the Internal Revenue Service. A petitioner shall be deemed to have exhausted its administrative remedies with respect to a failure of the Secretary to make a determination at the expiration of 180 days after the date on which the request for such determination was made if the petitioner has taken, in a timely manner, all reasonable steps to secure such determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Time for bringing action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary sends by certified or registered mail notice of his determination as described in subsection (a) to the petitioner, no proceeding may be initiated under this section unless the pleading is filed before the 91st day after the date of such mailing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Extension of time to file refund suit</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Reviewable decisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsections (b), (c), and (d), the decision of the Tax Court shall become final&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Timely notice of appeal not filed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the expiration of the time allowed for filing a notice of appeal, if no such notice has been duly filed within such time; or</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Decision affirmed or appeal dismissed</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Petition for certiorari not filed on time</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon the expiration of the time allowed for filing a petition for certiorari, if the decision of the Tax Court has been affirmed or the appeal dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals and no petition for certiorari has been duly filed; or</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Petition for certiorari denied</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon the denial of a petition for certiorari, if the decision of the Tax Court has been affirmed or the appeal dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals; or</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) After mandate of Supreme Court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon the expiration of 30 days from the date of issuance of the mandate of the Supreme Court, if such Court directs that the decision of the Tax Court be affirmed or the appeal dismissed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Decision modified or reversed</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Upon mandate of Supreme Court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Supreme Court directs that the decision of the Tax Court be modified or reversed, the decision of the Tax Court rendered in accordance with the mandate of the Supreme Court shall become final upon the <!-- PDFPage:3388 -->expiration of 30 days from the time it was rendered, unless within such 30 days either the Secretary or the taxpayer has instituted proceedings to have such decision corrected to accord with the mandate, in which event the decision of the Tax Court shall become final when so corrected.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Upon mandate of the Court of Appeals</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then the decision of the Tax Court rendered upon such rehearing shall become final in the same manner as though no prior decision of the Tax Court has been rendered.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Definition of &ldquo;mandate&rdquo;</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As used in this section, the term &ldquo;mandate&rdquo;, in case a mandate has been recalled prior to the expiration of 30 days from the date of issuance thereof, means the final mandate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Nonreviewable decisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The decision of the Tax Court in a proceeding conducted under section 7436(c) or 7463 shall become final upon the expiration of 90 days after the decision is entered.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (a), if, within 1 year after the date the decision of the Tax Court becomes final under subsection (a) in a case to which this subsection applies, the taxpayer files a motion in the Tax Court for a redetermination of the amount of interest involved, then the Tax Court may reopen the case solely to determine whether the taxpayer has made an overpayment of such interest or the Secretary has made an underpayment of such interest and the amount thereof.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Cases to which this subsection applies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall apply where&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) an assessment has been made by the Secretary under section 6215 which includes interest as imposed by this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the taxpayer has paid the entire amount of the deficiency plus interest claimed by the Secretary, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Tax Court finds under section 6512(b) that the taxpayer has made an overpayment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Tax Court determines under this subsection that the taxpayer has made an overpayment of interest or that the Secretary has made an underpayment of interest, then that determination shall be treated under section 6512(b)(1) as a determination of an overpayment of tax. An order of the Tax Court redetermining interest, when entered upon the records of the court, shall be reviewable in the same manner as a decision of the Tax Court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Decisions relating to estate tax extended under section 6166</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If with respect to a decedent's estate subject to a decision of the Tax Court&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the time for payment of an amount of tax imposed by chapter 11 is extended under section 6166, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there is treated as an administrative expense under section 2053 either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any amount of interest which a decedent's estate pays on any portion of the tax imposed by section 2001 on such estate for which the time of payment is extended under section 6166, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) interest on any estate, succession, legacy, or inheritance tax imposed by a State on such estate during the period of the extension of time for payment under section 6166,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then, upon a motion by the petitioner in such case in which such time for payment of tax has been extended under section 6166, the Tax Court may reopen the case solely to modify the Court's decision to reflect such estate's entitlement to a deduction for such administration expenses under section 2053 and may hold further trial solely with respect to the claim for such deduction if, within the discretion of the Tax Court, such a hearing is deemed necessary. An order of the Tax Court disposing of a motion under this subsection shall be reviewable in the same manner as a decision of the Tax Court, but only with respect to the matters determined in such order.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Jurisdiction</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The United States Courts of Appeals (other than the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) shall have exclusive jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Tax Court, except as provided in section 1254 of Title 28 of the United States Code, in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury; and the judgment of any such court shall be final, except that it shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari, in the manner provided in section 1254 of Title 28 of the United States Code.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Interlocutory orders</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">When any judge of the Tax Court includes in an interlocutory order a statement that a controlling question of law is involved with respect to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from that order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation, the United States Court of Appeals may, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order, if application is made to it within 10 days after the entry of such order. Neither the application for nor the granting of an appeal under this paragraph shall stay proceedings in the Tax Court, unless a stay is ordered by a judge of the Tax Court or by the United States Court of Appeals which has jurisdiction of the appeal or a judge of that court.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Order treated as Tax Court decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subsections (b) and (c), an order described in this paragraph shall be treated as a decision of the Tax Court.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Venue for review of subsequent proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a United States Court of Appeals permits an appeal to be taken from an order described in subparagraph (A), except as provided in subsection (b)(2), any subsequent review of the decision of the Tax Court in the proceeding shall be made by such Court of Appeals.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certain orders entered under section 6213(a)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An order of the Tax Court which is entered under authority of section 6213(a) and which resolves a proceeding to restrain assessment or collection shall be treated as a decision of the Tax Court for purposes of this section and shall be subject to the same review by the United States Court of Appeals as a similar order of a district court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Venue</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), such decisions may be reviewed by the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which is located&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a petitioner seeking redetermination of tax liability other than a corporation, the legal residence of the petitioner,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a corporation seeking redetermination of tax liability, the principal <!-- PDFPage:3390 -->place of business or principal office or agency of the corporation, or, if it has no principal place of business or principal office or agency in any judicial circuit, then the office to which was made the return of the tax in respect of which the liability arises,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of a person seeking a declaratory decision under section 7476, the principal place of business, or principal office or agency of the employer,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in the case of an organization seeking a declaratory decision under section 7428, the principal office or agency of the organization,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) in the case of a petition under section 6226, 6228(a), 6247, or 6252, the principal place of business of the partnership, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) in the case of a petition under section 6234(c)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the legal residence of the petitioner if the petitioner is not a corporation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the place or office applicable under subparagraph (B) if the petitioner is a corporation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If for any reason no subparagraph of the preceding sentence applies, then such decisions may be reviewed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. For purposes of this paragraph, the legal residence, principal place of business, or principal office or agency referred to herein shall be determined as of the time the petition seeking redetermination of tax liability was filed with the Tax Court or as of the time the petition seeking a declaratory decision under section 7428 or 7476 or the petition under section 6226, 6228(a), or 6234(c), was filed with the Tax Court.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) By agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), such decisions may be reviewed by any United States Court of Appeals which may be designated by the Secretary and the taxpayer by stipulation in writing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Declaratory judgment actions relating to status of certain governmental obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any decision of the Tax Court in a proceeding under section 7478, such decision may only be reviewed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</p>
