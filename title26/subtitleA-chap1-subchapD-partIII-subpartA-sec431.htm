<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) except as provided in paragraph (2), the amount, determined as of the end of the plan year, equal to the excess (if any) of the total charges to the funding standard account of the plan for all plan years (beginning with the first plan year for which this part applies to the plan) over the total credits to such account for such years, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the multiemployer plan is in reorganization for any plan year, the accumulated funding deficiency of the plan determined under section 4243 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Funding standard account</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Account required</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net experience gain (if any) under the plan, over a period of 15 plan years, and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule for amounts first amortized in plan years before 2008</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any amount amortized under section 412(b) (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Pension Protection Act of 2006) over any period beginning with a plan year beginning before 2008 in lieu of the amortization described in paragraphs (2)(B) and (3)(B), such amount shall continue to be amortized under such section as so in effect.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The funding standard account (and items therein) shall be charged or credited (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury) with interest at the appropriate rate consistent with the rate or rates of interest used under the plan to determine costs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount received by a multiemployer plan in payment of all or part of an employer's withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 shall be considered an amount contributed by the employer to or under the plan. The Secretary may prescribe by regulation additional charges and credits to a multiemployer plan's funding standard account to the extent necessary to prevent withdrawal liability payments from being unduly reflected as advance funding for plan liabilities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjustments when a multiemployer plan leaves reorganization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a multiemployer plan is not in reorganization in the plan year but was in reorganization in the immediately preceding plan year, any balance in the funding standard account at the close of such immediately preceding plan year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall be eliminated by an offsetting credit or charge (as the case may be), but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall be taken into account in subsequent plan years by being amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 30 plan years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent of any accumulated funding deficiency under section 4243(a) of such Act as of the end of the last plan year that the plan was in reorganization.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount paid by a plan during a plan year to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation pursuant to section 4222 of such Act or to a fund exempt under section 501(c)(22) pursuant to section 4223 of such Act shall reduce the amount of contributions considered received by the plan for the plan year.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1266 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Interim withdrawal liability payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount paid by an employer pending a final determination of the employer's withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of title IV of such Act and subsequently refunded to the employer by the plan shall be charged to the funding standard account in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Election for deferral of charge for portion of net experience loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an election is in effect under section 412(b)(7)(F) (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Pension Protection Act of 2006) for any plan year, the funding standard account shall be charged in the plan year to which the portion of the net experience loss deferred by such election was deferred with the amount so deferred (and paragraph (2)(B)(iii) shall not apply to the amount so charged).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount of any financial assistance from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to any plan, and any repayment of such amount, shall be taken into account under this section and section 412 in such manner as is determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Short-term benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent that any plan amendment increases the unfunded past service liability under the plan by reason of an increase in benefits which are not payable as a life annuity but are payable under the terms of the plan for a period that does not exceed 14 years from the effective date of the amendment, paragraph (2)(B)(ii) shall be applied separately with respect to such increase in unfunded past service liability by substituting the number of years of the period during which such benefits are payable for &ldquo;15&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Additional rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determinations to be made under funding method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this part, normal costs, accrued liability, past service liabilities, and experience gains and losses shall be determined under the funding method used to determine costs under the plan.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Election with respect to bonds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The value of a bond or other evidence of indebtedness which is not in default as to principal or interest may, at the election of the plan administrator, be determined on an amortized basis running from initial cost at purchase to par value at maturity or earliest call date. Any election under this subparagraph shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulations provide, shall apply to all such evidences of indebtedness, and may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which, in combination, offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of certain changes as experience gain or loss</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Information under clause (ii) shall, in accordance with regulations, be actuarially adjusted to reflect significant differences in participants.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A change in funding method to use a prior year valuation, as provided in clause (ii), may not be made unless as of the valuation date within the prior plan year, the value of the assets of the plan are not less than 125 percent of the plan's current liability (as defined in paragraph (6)(D) without regard to clause (iv) thereof).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such extension would carry out the purposes of this Act&nbsp;<sup><a href="#431_1_target" name="431_1">1</a></sup> and would provide adequate protection for participants under the plan and their beneficiaries, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the failure to permit such extension would&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) result in a substantial risk to the voluntary continuation of the plan, or a substantial curtailment of pension benefit levels or employee compensation, and</p>
