<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 7 percentage points for coal of more than 9,000 Btu,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 6 percentage points for coal of 7,000 to 9,000 Btu, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) 4 percentage points for coal of less than 7,000 Btu.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No use of technology (or level of emission reduction solely by reason of the use of the technology), and no achievement of any emission reduction by the demonstration of any technology or performance level, by or at one or more facilities with respect to which a credit is allowed under this section, shall be considered to indicate that the technology or performance level is&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Competitive certification awards modification authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In implementing this section or section 48B, the Secretary is directed to modify the terms of any competitive certification award and any associated closing agreement where such modification&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is consistent with the objectives of such section,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is requested by the recipient of the competitive certification award, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) involves moving the project site to improve the potential to capture and sequester carbon dioxide emissions, reduce costs of transporting feedstock, and serve a broader customer base,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">unless the Secretary determines that the dollar amount of tax credits available to the taxpayer under such section would increase as a result of the modification or such modification would result in such project not being originally certified. In considering any such modification, the Secretary shall consult with other relevant Federal agencies, including the Department of Energy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Recapture of credit for failure to sequester</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide for recapturing the benefit of any credit allowable under subsection (a) with respect to any project which fails to attain or maintain the separation and sequestration requirements of subsection (e)(1)(G).</p>
