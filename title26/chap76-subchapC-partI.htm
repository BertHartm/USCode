<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an individual for whom an election to receive retired pay under subsection (d) is in effect&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) 1-year forfeiture for failure to perform judicial duties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If such individual during any calendar year fails to perform judicial duties required of him by subsection (c), such individual shall forfeit all rights to retired pay under subsection (d) for the 1-year period which begins on the 1st day on which he so fails to perform such duties.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Permanent forfeiture of retired pay where certain non-Government services performed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If such individual performs (or supervises or directs the performance of) legal or accounting services in the field of Federal taxation for his client, his employer, or any of his employer's clients, such individual shall forfeit all rights to retired pay under subsection (d) for all periods beginning on or after the 1st day on which he engages in any such activity. The preceding sentence shall not apply to any civil office or employment under the Government of the United States.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Payments to persons under legal disability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where any payment under this section is to be made to a minor, or to a person mentally incompetent or under other legal disability adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, such payment may be made to the person who is constituted guardian or other fiduciary by the law of the State of residence of such claimant or is otherwise legally vested with the care of the claimant or his estate. Where no guardian or other fiduciary of the person under legal disability has been appointed under the laws of the State of residence of the claimant, the chief judge shall determine the person who is otherwise legally vested with the care of the claimant or his estate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Method of payment of annuities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Annuities granted under the terms of this section shall accrue monthly and shall be due and payable in monthly installments on the first business day of the month following the month or other period for which the annuity shall have accrued.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Computation of annuities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The annuity of the surviving spouse of a judge electing under subsection (b) shall be an amount equal to the sum of 1.5 percent of the average annual salary (whether judge's salary or compensation for other allowable service) received by such judge for judicial service (including periods in which he received retired pay under section 7447(d)) or for any other prior allowable service during the period of 3 consecutive years in which he received the largest such average annual salary, multiplied by the sum of his years of such judicial service, his years of prior allowable service as a Senator, Representative, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner in Congress, his years of prior allowable service performed as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States, and his years, not exceeding 15, of prior allowable service performed as a congressional employee (as defined in section 2107 of title 5 of the United States Code,<sup><a href="#7448_1_target" name="7448_1">1</a></sup> and (2) three-fourths of 1 percent of such average annual salary multiplied by his years of any other prior allowable service, except that such annuity shall not exceed an amount equal to 50 percent of such average annual salary, nor be less than an amount equal to 25 percent of such average annual salary, and shall be further reduced in accordance with subsection (d) (if applicable). In determining the period of 3 consecutive years re<!-- PDFPage:3247 -->ferred to in the preceding sentence, there may not be taken into account any period for which an election under section 7447(f)(4) is in effect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Includible service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the provisions of subsection (d), the years of service of a judge which are allowable as the basis for calculating the amount of the annuity of his surviving spouse shall include his years of service as a member of the United States Board of Tax Appeals, as a judge of the Tax Court of the United States, and as a judge of the Tax Court, his years of service as a Senator, Representative, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner in Congress, his years of active service as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States not exceeding 5 years in the aggregate and not including any such service for which credit is allowed for the purposes of retirement or retired pay under any other provision of law, and his years of any other civilian service within the purview of section 8332 of title 5 of the United States Code.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Simultaneous entitlement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prevent a surviving spouse eligible therefor from simultaneously receiving an annuity under this section and any annuity to which such spouse would otherwise be entitled under any other law without regard to this section, but in computing such other annuity service used in the computation of such spouse's annuity under this section shall not be credited.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(p) Estimates of expenditures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The chief judge shall submit to the President annual estimates of the expenditures and appropriations necessary for the maintenance and operation of the survivors annuity fund, and such supplemental and deficiency estimates as may be required from time to time for the same purposes, according to law. The chief judge shall cause periodic examinations of the survivors annuity fund to be made by an actuary, who may be an actuary employed by another department of the Government temporarily assigned for the purpose, and whose findings and recommendations shall be transmitted by the chief judge to the Tax Court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(q) Transitional provision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a judge who dies within 6 months after the date of enactment of this section after having rendered at least 5 years of civilian service computed as prescribed in subsection (n), but without having made an election as provided in subsection (b), an annuity shall be paid to his surviving spouse and surviving dependents as is provided in this section, as if such judge had elected on the day of his death to bring himself within the purview of this section but had not made the deposit provided for by subsection (d). An annuity shall be payable under this section computed upon the basis of the actual length of service as a judge and other allowable service of the judge and subject to the reduction required by subsection (d) even though no deposit has been made, as required by subsection (h) with respect to any of such service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(r) Waiver of civil service benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any judge electing under subsection (b) shall, at the time of such election, waive all benefits under the civil service retirement laws. Such a waiver shall be made in the same manner and shall have the same force and effect as an election filed under section 7447(e).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(s) Increases attributable to increased pay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the salary of a judge under section 7443(c) is increased, each annuity payable from the survivors annuity fund which is based, in whole or in part, upon a deceased judge having rendered some portion of his or her final 18 months of service as a judge of the Tax Court, shall also be increased. The amount of the increase in such an annuity shall be determined by multiplying the amount of the annuity, on the date on which the increase in salary becomes effective, by 3 percent for each full 5 percent by which such salary has been increased.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(t) Authorization of appropriation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Funds necessary to carry out the provisions of this section may be appropriated out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated.</p>
