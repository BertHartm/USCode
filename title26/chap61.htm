<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6013. Joint returns of income tax by husband and wife</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Joint returns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A husband and wife may make a single return jointly of income taxes under subtitle A, even though one of the spouses has neither gross income nor deductions, except as provided below:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no joint return shall be made if either the husband or wife at any time during the taxable year is a nonresident alien;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) no joint return shall be made if the husband and wife have different taxable years; except that if such taxable years begin on the same day and end on different days because of the death of either or both, then the joint return may be made with respect to the taxable year of each. The above exception shall not apply if the surviving spouse remarries before the close of his taxable year, nor if the taxable year of either spouse is a fractional part of a year under section 443(a)(1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of death of one spouse or both spouses the joint return with respect to the decedent may be made only by his executor or administrator; except that in the case of the death of one spouse the joint return may be made by the surviving spouse with respect to both himself and the decedent if no return for the taxable year has been made by the decedent, no executor or administrator has been appointed, and no executor or administrator is appointed before the last day prescribed by law for filing the return of the surviving spouse. If an executor or administrator of the decedent is appointed after the making of the joint return by the surviving spouse, the executor or administrator may disaffirm such joint return by making, within 1 year after the last day prescribed by law for filing the return of the surviving spouse, a separate return for the taxable year of the decedent with respect to which the joint return was made, in which case the return made by the survivor shall constitute his separate return.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Joint return after filing separate return</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), if an individual has filed a separate return for a taxable year for which a joint return could have been made by him and his spouse under subsection (a) and the time prescribed by law for filing the return for such taxable year has expired, such individual and his spouse may nevertheless make a joint return for such taxable year. A joint return filed by the husband and wife under this subsection shall constitute the return of the husband and wife for such taxable year, and all payments, credits, refunds, or other repayments made or allowed with respect to the separate return of either spouse for such taxable year shall be taken into account in determining the extent to which the tax based upon the joint return has been paid. If a joint return is made under this subsection, any election (other than the election to file a separate return) made by either spouse in his separate return for such taxable year with respect to the treatment of any income, deduction, or credit of such spouse shall not be changed in the making of the joint return where such election would have been irrevocable if the joint return had not been made. If a joint return is made under this subsection after the death of either spouse, such return with respect to the decedent can be made only by his executor or administrator.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitations for making of election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The election provided for in paragraph (1) may not be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) after the expiration of 3 years from the last date prescribed by law for filing the return for such taxable year (determined without regard to any extension of time granted to either spouse); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) after there has been mailed to either spouse, with respect to such taxable year, a notice of deficiency under section 6212, if the spouse, as to such notice, files a petition with the Tax Court within the time prescribed in section 6213; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) after either spouse has commenced a suit in any court for the recovery of any part of the tax for such taxable year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) after either spouse has entered into a closing agreement under section 7121 with respect to such taxable year, or after any civil or criminal case arising against either spouse with respect to such taxable year has been compromised under section 7122.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) When return deemed filed</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Assessment and collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of section 6501 (relating to periods of limitations on assessment and collection), and for purposes of section 6651 (relating to delinquent returns), a joint return made under this subsection shall be deemed to have been filed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Where both spouses filed separate returns prior to making the joint return&mdash;on the date the last separate return was filed (but not earlier than the last date prescribed by law for filing the return of either spouse);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Where only one spouse filed a separate return prior to the making of the joint return, and the other spouse had less than the exemption amount of gross income for such taxable year&mdash;on the date of the filing of such separate return (but not earlier than the last date prescribed by law for the filing of such separate return); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Where only one spouse filed a separate return prior to the making of the joint return, and the other spouse had gross income of the exemption amount or more for such taxable year&mdash;on the date of the filing of such joint return.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;exemption amount&rdquo; has the meaning given to such term by section 151(d). For purposes of clauses (ii) and (iii), if the spouse whose gross income is being compared to the exemption amount is 65 or over, such clauses <!-- PDFPage:2656 -->shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;the sum of the exemption amount and the additional standard deduction under section 63(c)(2) by reason of section 63(f)(1)(A)&rdquo; for &ldquo;the exemption amount&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Credit or refund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of section 6511, a joint return made under this subsection shall be deemed to have been filed on the last date prescribed by law for filing the return for such taxable year (determined without regard to any extension of time granted to either spouse).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Additional time for assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a joint return is made under this subsection, the periods of limitations provided in sections 6501 and 6502 on the making of assessments and the beginning of levy or a proceeding in court for collection shall with respect to such return include one year immediately after the date of the filing of such joint return (computed without regard to the provisions of paragraph (3)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Additions to the tax and penalties</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Coordination with part II of subchapter A of chapter 68</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of part II of subchapter A of chapter 68, where the sum of the amounts shown as tax on the separate returns of each spouse is less than the amount shown as tax on the joint return made under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such sum shall be treated as the amount shown on the joint return,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any negligence (or disregard of rules or regulations) on either separate return shall be treated as negligence (or such disregard) on the joint return, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) any fraud on either separate return shall be treated as fraud on the joint return.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Criminal penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of section 7206(1) and (2) and section 7207 (relating to criminal penalties in the case of fraudulent returns) the term &ldquo;return&rdquo; includes a separate return filed by a spouse with respect to a taxable year for which a joint return is made under this subsection after the filing of such separate return.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Treatment of joint return after death of either spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of sections 15, 443, and 7851(a)(1)(A), where the husband and wife have different taxable years because of the death of either spouse, the joint return shall be treated as if the taxable years of both spouses ended on the date of the closing of the surviving spouse's taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the status as husband and wife of two individuals having taxable years beginning on the same day shall be determined&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if both have the same taxable year&mdash;as of the close of such year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if one dies before the close of the taxable year of the other&mdash;as of the time of such death;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an individual who is legally separated from his spouse under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance shall not be considered as married; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if a joint return is made, the tax shall be computed on the aggregate income and the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and several.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">[(e) Repealed. Pub. L. 105&ndash;206, title III, &sect;3201(e)(1), July 22, 1998, 112 Stat. 740]</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the spouse of such individual is otherwise entitled to file a joint return for any taxable year which begins on or before the day which is 2 years after the date designated under section 112 as the date of termination of combatant activities in such zone,</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-block">Any determination under this section shall be made without regard to community property laws.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:2662 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a joint return has been made for a taxable year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on such return there is an understatement of tax attributable to erroneous items of one individual filing the joint return;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the other individual filing the joint return establishes that in signing the return he or she did not know, and had no reason to know, that there was such understatement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) taking into account all the facts and circumstances, it is inequitable to hold the other individual liable for the deficiency in tax for such taxable year attributable to such understatement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the other individual elects (in such form as the Secretary may prescribe) the benefits of this subsection not later than the date which is 2 years after the date the Secretary has begun collection activities with respect to the individual making the election,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then the other individual shall be relieved of liability for tax (including interest, penalties, and other amounts) for such taxable year to the extent such liability is attributable to such understatement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Apportionment of relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an individual who, but for paragraph (1)(C), would be relieved of liability under paragraph (1), establishes that in signing the return such individual did not know, and had no reason to know, the extent of such understatement, then such individual shall be relieved of liability for tax (including interest, penalties, and other amounts) for such taxable year to the extent that such liability is attributable to the portion of such understatement of which such individual did not know and had no reason to know.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Understatement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;understatement&rdquo; has the meaning given to such term by section 6662(d)(2)(A).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Time for election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An election under this subsection for any taxable year may be made at any time after a deficiency for such year is asserted but not later than 2 years after the date on which the Secretary has begun collection activities with respect to the individual making the election.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Election not valid with respect to certain deficiencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary demonstrates that an individual making an election under this subsection had actual knowledge, at the time such individual signed the return, of any item giving rise to a deficiency (or portion thereof) which is not allocable to such individual under subsection (d), such election shall not apply to such deficiency (or portion). This subparagraph shall not apply where the individual with actual knowledge establishes that such individual signed the return under duress.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Liability increased by reason of transfers of property to avoid tax</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the portion of the deficiency for which the individual electing the application of this subsection is liable (without regard to this paragraph) shall be increased by the value of any disqualified asset transferred to the individual.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The term &ldquo;disqualified asset&rdquo; means any property or right to property transferred to an individual making the election under this subsection with respect to a joint return by the other individual filing such joint return if the principal purpose of the transfer was the avoidance of tax or payment of tax.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Presumption</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">For purposes of clause (i), except as provided in subclause (II), any transfer <!-- PDFPage:2663 -->which is made after the date which is 1 year before the date on which the first letter of proposed deficiency which allows the taxpayer an opportunity for administrative review in the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals is sent shall be presumed to have as its principal purpose the avoidance of tax or payment of tax.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">Subclause (I) shall not apply to any transfer pursuant to a decree of divorce or separate maintenance or a written instrument incident to such a decree or to any transfer which an individual establishes did not have as its principal purpose the avoidance of tax or payment of tax.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (c)&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The portion of any deficiency on a joint return allocated to an individual shall be the amount which bears the same ratio to such deficiency as the net amount of items taken into account in computing the deficiency and allocable to the individual under paragraph (3) bears to the net amount of all items taken into account in computing the deficiency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Separate treatment of certain items</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a deficiency (or portion thereof) is attributable to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the disallowance of a credit; or</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Allocation of items giving rise to the deficiency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in paragraphs (4) and (5), any item giving rise to a deficiency on a joint return shall be allocated to individuals filing the return in the same manner as it would have been allocated if the individuals had filed separate returns for the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception where other spouse benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Under rules prescribed by the Secretary, an item otherwise allocable to an individual under subparagraph (A) shall be allocated to the other individual filing the joint return to the extent the item gave rise to a tax benefit on the joint return to the other individual.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Exception for fraud</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may provide for an allocation of any item in a manner not prescribed by subparagraph (A) if the Secretary establishes that such allocation is appropriate due to fraud of one or both individuals.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Limitations on separate returns disregarded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an item of deduction or credit is disallowed in its entirety solely because a separate return is filed, such disallowance shall be disregarded and the item shall be computed as if a joint return had been filed and then allocated between the spouses appropriately. A similar rule shall apply for purposes of section 86.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Child's liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the liability of a child of a taxpayer is included on a joint return, such liability shall be disregarded in computing the separate liability of either spouse and such liability shall be allocated appropriately between the spouses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Petition for review by Tax Court</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Suspension of running of period of limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The running of the period of limitations in section 6502 on the collection of the assessment to which the petition under paragraph (1)(A) relates shall be suspended&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the Secretary may apply the rules of paragraph (3) with respect to such transaction (whether or not the Secretary begins a proceeding to enforce such summons). If the reporting corporation fails to maintain (or cause another to maintain) records as required by subsection (a), and by reason of that failure, the summons is quashed in a proceeding described in subparagraph (B) or the reporting corporation is not able to provide the records requested in the summons, the Secretary may apply the rules of paragraph (3) with respect to any transaction to which the records relate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Applicable rules in cases of noncompliance</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the cost to the reporting corporation of any property acquired in such transaction from the related party (or transferred by such corporation in such transaction to the related party),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall be the amount determined by the Secretary in the Secretary's sole discretion from the Secretary's own knowledge or from such information as the Secretary may obtain through testimony or otherwise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Judicial proceedings</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Proceedings to quash</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any law or rule of law, any reporting corporation to which the Sec<!-- PDFPage:2686 -->retary issues a summons referred to in paragraph (2)(A) shall have the right to begin a proceeding to quash such summons not later than the 90th day after such summons was issued. In any such proceeding, the Secretary may seek to compel compliance with such summons.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Review of secretarial determination of noncompliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any law or rule of law, any reporting corporation which has been notified by the Secretary that the Secretary has determined that such corporation has not substantially complied with a summons referred to in paragraph (2) shall have the right to begin a proceeding to review such determination not later than the 90th day after the day on which the notice referred to in paragraph (2)(C) was mailed. If such a proceeding is not begun on or before such 90th day, such determination by the Secretary shall be binding and shall not be reviewed by any court.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The United States district court for the district in which the person (to whom the summons is issued) resides or is found shall have jurisdiction to hear any proceeding brought under subparagraph (A) or (B). Any order or other determination in such a proceeding shall be treated as a final order which may be appealed.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Suspension of statute of limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the reporting corporation brings an action under subparagraph (A) or (B), the running of any period of limitations under section 6501 (relating to assessment and collection of tax) or under section 6531 (relating to criminal prosecutions) with respect to any affected taxable year shall be suspended for the period during which such proceeding, and appeals therein, are pending. In no event shall any such period expire before the 90th day after the day on which there is a final determination in such proceeding. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;affected taxable year&rdquo; means any taxable year if the determination of the amount of tax imposed for such taxable year is affected by the treatment of the transaction to which the summons relates.</p>

The burden of proof with respect to the issue of disclosure of any information shall be on the Secretary and any other person seeking to restrain disclosure.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Intervention</h4>

The Secretary shall send such notice by registered or certified mail to the last known address of such person. Any person to whom such determination or background file document pertains may intervene in the proceeding (anonymously, if appropriate).
