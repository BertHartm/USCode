<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) such benefits do not discriminate in favor of employees who are highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)).

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) merely because the benefits under the plan which are first determined in a nondiscriminatory manner within the meaning of subparagraph (A) are then reduced by any sick, accident, or unemployment compensation benefits received under State or Federal law (or reduced by a portion of such benefits if determined in a nondiscriminatory manner), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) merely because the plan provides only for employees who are not eligible to receive sick, accident, or unemployment compensation benefits under State or Federal law the same benefits (or a portion of such benefits if determined in a nondiscriminatory manner) which such employees would receive under such laws if such employees were eligible for such benefits, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) merely because the plan provides only for employees who are not eligible under another plan (which meets the requirements of subparagraph (A)) of supplemental unemployment compensation benefits provided wholly by the employer the same benefits (or a portion of such benefits if determined <!-- PDFPage:1119 -->in a nondiscriminatory manner) which such employees would receive under such other plan if such employees were eligible under such other plan, but only if the employees eligible under both plans would make a classification which would be nondiscriminatory within the meaning of subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A plan shall be considered to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) during the whole of any year of the plan if on one day in each quarter it satisfies such requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The term &ldquo;supplemental unemployment compensation benefits&rdquo; means only&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) benefits which are paid to an employee because of his involuntary separation from the employment of the employer (whether or not such separation is temporary) resulting directly from a reduction in force, the discontinuance of a plant or operation, or other similar conditions, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) sick and accident benefits subordinate to the benefits described in clause (i).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Exemption shall not be denied under subsection (a) to any organization entitled to such exemption as an association described in paragraph (9) of this subsection merely because such organization provides for the payment of supplemental unemployment benefits (as defined in subparagraph (D)(i)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(18) A trust or trusts created before June 25, 1959, forming part of a plan providing for the payment of benefits under a pension plan funded only by contributions of employees, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) under the plan, it is impossible, at any time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to employees under the plan, for any part of the corpus or income to be (within the taxable year or thereafter) used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than the providing of benefits under the plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such benefits are payable to employees under a classification which is set forth in the plan and which is found by the Secretary not to be discriminatory in favor of employees who are highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such benefits do not discriminate in favor of employees who are highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)). A plan shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of this subparagraph merely because the benefits received under the plan bear a uniform relationship to the total compensation, or the basic or regular rate of compensation, of the employees covered by the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in the case of a plan under which an employee may designate certain contributions as deductible&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such contributions do not exceed the amount with respect to which a deduction is allowable under section 219(b)(3),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) requirements similar to the requirements of section 401(k)(3)(A)(ii) are met with respect to such elective contributions,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) such contributions are treated as elective deferrals for purposes of section 402(g) (other than paragraph (4) thereof), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the requirements of section 401(a)(30) are met.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (D)(ii), rules similar to the rules of section 401(k)(8) shall apply. For purposes of section 4979, any excess contribution under clause (ii) shall be treated as an excess contribution under a cash or deferred arrangement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(19) A post or organization of past or present members of the Armed Forces of the United States, or an auxiliary unit or society of, or a trust or foundation for, any such post or organization&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) organized in the United States or any of its possessions,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) at least 75 percent of the members of which are past or present members of the Armed Forces of the United States and substantially all of the other members of which are individuals who are cadets or are spouses, widows, or widowers of past or present members of the Armed Forces of the United States or of cadets, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(20) an&nbsp;<sup><a href="#501_3_target" name="501_3">3</a></sup> organization or trust created or organized in the United States, the exclusive function of which is to form part of a qualified group legal services plan or plans, within the meaning of section 120. An organization or trust which receives contributions because of section 120(c)(5)(C) shall not be prevented from qualifying as an organization described in this paragraph merely because it provides legal services or indemnification against the cost of legal services unassociated with a qualified group legal services plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(21)(A) A trust or trusts established in writing, created or organized in the United States, and contributed to by any person (except an insurance company) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the purpose of such trust or trusts is exclusively&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) to pay administrative and other incidental expenses of such trust in connection with the operation of the trust and the processing of claims against such person under Black Lung Acts, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) to pay accident or health benefits for retired miners and their spouses and dependents (including administrative and other incidental expenses of such trust in connection therewith) or premiums for insurance exclusively covering such benefits; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) no part of the assets of the trust may be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) on the market, either (i) at the price of the obligation prevailing on a national securities exchange which is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or (ii) if the obligation is not traded on such a national securities exchange, at a price not less favorable to the trust than the offering price for the obligation as established by current bid and asked prices quoted by persons independent of the issuer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) from an underwriter, at a price (i) not in excess of the public offering price for the obligation as set forth in a prospectus or offering circular filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and (ii) at which a substantial portion of the same issue is acquired by persons independent of the issuer; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) directly from the issuer, at a price not less favorable to the trust than the price paid currently for a substantial portion of the same issue by persons independent of the issuer;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) immediately following acquisition of such obligation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) not more than 25 percent of the aggregate amount of obligations issued in such issue and outstanding at the time of acquisition is held by the trust, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) at least 50 percent of the aggregate amount referred to in subparagraph (A) is held by persons independent of the issuer; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (b)(1) shall not apply to a loan made by a trust described in section 401(a) to the employer (or to a renewal of such a loan or, if the loan is repayable upon demand, to a continuation of such a loan) if the loan bears a reasonable rate of interest, and if (in the case of a making or renewal)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the employer is prohibited (at the time of such making or renewal) by any law of the United States or regulation thereunder from directly or indirectly pledging, as security for such a loan, a particular class or classes of his assets the value of which (at such time) represents more than one-half of the value of all his assets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the making or renewal, as the case may be, is approved in writing as an investment which is consistent with the exempt purposes of the trust by a trustee who is independent of the employer, and no other such trustee had previously refused to give such written approval; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) immediately following the making or renewal, as the case may be, the aggregate amount loaned by the trust to the employer, without the receipt of adequate security, does not exceed 25 percent of the value of all the assets of the trust.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such organization notifies the Secretary (at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe) of its intent to accomplish such termination, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) with respect to such organization, there have been either willful repeated acts (or failures to act), or a willful and flagrant act (or failure to act), giving rise to liability for tax under chapter 42, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary notifies such organization that, by reason of subparagraph (A), such organization is liable for the tax imposed by subsection (c),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">and either such organization pays the tax imposed by subsection (c) (or any portion not abated under subsection (g)) or the entire amount of such tax is abated under subsection (g).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Transfer to, or operation as, public charity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The status as a private foundation of any organization, with respect to which there have not been either willful repeated acts (or failures to act) or a willful and flagrant act (or failure to act) giving rise to liability for tax under chapter 42, shall be terminated if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such organization distributes all of its net assets to one or more organizations described in section 170(b)(1)(A) (other than in clauses (vii) and (viii)) each of which has been in existence and so described for a continuous period of at least 60 calendar months immediately preceding such distribution, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) such organization meets the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of section 509(a) by the end of the 12-month period beginning with its first taxable year which begins after December 31, 1969, or for a continuous period of 60 calendar months beginning with the first day of any taxable year which begins after December 31, 1969,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such organization notifies the Secretary (in such manner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe) before the commencement of such 12-month or 60-month period (or before the 90th day after the day on which regulations first prescribed under this subsection become final) that it is terminating its private foundation status, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) such organization establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary (in such manner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe) immediately after the expiration of such 12-month or 60-month period that such organization has complied with clause (i).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If an organization gives notice under subparagraph (B)(ii) of the commencement of a 60-month period and such organization fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of section 509(a) for the entire 60-month period, this part and chapter 42 shall not apply to such organization for any taxable year within such 60-month period for which it does meet such requirements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Transferee foundations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this part, in the case of a transfer of assets of any private foundation to another private foundation pursuant to any liquidation, merger, redemption, recapitalization, or other adjustment, organization, or reorganization, the transferee foundation shall not be treated as a newly created organization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Imposition of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby imposed on each organization which is referred to in subsection (a) a tax equal to the lower of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the value of the net assets of such foundation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Aggregate tax benefit</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (c), the aggregate tax benefit resulting from the section 501(c)(3) status of any private foundation is the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the aggregate increases in tax under chapters 1, 11, and 12 (or the corresponding provisions of prior law) which would have been imposed with respect to all substantial contributors to the foundation if deductions for all contributions made by such contributors to the foundation after February 28, 1913, had been disallowed, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the aggregate increases in tax under chapter 1 (or the corresponding provisions of prior law) which would have been imposed with respect to the income of the private foundation for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1912, if (i) it had not been exempt from tax under section 501(a) (or the corresponding provisions of prior law), and (ii) in the case of a trust, deductions under section 642(c) (or the corresponding provisions of prior law) had been limited to 20 percent of the taxable income of the trust (computed without the benefit of section 642(c) but with the benefit of section 170(b)(1)(A)), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) interest on the increases in tax determined under subparagraphs (A) and (B) from the first date on which each such increase would have been due and payable to the date on which the organization ceases to be a private foundation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Substantial contributor</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;substantial contributor&rdquo; means any person who contributed or bequeathed an aggregate amount of more than $5,000 to the private foundation, if such amount is more than 2 percent of the total contributions and be<!-- PDFPage:1139 -->quests received by the foundation before the close of the taxable year of the foundation in which the contribution or bequest is received by the foundation from such person. In the case of a trust, the term &ldquo;substantial contributor&rdquo; also means the creator of the trust.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) each contribution or bequest shall be valued at fair market value on the date it was received,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a foundation which is in existence on October 9, 1969, all contributions and bequests received on or before such date shall be treated (except for purposes of clause (i)) as if received on such date,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) an individual shall be treated as making all contributions and bequests made by his spouse, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) any person who is a substantial contributor on any date shall remain a substantial contributor for all subsequent periods.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Person ceases to be substantial contributor in certain cases</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A person shall cease to be treated as a substantial contributor with respect to any private foundation as of the close of any taxable year of such foundation if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) during the 10-year period ending at the close of such taxable year such person (and all related persons) have not made any contribution to such private foundation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) at no time during such 10-year period was such person (or any related person) a foundation manager of such private foundation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the aggregate contributions made by such person (and related persons) are determined by the Secretary to be insignificant when compared to the aggregate amount of contributions to such foundation by one other person.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;For purposes of subclause (III), appreciation on contributions while held by the foundation shall be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Related person</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), the term &ldquo;related person&rdquo; means, with respect to any person, any other person who would be a disqualified person (within the meaning of section 4946) by reason of his relationship to such person. In the case of a contributor which is a corporation, the term also includes any officer or director of such corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the determination as to whether and to what extent there would have been any increase in tax shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Value of assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (c), the value of the net assets shall be determined at whichever time such value is higher: (1) the first day on which action is taken by the organization which culminates in its ceasing to be a private foundation, or (2) the date on which it ceases to be a private foundation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Liability in case of transfers of assets from private foundation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining liability for the tax imposed by subsection (c) in the case of assets transferred by the private foundation, such tax shall be deemed to have been imposed on the first day on which action is taken by the organization which culminates in its ceasing to be a private foundation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Abatement of taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may abate the unpaid portion of the assessment of any tax imposed by subsection (c), or any liability in respect thereof, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the private foundation distributes all of its net assets to one or more organizations described in section 170(b)(1)(A) (other than in clauses (vii) and (viii)) each of which has been in existence and so described for a continuous period of at least 60 calendar months, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) following the notification prescribed in section 6104(c) to the appropriate State officer, such State officer within one year notifies the Secretary, in such manner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe, that corrective action has been initiated pursuant to State law to insure that the assets of such private foundation are preserved for such charitable or other purposes specified in section 501(c)(3) as may be ordered or approved by a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon completion of the corrective action, the Secretary receives certification from the appropriate State officer that such action has resulted in such preservation of assets.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this title&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the term &ldquo;unrelated business taxable income&rdquo; means the gross income derived by any organization from any unrelated trade or business (as defined in section 513) regularly carried on by it, less the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the carrying on of such trade or business, both computed with the modifications provided in subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule for foreign organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an organization described in section 511 which is a foreign organization, the unrelated business taxable income shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) its unrelated business taxable income which is derived from sources within the United States and which is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) its unrelated business taxable income which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rules applicable to organizations described in paragraph (7), (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c)</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an organization described in paragraph (7), (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c), the term &ldquo;unrelated business taxable income&rdquo; means the gross income (excluding any exempt function income), less the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the production of the gross income (excluding exempt function income), both computed with the modifications provided in paragraphs (6), (10), (11), and (12) of subsection (b). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the deductions provided by sections 243, 244, and 245 (relating to dividends received by corporations) shall be treated as not directly connected with the production of gross income.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exempt function income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;exempt function income&rdquo; means the gross income from dues, fees, charges, or similar amounts paid by members of the organization as consideration for providing such members or their dependents or guests goods, facilities, or services in furtherance <!-- PDFPage:1145 -->of the purposes constituting the basis for the exemption of the organization to which such income is paid. Such term also means all income (other than an amount equal to the gross income derived from any unrelated trade or business regularly carried on by such organization computed as if the organization were subject to paragraph (1)), which is set aside&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for a purpose specified in section 170(c)(4), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of an organization described in paragraph (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c), to provide for the payment of life, sick, accident, or other benefits,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">including reasonable costs of administration directly connected with a purpose described in clause (i) or (ii). If during the taxable year, an amount which is attributable to income so set aside is used for a purpose other than that described in clause (i) or (ii), such amount shall be included, under subparagraph (A), in unrelated business taxable income for the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Applicability to certain corporations described in section 501(c)(2)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a corporation described in section 501(c)(2), the income of which is payable to an organization described in paragraph (7), (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c), subparagraph (A) shall apply as if such corporation were the organization to which the income is payable. For purposes of the preceding sentence, such corporation shall be treated as having exempt function income for a taxable year only if it files a consolidated return with such organization for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Nonrecognition of gain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If property used directly in the performance of the exempt function of an organization described in paragraph (7), (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c) is sold by such organization, and within a period beginning 1 year before the date of such sale, and ending 3 years after such date, other property is purchased and used by such organization directly in the performance of its exempt function, gain (if any) from such sale shall be recognized only to the extent that such organization's sales price of the old property exceeds the organization's cost of purchasing the other property. For purposes of this subparagraph, the destruction in whole or in part, theft, seizure, requisition, or condemnation of property, shall be treated as the sale of such property, and rules similar to the rules provided by subsections (b), (c), (e), and (j) of section 1034 (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997) shall apply.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Limitation on amount of setaside in the case of organizations described in paragraph (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c)</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of any organization described in paragraph (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c), a set-aside for any purpose specified in clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) may be taken into account under subparagraph (B) only to the extent that such set-aside does not result in an amount of assets set aside for such purpose in excess of the account limit determined under section 419A (without regard to subsection (f)(6) thereof) for the taxable year (not taking into account any reserve described in section 419A(c)(2)(A) for post-retirement medical benefits).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Treatment of existing reserves for post-retirement medical or life insurance benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) Clause (i) shall not apply to any income attributable to an existing reserve for post-retirement medical or life insurance benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) For purposes of subclause (I), the term &ldquo;reserve for post-retirement medical or life insurance benefits&rdquo; means the greater of the amount of assets set aside for purposes of post-retirement medical or life insurance benefits to be provided to covered employees as of the close of the last plan year ending before the date of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 or on July 18, 1984.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) All payments during plan years ending on or after the date of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 of post-retirement medical benefits or life insurance benefits shall be charged against the reserve referred to in subclause (II). Except to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, all plans of an employer shall be treated as 1 plan for purposes of the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Treatment of tax exempt organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">This subparagraph shall not apply to any organization if substantially all of the contributions to such organization are made by employers who were exempt from tax under this chapter throughout the 5-taxable year period ending with the taxable year in which the contributions are made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule applicable to organizations described in section 501(c)(19)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an organization described in section 501(c)(19), the term &ldquo;unrelated business taxable income&rdquo; does not include any amount attributable to payments for life, sick, accident, or health insurance with respect to members of such organizations or their dependents which is set aside for the purpose of providing for the payment of insurance benefits or for a purpose specified in section 170(c)(4). If an amount set aside under the preceding sentence is used during the taxable year for a purpose other than a purpose described in the preceding sentence, such amount shall be included, under paragraph (1), in unrelated business taxable income for the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Definition of payments with respect to securities loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The term &ldquo;payments with respect to securities loans&rdquo; includes all amounts re<!-- PDFPage:1146 -->ceived in respect of a security (as defined in section 1236(c)) transferred by the owner to another person in a transaction to which section 1058 applies (whether or not title to the security remains in the name of the lender) including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) amounts in respect of dividends, interest, or other distributions,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) fees computed by reference to the period beginning with the transfer of securities by the owner and ending with the transfer of identical securities back to the transferor by the transferee and the fair market value of the security during such period,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) income from collateral security for such loan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) income from the investment of collateral security.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Subparagraph (A) shall apply only with respect to securities transferred pursuant to an agreement between the transferor and the transferee which provides for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) reasonable procedures to implement the obligation of the transferee to furnish to the transferor, for each business day during such period, collateral with a fair market value not less than the fair market value of the security at the close of business on the preceding business day,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) termination of the loan by the transferor upon notice of not more than 5 business days, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) return to the transferor of securities identical to the transferred securities upon termination of the loan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an organization acquires real property for the principal purpose of using the land (commencing within 10 years of the time of acquisition) in the manner described in paragraph (1)(A) and at the time of acquisition the property is in the neighborhood of other property owned by the organization which is used in such manner, the real property acquired for such future use shall not be treated as debt-financed property so long as the organization does not abandon its intent to so use the land within the 10-year period. The preceding sentence shall not apply for any period after the expiration of the 10-year period, and shall apply after the first 5 years of the 10-year period only if the organization establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it is reasonably certain that the land will be used in the described manner before the expiration of the 10-year period.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Other cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the first sentence of subparagraph (A) is inapplicable only because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the acquired land is not in the neighborhood referred to in subparagraph (A), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the organization (for the period after the first 5 years of the 10-year period) is unable to establish to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it is reasonably certain that the land will be used in the manner described inparagraph (1)(A) before the expiration of the 10-year period,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">but the land is converted to such use by the organization within the 10-year period, the real property (subject to the provisions of subparagraph (D)) shall not be treated as debt-financed property for any period before such conversion. For purposes of this subparagraph, land shall not be treated as used in the manner described in paragraph (1)(A) by reason of the use made of any structure which was on the land when acquired by the organization.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraphs (A) and (B)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall apply with respect to any structure on the land when acquired by the organization, or to the land occupied by the structure, only if (and so long as) the intended future use of the land in the manner described in paragraph (1)(A) requires that the structure be demolished or removed in order to use the land in such manner;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall not apply to structures erected on the land after the acquisition of the land; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) shall not apply to property subject to a lease which is a business lease (as defined in this section immediately before the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1976).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Refund of taxes when subparagraph (B) applies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an organization for any taxable year has not used land in the manner to satisfy the actual use condition of subparagraph (B) before the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for such taxable year, the tax for such year shall be computed without regard to the application of subparagraph (B), but if and when such use condition is satisfied, the provisions of subparagraph (B) shall then be applied to such taxable year. If the actual use condition of subparagraph (B) is satisfied for any taxable year after such time for filing the return, and if credit or refund of any overpayment for the taxable year resulting from the satisfaction of such use condition is prevented at the close of the taxable year in which the use condition is satisfied, by the operation of any law or rule of law (other than chapter 74, relating to closing agreements and compromises), credit or refund of such overpayment may nevertheless be allowed or made if claim therefor is filed before the expiration of 1 year after the close of the taxable year in which the use condition is satisfied.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Special rule for churches</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In applying this paragraph to a church or convention or association of churches, in lieu of the 10-year period referred to in subparagraphs (A) and (B) a 15-year period shall be applied, and subparagraphs (A) and (B)(ii) shall apply whether or not the acquired land meets the neighborhood test.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Where property subject to a mortgage is acquired by an organization by bequest or devise, the indebtedness secured by the mortgage shall not be treated as acquisition indebtedness during a period of 10 years following the date of the acquisition. If an organization acquires property by gift subject to a mortgage which was placed on the property more than 5 years before the gift, which property was held by the donor more than 5 years before the gift, the indebtedness secured by such mortgage shall not be treated as acquisition indebtedness during a period of 10 years following the date of such gift.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Extension of obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, an extension, renewal, or refinancing of an obligation evidencing a pre-existing indebtedness shall not be treated as the creation of a new indebtedness.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) does not guarantee a minimum amount of payments or specify a maximum amount of payments, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) does not provide for any adjustment of the amount of the annuity payments by reference to the income received from the transferred property or any other property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Certain Federal financing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;acquisition indebtedness&rdquo; does not include an obligation, to the extent that it is insured by the Federal Housing Administration, to finance the purchase, rehabilitation, or construction of housing for low and moderate income persons.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Average acquisition indebtedness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;average acquisition indebtedness&rdquo; for any taxable year with respect to a debt-financed property means the average amount, determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the acquisition indebtedness during the period the property is held by the organization during the taxable year, except that for the purpose of computing the percentage of any gain or loss to be taken into account on a sale or other disposition of debt-financed property, such term means the highest amount of the acquisition indebtedness with respect to such property during the 12-month period ending with the date of the sale or other disposition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the term &ldquo;acquisition indebtedness&rdquo; does not, for purposes of this section, include indebtedness incurred by a qualified organization in acquiring or improving any real property. For purposes of this paragraph, an interest in a mortgage shall in no event be treated as real property.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1159 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exceptions</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Organizations having capital stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Exemption shall not be denied any such association because it has capital stock, if the dividend rate of such stock is fixed at not to exceed the legal rate of interest in the State of incorporation or 8 percent per annum, whichever is greater, on the value of the consideration for which the stock was issued, and if substantially all such stock (other than nonvoting preferred stock, the owners of which are not entitled or permitted to participate, directly or indirectly, in the profits of the association, upon dissolution or otherwise, beyond the fixed dividends) is owned by producers who market their products or purchase their supplies and equipment through the association.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Organizations maintaining reserve</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Exemption shall not be denied any such association because there is accumulated and maintained by it a reserve required by State law or a reasonable reserve for any necessary purpose.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Transactions with nonmembers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Exemption shall not be denied any such association which markets the products of nonmembers in an amount the value of which does not exceed the value of the products marketed for members, or which purchases supplies and equipment for nonmembers in an amount the value of which does not exceed the value of the supplies and equipment purchased for members, provided the value of the purchases made for persons who are neither members nor producers does not exceed 15 percent of the value of all its purchases.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Business for the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Business done for the United States or any of its agencies shall be disregarded in determining the right to exemption under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Netting of losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Exemption shall not be denied any such association because such association computes its net earnings for purposes of determining any amount available for distribution to patrons in the manner described in paragraph (1) of section 1388(j).</p>
