<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) The eligible candidates of a minor party in a presidential election shall be entitled to payments under section 9006 equal in the aggregate to an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount allowed under paragraph (1) for a major party as the number of popular votes received by the candidate for President of the minor party, as such candidate, in the preceding presidential election bears to the average number of popular votes received by the candidates for President of the major parties in the preceding presidential election.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the candidate of one or more political parties (not including a major party) for the office of President was a candidate for such office in the preceding presidential election and received 5 percent or more but less than 25 percent of the total number of popular votes received by all candidates for such office, such candidate and his running mate for the office of Vice President, upon compliance with the provisions of section 9003(a) and (c), shall be treated as eligible candidates entitled to payments under section 9006 in an amount computed as provided in subparagraph (A) by taking into account all the popular votes received by such candidate for the office of President in the preceding presidential election. If eligible candidates of a minor party are entitled to payments under this subparagraph, such entitlement shall be reduced by the amount of the entitlement allowed under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The eligible candidates of a minor party or a new party in a presidential election whose candidate for President in such election receives, as such candidate, 5 percent or more of the total number of popular votes cast for the office of President in such election shall be entitled to payments under section 9006 equal in the aggregate to an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount allowed under paragraph (1) for a major party as the number of popular votes received by such candidate in such election bears to the average number of popular votes received in such election by the candidates for President of the major parties. In the case of eligible candidates entitled to payments under paragraph (2), the amount allowable under this paragraph shall be limited <!-- PDFPage:3159 -->to the amount, if any, by which the entitlement under the preceding sentence exceeds the amount of the entitlement under paragraph (2).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Expenditures from personal funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to be eligible to receive any payment under section 9006, the candidate of a major, minor, or new party in an election for the office of President shall certify to the Commission, under penalty of perjury, that such candidate will not knowingly make expenditures from his personal funds, or the personal funds of his immediate family, in connection with his campaign for election to the office of President in excess of, in the aggregate, $50,000. For purposes of this subsection, expenditures from personal funds made by a candidate of a major, minor, or new party for the office of Vice President shall be considered to be expenditures by the candidate of such party for the office of President.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment of accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall maintain in the fund, in addition to any account which he maintains under section 9006(a), a separate account for the national committee of each major party and minor party. The Secretary shall deposit in each such account an amount equal to the amount which each such committee may receive under subsection (b). Such deposits shall be drawn from amounts designated by individuals under section 6096 and shall be made before any transfer is made to any account for any eligible candidate under section 9006(a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Entitlement to payments from the fund</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Major parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the provisions of this section, the national committee of a major party shall be entitled to payments under paragraph (3), with respect to any presidential nominating convention, in amounts which, in the aggregate, shall not exceed $4,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Minor parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the provisions of this section, the national committee of a minor party shall be entitled to payments under paragraph (3), with respect to any presidential nominating convention, in amounts which, in the aggregate, shall not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount the national committee of a major party is entitled to receive under paragraph (1) as the number of popular votes received by the candidate for President of the minor party, as such candidate, in the preceding presidential election bears to the average number of popular votes received by the candidates for President of the United States of the major parties in the preceding presidential election.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon receipt of certification from the Commission under subsection (g), the Secretary shall make payments from the appropriate account maintained under subsection (a) to the national committee of a major party or minor party which elects to receive its entitlement under this subsection. Such payments shall be available for use by such committee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Payments to the national committee of a major party or minor party under this subsection, from the account designated for such committee shall be limited to the amounts in such account at the time of payment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Adjustment of entitlements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The entitlements established by this subsection shall be adjusted in the same manner as expenditure limitations established by section 315(b) and section 315(d) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 are adjusted pursuant to the provisions of section 315(c) of such Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No part of any payment made under subsection (b) shall be used to defray the expenses of any candidate or delegate who is participating in any presidential nominating convention. Such payments shall be used only&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to repay loans the proceeds of which were used to defray such expenses, or otherwise to restore funds (other than contributions to defray such expenses received by such committee) used to defray such expenses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation of expenditures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Major parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided by paragraph (3), the national committee of a major party may not make expenditures with respect to a presidential nominating convention which, in the aggregate, exceed the amount of payments to which such committee is entitled under subsection (b)(1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Minor parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided by paragraph (3), the national committee of a minor party may not make expenditures with respect to a presidential nominating convention which, in the aggregate, exceed the amount of the entitlement of the national committee of a major party under subsection (b)(1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission may authorize the national committee of a major party or minor party to make expenditures which, in the aggregate, exceed the limitation established by paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) of this subsection. Such authorization shall be based upon a determination by the Commission that, due to extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances, such expenditures are necessary to assure the effective operation of the presidential nominating convention by such committee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Provision of legal or accounting services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the payment, by any person other than the national committee of a political party (unless the person paying for such services is a person other than the regular employer of the individual rendering such services) of compensation to any individual for legal or accounting services rendered to or on behalf of the national committee of a political party shall not be treated as an expenditure made by or on behalf of such committee with respect to its limitations on presidential nominating convention expenses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Availability of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The national committee of a major party or minor party may receive payments under subsection (b)(3) beginning on July 1 of the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which a presidential nominating convention of the political party involved is held.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transfer to the fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, after the close of a presidential nominating convention and after the national committee of <!-- PDFPage:3163 -->the political party involved has been paid the amount which it is entitled to receive under this section, there are moneys remaining in the account of such national committee, the Secretary shall transfer the moneys so remaining to the fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Certification by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any major party or minor party may file a statement with the Commission in such form and manner and at such times as it may require, designating the national committee of such party. Such statement shall include the information required by section 303(b) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, together with such additional information as the Commission may require. Upon receipt of a statement filed under the preceding sentences, the Commission promptly shall verify such statement according to such procedures and criteria as it may establish and shall certify to the Secretary for payment in full to any such committee of amounts to which such committee may be entitled under subsection (b). Such certifications shall be subject to an examination and audit which the Commission shall conduct no later than December 31, of the calendar year in which the presidential nominating convention involved is held.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Repayments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall have the same authority to require repayments from the national committee of a major party or a minor party as it has with respect to repayments from any eligible candidate under section 9007(b). The provisions of section 9007(c) and section 9007(d) shall apply with respect to any repayment required by the Commission under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall, as soon as practicable after each presidential election, submit a full report to the Senate and House of Representatives setting forth&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the qualified campaign expenses (shown in such detail as the Commission determines necessary) incurred by the candidates of each political party and their authorized committees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amounts certified by it under section 9005 for payment to the eligible candidates of each political party;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the amount of payments, if any, required from such committees under section 9008(h), and the reasons for each such payment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Each report submitted pursuant to this section shall be printed as a Senate document.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regulations, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission is authorized to prescribe such rules and regulations in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c), to conduct such examinations and audits (in addition to the examinations and audits required by section 9007(a)), to conduct such investigations, and to require the keeping and submission of such books, records, and information, as it deems necessary to carry out the functions and duties imposed on it by this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Review of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission, before prescribing any rule or regulation under subsection (b), shall transmit a statement with respect to such rule or regulation to the Senate and to the House of Representatives, in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. Such statement shall set forth the proposed rule or regulation and shall contain a detailed explanation and justification of such rule or regulation.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3164 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) If either such House does not, through appropriate action, disapprove the proposed rule or regulation set forth in such statement no later than 30 legislative days after receipt of such statement, then the Commission may prescribe such rule or regulation. Whenever a committee of the House of Representatives reports any resolution relating to any such rule or regulation, it is at any time thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) to move to proceed to the consideration of the resolution. The motion is highly privileged and is not debatable. An amendment to the motion is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to. The Commission may not prescribe any rule or regulation which is disapproved by either such House under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;legislative days&rdquo; does not include any calendar day on which both Houses of the Congress are not in session.</p>
