<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Adjustments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount so returned (excluding interest) shall be deemed to reduce the sum of the premiums paid under the contract during such year, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) waiver of premium.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Premium payments not disqualifying contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The payment of a premium which would result in the sum of the premiums paid exceeding the guideline premium limitation shall be disregarded for purposes of paragraph (1)(A)(i) if the amount of such premium does not exceed the amount necessary to prevent the termination of the contract without cash value on or before the end of the contract year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Net single premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In computing the net single premium under paragraph (1)(B)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the mortality basis shall be that guaranteed under the contract (determined by reference to the most recent mortality table allowed under all State laws on the date of issuance),</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation on temporary period for pooled financings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (B) shall not apply to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">There shall be allowed as a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a reasonable allowance for salaries or other compensation for personal services actually rendered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) traveling expenses (including amounts expended for meals and lodging other than amounts which are lavish or extravagant under the circumstances) while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) rentals or other payments required to be made as a condition to the continued use or possession, for purposes of the trade or business, of property to which the taxpayer has not taken or is not taking title or in which he has no equity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the place of residence of a Member of Congress (including any Delegate and Resident Commissioner) within the State, congressional district, or possession which he represents in Congress shall be considered his home, but amounts expended by such Members within each taxable year for living expenses shall not be deductible for income tax purposes in excess of $3,000. For purposes of paragraph (2), the taxpayer shall not be treated as being temporarily away from home during any period of employment if such period exceeds 1 year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Charitable contributions and gifts excepted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) for any contribution or gift which would be allowable as a deduction under section 170 were it not for the percentage limitations, the dollar limitations, or the requirements as to the time of payment, set forth in such section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Illegal bribes, kickbacks, and other payments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Illegal payments to government officials or employees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) for any payment made, directly or indirectly, to an official or employee of any government, or of any agency or instrumentality of any government, if the payment constitutes an illegal bribe or kickback or, if the payment is to an official or employee of a foreign government, the payment is unlawful under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. The burden of proof in respect of the issue, for the purposes of this paragraph, as to whether a payment constitutes an illegal bribe or kickback (or is unlawful under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977) shall be upon the Secretary to the same extent as he bears the burden of proof under section 7454 (concerning the burden of proof when the issue relates to fraud).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other illegal payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) for any payment (other than a payment described in paragraph (1)) made, directly or indirectly, to any person, if the payment constitutes an illegal bribe, illegal kickback, or other illegal payment under any law of the United States, or under any law of a State (but only if such State law is generally enforced), which subjects the payor to a criminal penalty or the loss of license or privilege to engage in a trade or business. For purposes of this paragraph, a kickback includes a payment in consideration of the referral of a client, patient, or customer.

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any bond, as defined in subsection (d), the following rules shall apply to the amortizable bond premium (determined under subsection (b)) on the bond:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Taxable bonds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a bond (other than a bond the interest on which is excludable from gross income), the amount of the amortizable bond premium for the taxable year shall be allowed as a deduction.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Cross reference</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>For adjustment to basis on account of amortizable bond premium, see section 1016(a)(5).</strong></p>
<!-- PDFPage:519 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amortizable bond premium</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amount of bond premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (2), the amount of bond premium, in the case of the holder of any bond, shall be determined&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) with reference to the amount of the basis (for determining loss on sale or exchange) of such bond,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) with reference to the amount payable on maturity or on earlier call date, in the case of any bond other than a bond to which clause (ii) applies, or and&nbsp;<sup><a href="#171_1_target" name="171_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) with reference to the amount payable on maturity (or if it results in a smaller amortizable bond premium attributable to the period to earlier call date, with reference to the amount payable on earlier call date), in the case of any bond described in subsection (a)(1) which is acquired after December 31, 1957, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) with adjustments proper to reflect unamortized bond premium, with respect to the bond, for the period before the date as of which subsection (a) becomes applicable with respect to the taxpayer with respect to such bond.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In no case shall the amount of bond premium on a convertible bond include any amount attributable to the conversion features of the bond.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount amortizable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amortizable bond premium of the taxable year shall be the amount of the bond premium attributable to such year. In the case of a bond to which paragraph (1)(B)(ii) applies and which has a call date, the amount of bond premium attributable to the taxable year in which the bond is called shall include an amount equal to the excess of the amount of the adjusted basis (for determining loss on sale or exchange) of such bond as of the beginning of the taxable year over the amount received on redemption of the bond or (if greater) the amount payable on maturity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Method of determination</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the determinations required under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be made on the basis of the taxpayer's yield to maturity determined by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) using the taxpayer's basis (for purposes of determining loss on sale or exchange) of the obligation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) compounding at the close of each accrual period (as defined in section 1272(a)(5)).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule where earlier call date is used</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), if the amount payable on an earlier call date is used under paragraph (1)(B)(ii) in determining the amortizable bond premium attributable to the period before the earlier call date, such bond shall be treated as maturing on such date for the amount so payable and then reissued on such date for the amount so payable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of certain bonds acquired in exchange for other property</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a bond is acquired by any person in exchange for other property, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the basis of such bond is determined (in whole or in part) by reference to the basis of such other property,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">for purposes of applying this subsection to such bond while held by such person, the basis of such bond shall not exceed its fair market value immediately after the exchange. A similar rule shall apply in the case of such bond while held by any other person whose basis is determined (in whole or in part) by reference to the basis in the hands of the person referred to in clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule where bond exchanged in reorganization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an exchange by the taxpayer of a bond for another bond if such exchange is a part of a reorganization (as defined in section 368). If any portion of the basis of the taxpayer in a bond transferred in such an exchange is not taken into account in determining bond premium by reason of this paragraph, such portion shall not be taken into account in determining the amount of bond premium on any bond received in the exchange.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Election as to taxable bonds</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Eligibility to elect; bonds with respect to which election permitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of bonds the interest on which is not excludible from gross income, this section shall apply only if the taxpayer has so elected.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Manner and effect of election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The election authorized under this subsection shall be made in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe. If such election is made with respect to any bond (described in paragraph (1)) of the taxpayer, it shall also apply to all such bonds held by the taxpayer at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies and to all such bonds thereafter acquired by him and shall be binding for all subsequent taxable years with respect to all such bonds of the taxpayer, unless, on application by the taxpayer, the Secretary permits him, subject to such conditions as the Secretary deems necessary, to revoke such election. In the case of bonds held by a common trust fund, as defined in section 584(a), or by a foreign personal holding company, as defined in section 552, the election authorized under this subsection shall be exercisable with respect to such bonds only by the common trust fund or foreign personal holding company. In case of bonds held by an estate or trust, the election authorized under this subsection shall be exercisable with respect to such bonds only by the fiduciary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Bond defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;bond&rdquo; means any bond, debenture, note, or certificate <!-- PDFPage:520 -->or other evidence of indebtedness, but does not include any such obligation which constitutes stock in trade of the taxpayer or any such obligation of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year, or any such obligation held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Treatment as offset to interest payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in regulations, in the case of any taxable bond&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount of any bond premium shall be allocated among the interest payments on the bond under rules similar to the rules of subsection (b)(3), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in lieu of any deduction under subsection (a), the amount of any premium so allocated to any interest payment shall be applied against (and operate to reduce) the amount of such interest payment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;taxable bond&rdquo; means any bond the interest of which is not excludable from gross income.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A taxpayer engaged in the business of farming may treat expenditures which are paid or incurred by him during the taxable year for the purpose of soil or water conservation in respect of land used in farming, or for the prevention of erosion of land used in farming, as expenses which are not chargeable to capital account. The expenditures so treated shall be allowed as a deduction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount deductible under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall not exceed 25 percent of the gross income derived from farming during the taxable year. If for any taxable year the total of the expenditures treated as expenses which are not chargeable to capital account exceeds 25 percent of the gross income derived from farming during the taxable year, such excess shall be deductible for succeeding taxable years in order of time; but the amount deductible under this section for any one such succeeding taxable year (including the expenditures actually paid or incurred during the taxable year) shall not exceed 25 percent of the gross income derived from farming during the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (a)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;expenditures which are paid or incurred by him during the taxable year for <!-- PDFPage:534 -->the purpose of soil or water conservation in respect of land used in farming, or for the prevention of erosion of land used in farming&rdquo; means expenditures paid or incurred for the treatment or moving of earth, including (but not limited to) leveling, grading and terracing, contour furrowing, the construction, control, and protection of diversion channels, drainage ditches, earthen dams, watercourses, outlets, and ponds, the eradication of brush, and the planting of windbreaks. Such term does not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the purchase, construction, installation, or improvement of structures, appliances, or facilities which are of a character which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any amount paid or incurred which is allowable as a deduction without regard to this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, such term also includes any amount, not otherwise allowable as a deduction, paid or incurred to satisfy any part of an assessment levied by a soil or water conservation or drainage district to defray expenditures made by such district (i) which, if paid or incurred by the taxpayer, would without regard to this sentence constitute expenditures deductible under this section, or (ii) for property of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167 and used in the soil or water conservation or drainage district's business as such (to the extent that the taxpayer's share of the assessment levied on the members of the district for such property does not exceed 10 percent of such assessment).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;land used in farming&rdquo; means land used (before or simultaneously with the expenditures described in paragraph (1)) by the taxpayer or his tenant for the production of crops, fruits, or other agricultural products or for the sustenance of livestock.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Additional limitations.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Expenditures must be consistent with soil conservation plan</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, subsection (a) shall not apply to any expenditures unless such expenditures are consistent with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the plan (if any) approved by the Soil Conservation Service of the Department of Agriculture for the area in which the land is located, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if there is no plan described in clause (i), any soil conservation plan of a comparable State agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Certain wetland, etc., activities not qualified</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subsection (a) shall not apply to any expenditures in connection with the draining or filling of wetlands or land preparation for center pivot irrigation systems.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) When method may be adopted</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Without consent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A taxpayer may, without the consent of the Secretary, adopt the method provided in this section for his first taxable year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which begins after December 31, 1953, and ends after August 16, 1954, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for which expenditures described in subsection (a) are paid or incurred.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) With consent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A taxpayer may, with the consent of the Secretary, adopt at any time the method provided in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Scope</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The method adopted under this section shall apply to all expenditures described in subsection (a). The method adopted shall be adhered to in computing taxable income for the taxable year and for all subsequent taxable years unless, with the approval of the Secretary, a change to a different method is authorized with respect to part or all of such expenditures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Rules applicable to assessments for depreciable property</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amounts treated as paid or incurred over 9-year period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an assessment levied to defray expenditures for property described in clause (ii) of the last sentence of subsection (c)(1), if the amount of such assessment paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the taxable year (determined without the application of this paragraph) is in excess of an amount equal to 10 percent of the aggregate amounts which have been and will be assessed as the taxpayer's share of the expenditures by the district for such property, and if such excess is more than $500, the entire excess shall be treated as paid or incurred ratably over each of the 9 succeeding taxable years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Disposition of land during 9-year period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If paragraph (1) applies to an assessment and the land with respect to which such assessment was made is sold or otherwise disposed of by the taxpayer (other than by the reason of his death) during the 9 succeeding taxable years, any amount of the excess described in paragraph (1) which has not been treated as paid or incurred for a taxable year ending on or before the sale or other disposition shall be added to the adjusted basis of such land immediately prior to its sale or other disposition and shall not thereafter be treated as paid or incurred ratably under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Disposition by reason of death</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If paragraph (1) applies to an assessment and the taxpayer dies during the 9 succeeding taxable years, any amount of the excess described in paragraph (1) which has not been treated as paid or incurred for a taxable year ending before his death shall be treated as paid or incurred in the taxable year in which he dies.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an activity engaged in by an individual or an S corporation, if such activity is not engaged in for profit, no deduction attributable to such activity shall be allowed under this chapter except as provided in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deductions allowable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an activity not engaged in for profit to which subsection (a) applies, there shall be allowed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the deductions which would be allowable under this chapter for the taxable year without regard to whether or not such activity is engaged in for profit, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a deduction equal to the amount of the deductions which would be allowable under this chapter for the taxable year only if such activity were engaged in for profit, but only to the extent that the gross income derived from such activity for the taxable year exceeds the deductions allowable by reason of paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Activity not engaged in for profit defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;activity not engaged in for profit&rdquo; means any activity other than one with respect to which deductions are allowable for the taxable year under section 162 or under paragraph (1) or (2) of section 212.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Presumption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the gross income derived from an activity for 3 or more of the taxable years in the period of 5 consecutive taxable years which ends with the taxable year exceeds the deductions attributable to such activity (determined without regard to whether or not such activity is engaged in for profit), then, unless the Secretary establishes to the contrary, such activity shall be presumed for purposes of this chapter for such taxable year to be an activity engaged in for profit. In the case of an activity which consists in major part of the breeding, training, showing, or racing of horses, the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;2&rdquo; for &ldquo;3&rdquo; and &ldquo;7&rdquo; for &ldquo;5&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special rule</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A determination as to whether the presumption provided by subsection (d) applies with respect to any activity shall, if the taxpayer so elects, not be made before the close of the fourth taxable year (sixth taxable year, in the case of an activity described in the last sentence of such subsection) following the taxable year in which the taxpayer first engages in the activity. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a taxpayer shall be treated as not having engaged in an activity during any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Initial period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the taxpayer makes an election under paragraph (1), the presumption provided by subsection (d) shall apply to each taxable year in the 5-taxable year (or 7-taxable year) period beginning with the taxable year in which the taxpayer first engages in the activity, if the gross income derived from the activity for 3 (or 2 if applicable) or more of the taxable years in such period exceeds the deductions attributable to the activity (determined without re<!-- PDFPage:542 -->gard to whether or not the activity is engaged in for profit).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An election under paragraph (1) shall be made at such time and manner, and subject to such terms and conditions, as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Time for assessing deficiency attributable to activity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a taxpayer makes an election under paragraph (1) with respect to an activity, the statutory period for the assessment of any deficiency attributable to such activity shall not expire before the expiration of 2 years after the date prescribed by law (determined without extensions) for filing the return of tax under chapter 1 for the last taxable year in the period of 5 taxable years (or 7 taxable years) to which the election relates. Such deficiency may be assessed notwithstanding the provisions of any law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such an assessment.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The maximum amount of the deduction allowed by subsection (a) for any taxpayer for any taxable year shall not exceed the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount necessary to fund (with level funding) the remaining unfunded liability of the taxpayer for black lung claims filed (or expected to be filed) by (or with respect to) past or present employees of the taxpayer, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the aggregate amount necessary to increase each trust described in section 501(c)(21) to the amount required to pay all amounts payable out of such trust for the taxable year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 10 taxable years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;miner&rdquo; has the same meaning as such term has when used in section 402(d) of the Black Lung Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 902(d)).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Time when contributions deemed made</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, a taxpayer shall be deemed to have made a payment of a contribution on the last day of a taxable year if the payment is on account of that taxable year and is made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return for that taxable year (including extensions thereof).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Contributions to be in cash or certain other items</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) with respect to any contribution to a trust described in section 501(c)(21) other than a contribution in cash or in items in which such trust may invest under subclause (II) of section 501(c)(21)(A)(ii).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Denial of section 162 deduction with respect to liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No deduction shall be allowed under section 162(a) with respect to any liability taken into account in determining the deduction under subsection (a) of this section of the taxpayer (or a predecessor).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If the amount of the deduction determined under subsection (a) for the taxable year (without regard to the limitation imposed by subsection (b)) with respect to a trust exceeds the limitation imposed by subsection (b) for the taxable year, the excess shall be carried over to the succeeding taxable year and treated as contributed to the trust during that year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definition of black lung benefit claim</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;black lung benefit claim&rdquo; means a claim for compensation for disability or death due to pneumoconiosis under part C of title IV of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 or under any State law providing for such compensation.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of dividends received by a corporation from a qualified 10-percent owned foreign corporation, there shall be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to the percent (specified in section 243 for the taxable year) of the U.S.-source portion of such dividends.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Qualified 10-percent owned foreign corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;qualified 10-percent owned foreign corporation&rdquo; means any foreign corporation (other than a foreign personal holding company or passive foreign investment company) if at <!-- PDFPage:584 -->least 10 percent of the stock of such corporation (by vote and value) is owned by the taxpayer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) U.S.-source portion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the U.S.-source portion of any dividend is an amount which bears the same ratio to such dividend as&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the total post-1986 undistributed earnings.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Post-1986 undistributed earnings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;post-1986 undistributed earnings&rdquo; has the meaning given to such term by section 902(c)(1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Post-1986 undistributed U.S. earnings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;post-1986 undistributed U.S. earnings&rdquo; means the portion of the post-1986 undistributed earnings which is attributable to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) income of the qualified 10-percent owned foreign corporation which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and subject to tax under this chapter, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any dividend received (directly or through a wholly owned foreign corporation) from a domestic corporation at least 80 percent of the stock of which (by vote and value) is owned (directly or through such wholly owned foreign corporation) by the qualified 10-percent owned foreign corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the 1st day on which the requirements of paragraph (2) are met with respect to any foreign corporation is in a taxable year of such corporation beginning after December 31, 1986, the post-1986 undistributed earnings and the post-1986 undistributed U.S. earnings of such corporation shall be determined by only taking into account periods beginning on and after the 1st day of the 1st taxable year in which such requirements are met.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Coordination with subsection (b)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Earnings and profits of any qualified 10-percent owned foreign corporation for any taxable year shall not be taken into account under this subsection if the deduction provided by subsection (b) would be allowable with respect to dividends paid out of such earnings and profits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Disallowance of foreign tax credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No credit shall be allowed under section 901 for any taxes paid or accrued (or treated as paid or accrued) with respect to the United States-source portion of any dividend received by a corporation from a qualified 10-percent-owned foreign corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Coordination with section 904</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of section 904, the U.S.-source portion of any dividend received by a corporation from a qualified 10-percent owned foreign corporation shall be treated as from sources in the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) under a treaty obligation of the United States (applied without regard to this subsection), such portion would be treated as arising from sources outside the United States, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the taxpayer chooses the benefits of this paragraph,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">this subsection shall not apply to such dividend (but subsections (a), (b), and (c) of section 904 and sections 902, 907, and 960 shall be applied separately with respect to such portion of such dividend).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(11) Coordination with section 1248</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible dividends</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the taxable year of the foreign corporation out of the earnings and profits of which such dividends are paid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certain dividends received from FSC</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception for certain dividends</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any dividend which is distributed out of earnings and profits attributable to foreign trade income which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is section 923(a)(2) nonexempt income (within the meaning of section 927(d)(6)), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) would not, but for section 923(a)(4), be treated as exempt foreign trade income.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) No deduction under subsection (a) or (b)</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Stock issued on or after October 1, 1942, shall be deemed for purposes of this paragraph to have been issued before October 1, 1942, if it was issued to refund or replace bonds or debentures issued before October 1, 1942, or to refund or replace other preferred stock (including stock which is preferred stock by reason of this subparagraph or subparagraph (D)), but only to the extent that the par or stated value of the new stock does not exceed the par, stated, or face value of the bonds or debentures issued before October 1, 1942, or the other preferred stock, which such new stock is issued to refund or replace.</p>

For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of a personal service corporation (within the meaning of section 441(i)(2)), such corporation and any employee-owner (within the meaning of section 269A(b)(2), as modified by section 441(i)(2)) shall be treated as persons specified in subsection (b).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of a sale or exchange of property to the taxpayer a loss sustained by the transferor is not allowable to the transferor as a deduction by reason of subsection (a)(1) (or by reason of section 24(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939); and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then such gain shall be recognized only to the extent that it exceeds so much of such loss as is properly allocable to the property sold or otherwise disposed of by the taxpayer. This subsection applies with respect to taxable years ending after December 31, 1953.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Affiliated groups</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which the issuing corporation is a member of an affiliated group, the application of this section shall be determined, pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by treating all of the members of the affiliated group in the aggregate as the issuing corporation, except that the ratio of debt to equity of, projected earnings of, and annual interest to be paid or incurred by any corporation (other than the issuing corporation determined without regard to this subsection) shall be included in the determinations required under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (b)(4) as of any day only if such corporation is a member of the affiliated group on such day, and, in determining projected earnings of such corporation under subsection (c)(3), there shall be taken into account only the earnings and profits of such corporation for the period during which it was a member of the affiliated group. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;affiliated group&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to such term by section 1504(a), except that all corporations other than the acquired corporation shall be treated as includible corporations (without any exclusion under section 1504(b)) and the acquired corporation shall not be treated as an includible corporation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Any extension, renewal, or refinancing of an obligation evidencing a preexisting indebtedness shall not be deemed to be the issuance of a new obligation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Any obligation which is corporate acquisition indebtedness of the issuing corporation is also corporate acquisition indebtedness of any corporation which becomes liable for such obligation as guarantor, endorser, or indemnitor or which assumes liability for such obligation in any transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Certain obligations issued after October 9, 1969</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, an obligation shall not be corporate acquisition indebtedness if issued after October 9, 1969, to provide consideration for the acquisition of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) stock or assets pursuant to a binding written contract which was in effect on October 9, 1969, and at all times thereafter before such acquisition, or</p>
