<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized and required to make the inquiries, determinations, and assessments of all taxes (including interest, additional amounts, additions to the tax, and assessable penalties) imposed by this title, or accruing under any former internal revenue law, which have not been duly paid by stamp at the time and in the manner provided by law. Such authority shall extend to and include the following:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Taxes shown on return</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall assess all taxes determined by the taxpayer or by the Secretary as to which returns or lists are made under this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Unpaid taxes payable by stamp</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Omitted stamps</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Whenever any article upon which a tax is required to be paid by means of a stamp is sold or removed for sale or use by the manufacturer thereof or whenever any transaction or act upon which a tax is required to be paid by means of a stamp occurs without the use of the proper stamp, it shall be the duty of the Secretary, upon such information as he can obtain, to estimate the amount of tax which has been omitted to be paid and to make assessment therefor upon the person or persons the Secretary determines to be liable for such tax.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Check or money order not duly paid</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case in which a check or money order received under authority of section 6311 as payment for stamps is not duly paid, the unpaid amount may be immediately assessed as if it were a tax imposed by this title, due at the time of such receipt, from the person who tendered such check or money order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Erroneous income tax prepayment credits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If on any return or claim for refund of income taxes under subtitle A there is an overstatement of the credit for income tax withheld at the source, or of the amount paid as estimated income tax, the amount so overstated which is allowed against the tax shown on the return or which is allowed as a credit or refund may be assessed by the Secretary in the same manner as in the case of a mathematical or clerical error appearing upon the return, except that the provisions of section 6213(b)(2) (relating to abatement of mathematical or clerical error assessments) shall not apply with regard to any assessment under this paragraph.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2436 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount not to be assessed</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Compensation of child</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any income tax under chapter 1 assessed against a child, to the extent attributable to amounts includible in the gross income of the child, and not of the parent, solely by reason of section 73(a), shall, if not paid by the child, for all purposes be considered as having also been properly assessed against the parent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Deficiency proceedings</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>For special rules applicable to deficiencies of income, estate, gift, and certain excise taxes, see subchapter B.</strong></p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Time for filing petition and restriction on assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 90 days, or 150 days if the notice is addressed to a person outside the United States, after the notice of deficiency authorized in section 6212 is mailed (not counting Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia as the last day), the taxpayer may file a petition with the Tax Court for a redetermination of the deficiency. Except as otherwise provided in section 6851, 6852, or 6861 no assessment of a deficiency in respect of any tax imposed by subtitle A, or B, chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 and no levy or proceeding in court for its collection shall be made, begun, or prosecuted until such notice has been mailed to the taxpayer, nor until the expiration of such 90-day or 150-day period, as the case may be, nor, if a petition has been filed with the Tax Court, until the decision of the Tax Court has become final. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 7421(a), the making of such assessment or the beginning of such proceeding or levy during the time such prohibition is in force may be enjoined by a proceeding in the <!-- PDFPage:2444 -->proper court, including the Tax Court. The Tax Court shall have no jurisdiction to enjoin any action or proceeding under this subsection unless a timely petition for a redetermination of the deficiency has been filed and then only in respect of the deficiency that is the subject of such petition.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exceptions to restrictions on assessment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Assessments arising out of mathematical or clerical errors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the taxpayer is notified that, on account of a mathematical or clerical error appearing on the return, an amount of tax in excess of that shown on the return is due, and that an assessment of the tax has been or will be made on the basis of what would have been the correct amount of tax but for the mathematical or clerical error, such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency for the purposes of subsection (a) (prohibiting assessment and collection until notice of the deficiency has been mailed), or of section 6212(c)(1) (restricting further deficiency letters), or of section 6512(a) (prohibiting credits or refunds after petition to the Tax Court), and the taxpayer shall have no right to file a petition with the Tax Court based on such notice, nor shall such assessment or collection be prohibited by the provisions of subsection (a) of this section. Each notice under this paragraph shall set forth the error alleged and an explanation thereof.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Abatement of assessment of mathematical or clerical errors</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Request for abatement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding section 6404(b), a taxpayer may file with the Secretary within 60 days after notice is sent under paragraph (1) a request for an abatement of any assessment specified in such notice, and upon receipt of such request, the Secretary shall abate the assessment. Any reassessment of the tax with respect to which an abatement is made under this subparagraph shall be subject to the deficiency procedures prescribed by this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Stay of collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any assessment referred to in paragraph (1), notwithstanding paragraph (1), no levy or proceeding in court for the collection of such assessment shall be made, begun, or prosecuted during the period in which such assessment may be abated under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Assessments arising out of tentative carryback or refund adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that the amount applied, credited, or refunded under section 6411 is in excess of the overassessment attributable to the carryback or the amount described in section 1341(b)(1) with respect to which such amount was applied, credited, or refunded, he may assess without regard to the provisions of paragraph (2) the amount of the excess as a deficiency as if it were due to a mathematical or clerical error appearing on the return.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Assessment of amount paid</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any amount paid as a tax or in respect of a tax may be assessed upon the receipt of such payment notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a). In any case where such amount is paid after the mailing of a notice of deficiency under section 6212, such payment shall not deprive the Tax Court of jurisdiction over such deficiency determined under section 6211 without regard to such assessment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Failure to file petition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the taxpayer does not file a petition with the Tax Court within the time prescribed in subsection (a), the deficiency, notice of which has been mailed to the taxpayer, shall be assessed, and shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Waiver of restrictions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The taxpayer shall at any time (whether or not a notice of deficiency has been issued) have the right, by a signed notice in writing filed with the Secretary, to waive the restrictions provided in subsection (a) on the assessment and collection of the whole or any part of the deficiency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Suspension of filing period for certain excise taxes</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Jurisdiction as to increase of deficiency, additional amounts, or additions to the tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided by section 7463, the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction to redetermine the correct amount of the deficiency even if the amount so redetermined is greater than the amount of the deficiency, notice of which has been mailed to the taxpayer, and to determine whether any additional amount, or any addition to the tax should be assessed, if claim therefor is asserted by the Secretary at or before the hearing or a rehearing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Jurisdiction over other years and quarters</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Tax Court in redetermining a deficiency of income tax for any taxable year or of gift tax for any calendar year or calendar quarter shall consider such facts with relation to the taxes for other years or calendar quarters as may be necessary correctly to redetermine the amount of such deficiency, but in so doing shall have no jurisdiction to determine whether or not the tax for any other year or calendar quarter has been overpaid or underpaid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Taxes imposed by section 507 or chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Tax Court, in redetermining a deficiency of any tax imposed by section 507 or chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 for any period, act, or failure to act, shall consider such facts with relation to the taxes under chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 for other periods, acts, or failures to act as may be necessary correctly to redetermine the amount of such deficiency, but in so doing shall have no jurisdiction to determine whether or not the taxes under chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 for any other period, act, or failure to act have been overpaid or underpaid. The Tax Court, in redetermining a deficiency of any second tier tax (as defined in section 4963(b)), shall make a determination with respect to whether the taxable event has been corrected.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Final decisions of Tax Court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this chapter, chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44, and subtitles A or B the date on which a decision of the Tax Court becomes final shall be determined according to the provisions of section 7481.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Priority of the Tax Court action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If more than 1 action is brought under paragraph (1) with respect to any partnership for <!-- PDFPage:2453 -->any partnership taxable year, the first such action brought in the Tax Court shall go forward.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Priority outside the Tax Court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If more than 1 action is brought under paragraph (1) with respect to any partnership for any taxable year but no such action is brought in the Tax Court, the first such action brought shall go forward.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In order to be party to action</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) To file petition</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Jurisdictional requirement for bringing action in district court or Court of Federal Claims</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A readjustment petition under this section may be filed in a district court of the United States or the Court of Federal Claims only if the partner filing the petition deposits with the Secretary, on or before the day the petition is filed, the amount by which the tax liability of the partner would be increased if the treatment of partnership items on the partner's return were made consistent with the treatment of partnership items on the partnership return, as adjusted by the final partnership administrative adjustment. In the case of a petition filed by a 5-percent group, the requirement of the preceding sentence shall apply to each member of the group. The court may by order provide that the jurisdictional requirements of this paragraph are satisfied where there has been a good faith attempt to satisfy such requirements and any shortfall in the amount required to be deposited is timely corrected.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Refund on request</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an action brought in a district court of the United States or in the Court of Federal Claims is dismissed by reason of the priority of a Tax Court action under paragraph (2) of subsection (b), the Secretary shall, at the request of the partner who made the deposit, refund the amount deposited under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Interest payable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any amount deposited under paragraph (1), while deposited, shall not be treated as a payment of tax for purposes of this title (other than chapter 67).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Scope of judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A court with which a petition is filed in accordance with this section shall have jurisdiction to determine all partnership items of the partnership for the partnership taxable year to which the notice of final partnership administrative adjustment relates and the proper allocation of such items among the partners.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Determination of court reviewable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any determination by a court under this section shall have the force and effect of a decision of the Tax Court or a final judgment or decree of the district court or the Court of Federal Claims, as the case may be, and shall be reviewable as such. With respect to the partnership, only the tax matters partner, a notice partner, or a 5-percent group may seek review of a determination by a court under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Effect of decision dismissing action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an action brought under this section is dismissed (other than under paragraph (4) of subsection (b)), the decision of the court dismissing the action shall be considered as its decision that the notice of final partnership administrative adjustment is correct, and an appropriate order shall be entered in the records of the court.</p>
