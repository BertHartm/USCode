<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized and required to make the inquiries, determinations, and assessments of all taxes (including interest, additional amounts, additions to the tax, and assessable penalties) imposed by this title, or accruing under any former internal revenue law, which have not been duly paid by stamp at the time and in the manner provided by law. Such authority shall extend to and include the following:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Taxes shown on return</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall assess all taxes determined by the taxpayer or by the Secretary as to which returns or lists are made under this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Unpaid taxes payable by stamp</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Omitted stamps</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Whenever any article upon which a tax is required to be paid by means of a stamp is sold or removed for sale or use by the manufacturer thereof or whenever any transaction or act upon which a tax is required to be paid by means of a stamp occurs without the use of the proper stamp, it shall be the duty of the Secretary, upon such information as he can obtain, to estimate the amount of tax which has been omitted to be paid and to make assessment therefor upon the person or persons the Secretary determines to be liable for such tax.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Check or money order not duly paid</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case in which a check or money order received under authority of section 6311 as payment for stamps is not duly paid, the unpaid amount may be immediately assessed as if it were a tax imposed by this title, due at the time of such receipt, from the person who tendered such check or money order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Erroneous income tax prepayment credits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If on any return or claim for refund of income taxes under subtitle A there is an overstatement of the credit for income tax withheld at the source, or of the amount paid as estimated income tax, the amount so overstated which is allowed against the tax shown on the return or which is allowed as a credit or refund may be assessed by the Secretary in the same manner as in the case of a mathematical or clerical error appearing upon the return, except that the provisions of section 6213(b)(2) (relating to abatement of mathematical or clerical error assessments) shall not apply with regard to any assessment under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount not to be assessed</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Estimated income tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No unpaid amount of estimated income tax required to be paid under section 6654 or 6655 shall be assessed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Federal unemployment tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No unpaid amount of Federal unemployment tax for any calendar quarter or other period of a calendar year, computed as provided in section 6157, shall be assessed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Compensation of child</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any income tax under chapter 1 assessed against a child, to the extent attributable to amounts includible in the gross income of the child, and not of the parent, solely by reason of section 73(a), shall, if not paid by the child, for all purposes be considered as having also been properly assessed against the parent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Required reasonable verification of information returns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any court proceeding, if a taxpayer asserts a reasonable dispute with respect to any item of income reported on an information return filed with the Secretary under subpart B or C of part III of subchapter A of chapter 61 by a third party and the taxpayer has fully cooperated with the Secretary (including providing, within a reasonable period of time, access to and inspection of all witnesses, information, and documents within the control of the taxpayer as reasonably requested by the Secretary), the Secretary shall have the burden of producing reasonable and probative information concerning such deficiency in addition to such information return.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Deficiency proceedings</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>For special rules applicable to deficiencies of income, estate, gift, and certain excise taxes, see subchapter B.</strong></p>

Notwithstanding the provisions of section 7421(a), the making of such assessment or the beginning of such proceeding or levy during the time such prohibition is in force may be enjoined by a proceeding in the proper court, including the Tax Court, and a refund may be ordered by such court of any amount collected within the period during which the Secretary is prohibited from collecting by levy or through a proceeding in court under the provisions of this subsection. The Tax Court shall have no jurisdiction to enjoin any action or proceeding or order any refund under this subsection unless a timely petition for a redetermination of the deficiency has been filed and then only in respect of the deficiency that is the subject of such petition. Any petition filed with the Tax Court on or before the last date specified for filing such petition by the Secretary in the notice of deficiency shall be treated as timely filed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exceptions to restrictions on assessment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Assessments arising out of mathematical or clerical errors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the taxpayer is notified that, on account of a mathematical or clerical error appearing on the return, an amount of tax in excess of that shown on the return is due, and that an assessment of the tax has been or will be made on the basis of what would have been the correct amount of tax but for the mathematical or clerical error, such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency for the purposes of subsection (a) (prohibiting assessment and collection until notice of the deficiency has been mailed), or of section 6212(c)(1) (restricting further deficiency letters), or of section 6512(a) (prohibiting credits or refunds after petition to the Tax Court), and the taxpayer shall have no right to file a petition with the Tax Court based on such notice, nor shall such assessment or collection be prohibited by the provisions of subsection (a) of this section. Each notice under this paragraph shall set forth the error alleged and an explanation thereof.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Abatement of assessment of mathematical or clerical errors</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Request for abatement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding section 6404(b), a taxpayer may file with the Secretary within 60 days after notice is sent under paragraph (1) a request for an abatement of any assessment specified in such notice, and upon receipt of such request, the Secretary shall abate the assessment. Any reassessment of the tax with respect to which an abatement is made under this subparagraph shall be subject to the deficiency procedures prescribed by this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Stay of collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any assessment referred to in paragraph (1), notwithstanding paragraph (1), no levy or proceeding in court for the collection of such assessment shall be made, begun, or prosecuted during the period in which such assessment may be abated under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Assessments arising out of tentative carryback or refund adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that the amount applied, credited, or refunded under section 6411 is in excess of the overassessment attributable to the carryback or the amount described in section 1341(b)(1) with respect to which such amount was applied, credited, or refunded, he may assess without regard to the provisions of paragraph (2) the amount of the excess as a deficiency as if it were due to a mathematical or clerical error appearing on the return.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Assessment of amount paid</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any amount paid as a tax or in respect of a tax may be assessed upon the receipt of such payment notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a). In any case where such amount is paid after the mailing of a notice of deficiency under section 6212, such payment shall not deprive the Tax Court of jurisdiction over such deficiency determined under section 6211 without regard to such assessment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Failure to file petition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the taxpayer does not file a petition with the Tax Court within the time prescribed in subsection (a), the deficiency, notice of which has been mailed to the taxpayer, shall be assessed, and shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Waiver of restrictions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The taxpayer shall at any time (whether or not a notice of deficiency has been issued) have the right, by a signed notice in writing filed with the Secretary, to waive the restrictions provided in subsection (a) on the assessment and collection of the whole or any part of the deficiency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Suspension of filing period for certain excise taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The running of the time prescribed by subsection (a) for filing a petition in the Tax Court with respect to the taxes imposed by section 4941 (relating to taxes on self-dealing), 4942 (relating to taxes on failure to distribute income), 4943 (relating to taxes on excess business holdings), 4944 (relating to investments which jeopardize charitable purpose), 4945 (relating to taxes on taxable expenditures), 4951 (relating to taxes on self-dealing), or 4952 (relating to taxes on taxable expenditures), 4955 (relating to taxes on political expenditures), 4958 (relating to private excess benefit), 4971 (relating to excise taxes on failure to meet minimum funding standard), 4975 (relating to excise taxes on prohibited transactions) shall be suspended for any period during which the Secretary has extended the time allowed for making correction under section 4963(e).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2930 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Coordination with title 11</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Suspension of running of period for filing petition in title 11 cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case under title 11 of the United States Code, the running of the time prescribed by subsection (a) for filing a petition in the Tax Court with respect to any deficiency shall be suspended for the period during which the debtor is prohibited by reason of such case from filing a petition in the Tax Court with respect to such deficiency, and for 60 days thereafter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain action not taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of the second and third sentences of subsection (a), the filing of a proof of claim or request for payment (or the taking of any other action) in a case under title 11 of the United States Code shall not be treated as action prohibited by such second sentence.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Subchapter B shall be applied separately with respect to each deficiency described in subparagraph (A) attributable to each partnership.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Notwithstanding any other law or rule of law, any notice or proceeding under subchapter B with respect to a deficiency described in this paragraph shall not preclude or be precluded by any other notice, proceeding, or determination with respect to a partner's tax liability for a taxable year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a taxpayer files an oversheltered return for a taxable year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary makes a determination with respect to the treatment of items (other than partnership items) of such taxpayer for such taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the adjustments resulting from such determination do not give rise to a deficiency (as defined in section 6211) but would give rise to a deficiency if there were no net loss from partnership items,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Secretary is authorized to send a notice of adjustment reflecting such determination to the taxpayer by certified or registered mail.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Oversheltered return</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;oversheltered return&rdquo; means an income tax return which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shows no taxable income for the taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shows a net loss from partnership items.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Judicial review in the Tax Court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 90 days, or 150 days if the notice is addressed to a person outside the United States, after the day on which the notice of adjustment authorized in subsection (a) is mailed to the taxpayer, the taxpayer may file a petition with the Tax Court for redetermination of the adjustments. Upon the filing of such a petition, the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction to make a declaration with respect to all items (other than partnership items and affected items which require partner level determinations as described in section 6230(a)(2)(A)(i)) for the taxable year to which the notice of adjustment relates, in accordance with the principles of section 6214(a). <!-- PDFPage:2952 -->Any such declaration shall have the force and effect of a decision of the Tax Court and shall be reviewable as such.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Failure to file petition</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), if the taxpayer does not file a petition with the Tax Court within the time prescribed in subsection (c), the determination of the Secretary set forth in the notice of adjustment that was mailed to the taxpayer shall be deemed to be correct.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply after the date that the taxpayer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) files a petition with the Tax Court within the time prescribed in subsection (c) with respect to a subsequent notice of adjustment relating to the same taxable year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) files a claim for refund of an overpayment of tax under section 6511 for the taxable year involved.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If a claim for refund is filed by the taxpayer, then solely for purposes of determining (for the taxable year involved) the amount of any computational adjustment in connection with a partnership proceeding under this subchapter (other than under this section) or the amount of any deficiency attributable to affected items in a proceeding under section 6230(a)(2), the items that are the subject of the notice of adjustment shall be presumed to have been correctly reported on the taxpayer's return during the pendency of the refund claim (and, if within the time prescribed by section 6532 the taxpayer commences a civil action for refund under section 7422, until the decision in the refund action becomes final).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitations period</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any notice to a taxpayer under subsection (a) shall be mailed before the expiration of the period prescribed by section 6501 (relating to the period of limitations on assessment).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Suspension when Secretary mails notice of adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary mails a notice of adjustment to the taxpayer for a taxable year, the period of limitations on the making of assessments shall be suspended for the period during which the Secretary is prohibited from making the assessment (and, in any event, if a proceeding in respect of the notice of adjustment is placed on the docket of the Tax Court, until the decision of the Tax Court becomes final), and for 60 days thereafter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Restrictions on assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in section 6851, 6852, or 6861, no assessment of a deficiency with respect to any tax imposed by subtitle A attributable to any item (other than a partnership item or any item affected by a partnership item) shall be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) until the expiration of the applicable 90-day or 150-day period set forth in subsection (c) for filing a petition with the Tax Court, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if a petition has been filed with the Tax Court, until the decision of the Tax Court has become final.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Further notices of adjustment restricted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary mails a notice of adjustment to the taxpayer for a taxable year and the taxpayer files a petition with the Tax Court within the time prescribed in subsection (c), the Secretary may not mail another such notice to the taxpayer with respect to the same taxable year in the absence of a showing of fraud, malfeasance, or misrepresentation of a material fact.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Coordination with other proceedings under this subchapter</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The treatment of any item that has been determined pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) shall be taken into account in determining the amount of any computational adjustment that is made in connection with a partnership proceeding under this subchapter (other than under this section), or the amount of any deficiency attributable to affected items in a proceeding under section 6230(a)(2), for the taxable year involved. Notwithstanding any other law or rule of law pertaining to the period of limitations on the making of assessments, for purposes of the preceding sentence, any adjustment made in accordance with this section shall be taken into account regardless of whether any assessment has been made with respect to such adjustment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule in case of computational adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a computational adjustment that is made in connection with a partnership proceeding under this subchapter (other than under this section), the provisions of paragraph (1) shall apply only if the computational adjustment is made within the period prescribed by section 6229 for assessing any tax under subtitle A which is attributable to any partnership item or affected item for the taxable year involved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Conversion to deficiency proceeding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) after the notice referred to in subsection (a) is mailed to a taxpayer for a taxable year but before the expiration of the period for filing a petition with the Tax Court under subsection (c) (or, if a petition is filed with the Tax Court, before the Tax Court makes a declaration for that taxable year), the treatment of any partnership item for the taxable year is finally determined, or any such item ceases to be a partnership item pursuant to section 6231(b), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as a result of that final determination or cessation, a deficiency can be determined with respect to the items that are the subject of the notice of adjustment,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the notice of adjustment shall be treated as a notice of deficiency under section 6212 and any petition filed in respect of the notice shall be treated as an action brought under section 6213.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2953 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Finally determined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the treatment of partnership items shall be treated as finally determined if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary or the Attorney General (or his delegate) enters into a settlement agreement (within the meaning of section 6224) with the taxpayer regarding such items,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment has been issued and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) no petition has been filed under section 6226 and the time for doing so has expired, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a petition has been filed under section 6226 and the decision of the court has become final, or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the period within which any tax attributable to such items may be assessed against the taxpayer has expired.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Special rules if Secretary incorrectly determines applicable procedure</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Special rule if Secretary erroneously mails notice of adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary erroneously determines that subchapter B does not apply to a taxable year of a taxpayer and consistent with that determination timely mails a notice of adjustment to the taxpayer pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the notice of adjustment shall be treated as a notice of deficiency under section 6212 and any petition that is filed in respect of the notice shall be treated as an action brought under section 6213.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule if Secretary erroneously mails notice of deficiency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary erroneously determines that subchapter B applies to a taxable year of a taxpayer and consistent with that determination timely mails a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer pursuant to section 6212, the notice of deficiency shall be treated as a notice of adjustment under subsection (a) and any petition that is filed in respect of the notice shall be treated as an action brought under subsection (c).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6242. Procedures for taking partnership adjustments into account</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Adjustments flow through to partners for year in which adjustment takes effect</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any partnership adjustment with respect to any partnership item takes effect (within the meaning of subsection (d)(2)) during any partnership taxable year and if an election under paragraph (2) does not apply to such adjustment, such adjustment shall be taken into account in determining the amount of such item for the partnership taxable year in which such adjustment takes effect. In applying this title to any person who is (directly or indirectly) a partner in such partnership during such partnership taxable year, such adjustment shall be treated as an item actually arising during such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Partnership liable in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a partnership elects under this paragraph to not take an adjustment into account under paragraph (1),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a partnership does not make such an election but in filing its return for any partnership taxable year fails to take fully into account any partnership adjustment as required under paragraph (1), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any partnership adjustment involves a reduction in a credit which exceeds the amount of such credit determined for the partnership taxable year in which the adjustment takes effect,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the partnership shall pay to the Secretary an amount determined by applying the rules of subsection (b)(4) to the adjustments not so taken into account and any excess referred to in subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Offsetting adjustments taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a partnership adjustment requires another adjustment in a taxable year after the adjusted year and before the partnership taxable year in which such partnership adjustment takes effect, such other adjustment shall be taken into account under this subsection for the partnership taxable year in which such partnership adjustment takes effect.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Coordination with part II</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts taken into account under this subsection for any partnership taxable year shall continue to be treated as adjustments for the <!-- PDFPage:2955 -->adjusted year for purposes of determining whether such amounts may be readjusted under part II.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Partnership liable for interest and penalties</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a partnership adjustment takes effect during any partnership taxable year and such adjustment results in an imputed underpayment for the adjusted year, the partnership&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall pay to the Secretary interest computed under paragraph (2), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall be liable for any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount as provided in paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of amount of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The interest computed under this paragraph with respect to any partnership adjustment is the interest which would be determined under chapter 67&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) on the imputed underpayment determined under paragraph (4) with respect to such adjustment,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for the period beginning on the day after the return due date for the adjusted year and ending on the return due date for the partnership taxable year in which such adjustment takes effect (or, if earlier, in the case of any adjustment to which subsection (a)(2) applies, the date on which the payment under subsection (a)(2) is made).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Proper adjustments in the amount determined under the preceding sentence shall be made for adjustments required for partnership taxable years after the adjusted year and before the year in which the partnership adjustment takes effect by reason of such partnership adjustment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A partnership shall be liable for any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount for which it would have been liable if such partnership had been an individual subject to tax under chapter 1 for the adjusted year and the imputed underpayment determined under paragraph (4) were an actual underpayment (or understatement) for such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Imputed underpayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the imputed underpayment determined under this paragraph with respect to any partnership adjustment is the underpayment (if any) which would result&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by netting all adjustments to items of income, gain, loss, or deduction and by treating any net increase in income as an underpayment equal to the amount of such net increase multiplied by the highest rate of tax in effect under section 1 or 11 for the adjusted year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by taking adjustments to credits into account as increases or decreases (whichever is appropriate) in the amount of tax.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of the preceding sentence, any net decrease in a loss shall be treated as an increase in income and a similar rule shall apply to a net increase in a loss.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Administrative provisions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any payment required by subsection (a)(2) or (b)(1)(A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as if it were a tax imposed by subtitle C, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall be paid on or before the return due date for the partnership taxable year in which the partnership adjustment takes effect.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of determining interest, any payment required by subsection (a)(2) or (b)(1)(A) shall be treated as an underpayment of tax.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Penalties</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any failure by any partnership to pay on the date prescribed therefor any amount required by subsection (a)(2) or (b)(1)(A), there is hereby imposed on such partnership a penalty of 10 percent of the underpayment. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;underpayment&rdquo; means the excess of any payment required under this section over the amount (if any) paid on or before the date prescribed therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Accuracy-related and fraud penalties made applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of part II of subchapter A of chapter 68, any payment required by subsection (a)(2) shall be treated as an underpayment of tax.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definitions and special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Partnership adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;partnership adjustment&rdquo; means any adjustment in the amount of any partnership item of an electing large partnership.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in any other case, when such adjustment is made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adjusted year</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Return due date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;return due date&rdquo; means, with respect to any taxable year, the date prescribed for filing the partnership return for such taxable year (determined without regard to extensions).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the close of the 90th day after the day on which a notice of a partnership adjustment was mailed to the partnership, and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Jurisdictional requirement for bringing action in district court or Claims Court</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A readjustment petition under this section may be filed in a district court of the United States or the Claims Court only if the partnership filing the petition deposits with the Secretary, on or before the date the petition is filed, the amount for which the partnership would be liable under section 6242(b) (as of the date of the filing of the petition) if the partnership items were adjusted as provided by the notice of partnership adjustment. The court may by order provide that the jurisdictional requirements of this paragraph are satisfied where there has been a good faith attempt to satisfy such requirement and any shortfall of the amount required to be deposited is timely corrected.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Interest payable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any amount deposited under paragraph (1), while deposited, shall not be treated as a payment of tax for purposes of this title (other than chapter 67).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Scope of judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A court with which a petition is filed in accordance with this section shall have jurisdiction to determine all partnership items of the partnership for the partnership taxable year to which the notice of partnership adjustment relates and the proper allocation of such items among the partners (and the applicability of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount for which the partnership may be liable under section 6242(b)).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of court reviewable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any determination by a court under this section shall have the force and effect of a decision of the Tax Court or a final judgment or decree of the district court or the Claims Court, as the case may be, and shall be reviewable as such. The date of any such determination shall be treated as being the date of the court's order entering the decision.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect of decision dismissing action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an action brought under this section is dismissed other than by reason of a rescission under section 6245(b)(3), the decision of the court dismissing the action shall be considered as its decision that the notice of partnership adjustment is correct, and an appropriate order shall be entered in the records of the court.</p>
