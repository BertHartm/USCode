<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) detecting underpayments of tax, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) detecting and bringing to trial and punishment persons guilty of violating the internal revenue laws or conniving at the same,</p>
<br class="Q04" />

The determination of the amount of such award by the Whistleblower Office shall depend upon the extent to which the individual substantially contributed to such action.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Award in case of less substantial contribution</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the event the action described in paragraph (1) is one which the Whistleblower Office determines to be based principally on disclosures of specific allegations (other than information provided by the individual described in paragraph (1)) resulting from a judicial or administrative hearing, from a governmental report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, the Whistleblower Office may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the collected proceeds (including penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts) resulting from the action (including any related actions) or from any settlement in response to such action, taking into account the significance of the individual's information and the role of such individual and any legal representative of such individual in contributing to such action.</p>

If such individual is convicted of criminal conduct arising from the role described in the preceding sentence, the Whistleblower Office shall deny any award.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Appeal of award determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any determination regarding an award under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) may, within 30 days of such determination, be appealed to the Tax Court (and the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Application of this subsection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall apply with respect to any action&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) against any taxpayer, but in the case of any individual, only if such individual's gross income exceeds $200,000 for any taxable year subject to such action, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the tax, penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts in dispute exceed $2,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Additional rules</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) No contract necessary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No contract with the Internal Revenue Service is necessary for any individual to receive an award under this subsection.</p>
