<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Correction not barred at time of erroneous action</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Determination described in section 1312(3)(B)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a determination described in section 1312(3)(B) (relating to certain exclusions from income), adjustment shall be made under this part only if assessment of a deficiency for the taxable year in which the item is includible or against the related taxpayer was not barred, by any law or rule of law, at the time the Secretary first maintained, in a notice of deficiency sent pursuant to section 6212 or before the Tax Court that the item described in section 1312(3)(B) should be included in the gross income of the taxpayer for the taxable year to which the determination relates.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Ascertainment of amount of adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In computing the amount of an adjustment under this part there shall first be ascertained the tax previously determined for the taxable year with respect to which the error was made. The amount of the tax previously determined shall be the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount shown as the tax by the taxpayer on his return (determined as provided in section 6211(b)(1), (3), and (4), relating to the definition of deficiency), if a return was made by the taxpayer and an amount was shown as the tax by the taxpayer thereon, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amounts previously assessed (or collected without assessment) as a deficiency, over&mdash;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of rebates, as defined in section 6211(b)(2), made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">There shall then be ascertained the increase or decrease in tax previously determined which results solely from the correct treatment of the item which was the subject of the error (with due regard given to the effect of the item in the computation of gross income, taxable income, and other matters under this subtitle). A similar computation shall be made for any other taxable year affected, or treated as affected, by a net operating loss deduction (as defined in section 172) or by a capital loss carryback or carryover (as defined in section 1212), determined with reference to the taxable year with respect to which the error was made. The amount so ascertained (together with any amounts wrongfully collected as additions to the tax or interest, as a result of such error) for each taxable year shall be the amount of the adjustment for that taxable year.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2060 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The adjustment authorized in section 1311(a) shall be made by assessing and collecting, or refunding or crediting, the amount thereof in the same manner as if it were a deficiency determined by the Secretary with respect to the taxpayer as to whom the error was made or an overpayment claimed by such taxpayer, as the case may be, for the taxable year or years with respect to which an amount is ascertained under subsection (a), and as if on the date of the determination one year remained before the expiration of the periods of limitation upon assessment or filing claim for refund for such taxable year or years. If, as a result of a determination described in section 1313(a)(4), an adjustment has been made by the assessment and collection of a deficiency or the refund or credit of an overpayment, and subsequently such determination is altered or revoked, the amount of the adjustment ascertained under subsection (a) of this section shall be redetermined on the basis of such alteration or revocation and any overpayment or deficiency resulting from such redetermination shall be refunded or credited, or assessed and collected, as the case may be, as an adjustment under this part. In the case of an adjustment resulting from an increase or decrease in a net operating loss or net capital loss which is carried back to the year of adjustment, interest shall not be collected or paid for any period prior to the close of the taxable year in which the net operating loss or net capital loss arises.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjustment unaffected by other items</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount to be assessed and collected in the same manner as a deficiency, or to be refunded or credited in the same manner as an overpayment, under this part, shall not be diminished by any credit or set-off based upon any item other than the one which was the subject of the adjustment. The amount of the adjustment under this part, if paid, shall not be recovered by a claim or suit for refund or suit for erroneous refund based upon any item other than the one which was the subject of the adjustment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Periods for which adjustments may be made</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No adjustment shall be made under this part in respect of any taxable year beginning prior to January 1, 1932.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Taxes imposed by subtitle C</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This part shall not apply to any tax imposed by subtitle C (sec. 3101 and following relating to employment taxes).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the decrease in tax ascertained under subsection (a)(5)(B) exceeds the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year (computed without the deduction) such excess shall be considered to be a payment of tax on the last day prescribed by law for the payment of tax for the taxable year, and shall be refunded or credited in the same manner as if it were an overpayment for such taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subsection (a) does not apply to any deduction allowable with respect to an item which was included in gross income by reason of the sale or other disposition of stock in trade of the taxpayer (or other property of a kind which would properly have been included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the prior taxable year) or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business. This paragraph shall not apply if the deduction arises out of refunds or repayments with respect to rates made by a regulated public utility (as defined in section 7701(a)(33) without regard to the limitation contained in the last two sentences thereof) if such refunds or repayments are required to be made by the Government, political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality referred to in such section, or by an order of a court, or are made in settlement of litigation or under threat or imminence of litigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year is the amount determined under subsection (a)(5), then the deduction referred to in subsection (a)(2) shall not be taken into account for any purpose of this subtitle other than this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in any case where the deduction referred to in paragraph (4) of subsection (a) results in a net operating loss, such loss shall, for purposes of computing the tax for the taxable year under such paragraph (4), be carried back to the same extent and in the same manner as is provided under section 172; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in any case where the exclusion referred to in paragraph (5)(B) of subsection (a) results in a net operating loss or capital loss for the prior taxable year (or years), such loss shall, for purposes of computing the decrease in tax for the prior taxable year (or years) under such paragraph (5) (B), be carried back and carried over to the same extent and in the same manner as is provided under section 172 or section 1212, except that no carryover beyond the taxable year shall be taken into account.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For purposes of this chapter, the net operating loss described in paragraph (4)(A) of this subsection, or the net operating loss or capital loss described in paragraph (4)(B) of this subsection, as the case may be, shall (after the application of paragraph (4) or (5)(B) of subsection (a) for the taxable year) be taken into account under section 172 or 1212 for taxable years after the taxable year to the same extent and in the same manner as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a net operating loss sustained for the taxable year, if paragraph (4) of subsection (a) applied, or</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1351. Treatment of recoveries of foreign expropriation losses</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Election</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This section shall apply only to a recovery, by a domestic corporation subject to the tax imposed by section 11 or 801, of a foreign expropriation loss sustained by such corporation and only if such corporation was subject to the tax imposed by section 11 or 801, as the case may be, for the year of the loss and elects to have the provisions of this section apply with respect to such loss.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Time, manner, and scope</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An election under paragraph (1) shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations. An election made with respect to any foreign expropriation loss shall apply to all recoveries in respect of such loss.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definition of foreign expropriation loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;foreign expropriation loss&rdquo; means any loss sustained by reason of the expropriation, intervention, seizure, or similar taking of property by the government of any foreign country, any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of the foregoing. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a debt which becomes worthless shall, to the extent of any deduction allowed under section 166(a), be treated as a loss.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount of recovery</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of any recovery of a foreign expropriation loss is the amount of money and the fair market value of other property received in respect of such loss, determined as of the date of receipt.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule for life insurance companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of any recovery of a foreign expropriation loss includes, in the case of a life insurance company, the amount of decrease of any item taken into account under section 807(c), to the extent such decrease is attributable to the release, by reason of such loss, of its liabilities with respect to such item.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Adjustment for prior tax benefits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">That part of the amount of a recovery of a foreign expropriation loss to which this section applies which, when added to the aggregate of the amounts of previous recoveries with respect to such loss, does not exceed the allowable deductions in prior taxable years on account of such loss shall be excluded from gross income for the taxable year of the recovery for purposes of computing the tax under this subtitle; but there shall be added to, and assessed and collected as a part of, the tax under this subtitle for such taxable year an amount equal to the total increase in the tax under this subtitle for all taxable years which would result by decreasing, in an amount equal to such part of the recovery so excluded, the deductions allowable in the prior taxable years on account of such loss. For purposes of this paragraph, if the loss to which the recovery relates was taken into account as a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset, the amount of the loss shall be treated as an allowable deduction even though there were no gains against which to allow such loss.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Computation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The increase in the tax for each taxable year referred to in paragraph (1) shall be computed in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Such regulations shall give effect to previous recoveries of any kind (including recoveries described in section 111, relating to recovery of tax benefit items) with respect to any prior taxable year, but shall otherwise treat the tax previously determined for any taxable year in accordance with the principles set forth in section 1314(a) (relating to correction of errors). Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3), all credits allowable against the tax for any taxable year, and all carryovers and carrybacks affected by so decreasing the allowable deductions, shall be taken into account in computing the increase in the tax.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Foreign taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, any choice made under subpart A of part III of subchapter N (relating to foreign tax credit) for any taxable year may be changed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Substitution of current tax rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the rates of tax specified in section 11(b) for the taxable year of the recovery shall be treated as having been in effect for all prior taxable years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Gain on recovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">That part of the amount of a recovery of a foreign expropriation loss to which this section applies which is not excluded from gross income under subsection (d)(1) shall be considered for the taxable year of the recovery as gain on the involuntary conversion of property as a result of its destruction or seizure and shall be recognized or not recognized as provided in section 1033.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Basis of recovered property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The basis of property (other than money) received as a recovery of a foreign expropriation loss to which this section applies shall be an amount equal to its fair market value on the date of receipt, reduced by such part of the gain under subsection (e) which is not recognized as provided in section 1033.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Restoration of value of investments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, if the value of any interest in, or with respect to, property (including any interest represented by a security, as defined in section 165(g)(2))&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) which became worthless by reason of the expropriation, intervention, seizure, or similar taking of such property by the government of any foreign country, any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of the foregoing, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) which was taken into account as a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or with respect to which a deduction for a loss was allowed under section 165 or a deduction for a bad debt was allowed under section 166,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:2064 --><p class="statutory-body-block">is restored in whole or in part by reason of any recovery of money or other property in respect of the property which became worthless, the value so restored shall be treated as property received as a recovery in respect of such loss or such bad debt.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Special rule for evidences of indebtedness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Bonds or other evidences of indebtedness received as a recovery of a foreign expropriation loss to which this section applies shall not be considered to have any original issue discount within the meaning of section 1273(a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Adjustments for succeeding years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subtitle, proper adjustment shall be made, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the credit under section 27 (relating to foreign tax credit),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the credit under section 38 (relating to general business credit),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the net operating loss deduction under section 172, or the operations loss deduction under section 810,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the capital loss carryover under section 1212(a), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) such other items as may be specified by such regulations,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">for the taxable year of a recovery of a foreign expropriation loss to which this section applies, and for succeeding taxable years, to take into account items changed in making the computations under subsection (d) for taxable years prior to the taxable year of such recovery.</p>
