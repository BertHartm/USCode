<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Operations loss carrybacks and carryovers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Years to which loss may be carried</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The loss from operations for any taxable year (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;loss year&rdquo;) shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an operations loss carryback to each of the 3 taxable years preceding the loss year,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if the life insurance company is a new company for the loss year, an operations loss carryover to each of the 3 taxable years following the 15 taxable years described in subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of carrybacks and carryovers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The entire amount of the loss from operations for any loss year shall be carried to the earliest of the taxable years to which (by reason of paragraph (1)) such loss may be carried. The portion of such loss which shall be carried to each of the other taxable years shall be the excess (if any) of the amount of such loss over the sum of the offsets (as defined in subsection (d)) for each of the prior taxable years to which such loss may be carried.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Election for operations loss carrybacks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a loss from operations for any taxable year, the taxpayer may elect to relinquish the entire carryback period for such loss.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the operations loss deduction shall not be allowed, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the deductions allowed by sections 243 (relating to dividends received by corporations), 244 (relating to dividends received on <!-- PDFPage:1581 -->certain preferred stock of public utilities), and 245 (relating to dividends received from certain foreign corporations) shall be computed without regard to section 246(b) as modified by section 805(a)(4).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Offset defined</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (b)(2), the term &ldquo;offset&rdquo; means, with respect to any taxable year, an amount equal to that increase in the operations loss deduction for the taxable year which reduces the life insurance company taxable income (computed without regard to paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 804)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#810_1_target" name="810_1">1</a></sup> or such year to zero.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Operations loss deduction</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Transitional rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section and section 812 (as in effect before the enactment of the Life Insurance Tax Act of 1984), this section shall be treated as a continuation of such section 812.</p>
