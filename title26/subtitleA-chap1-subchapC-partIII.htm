<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Receipt of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If subsection (a) would apply to an exchange but for the fact that there is received, in addition to the stock permitted to be received under subsection (a), other property or money, then&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) gain (if any) to such recipient shall be recognized, but not in excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of money received, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the fair market value of such other property received; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule for section 355</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the requirements of section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) are met with respect to a distribution described in paragraph (1), then, solely for purposes of determining the tax treatment of the transfers of property to the controlled corporation by the distributing corporation, the fact that the shareholders of the distributing corporation dispose of part or all of the distributed stock, or the fact that the corporation whose stock was distributed issues additional stock, shall not be taken into account in determining control for purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Services, certain indebtedness, and accrued interest not treated as property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, stock issued for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) services,</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Transfer of property to an investment company</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A transfer of property to an investment company. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the determination of whether a company is an investment company shall be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by taking into account all stock and securities held by the company, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(viii) any other asset specified in regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Secretary may prescribe regulations that, under appropriate circumstances, treat any asset described in clauses (i) through (v) as not so listed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Title 11 or similar case</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A transfer of property of a debtor pursuant to a plan while the debtor is under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or similar case (within the meaning of section 368(a)(3)(A)), to the extent that the stock received in the exchange is used to satisfy the indebtedness of such debtor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Treatment of controlled corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) property is transferred to a corporation (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;controlled corporation&rdquo;) in an exchange with respect to which gain or loss is not recognized (in whole or in part) to the transferor under this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such exchange is not in pursuance of a plan of reorganization,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">section 311 shall apply to any transfer in such exchange by the controlled corporation in the same manner as if such transfer were a distribution to which subpart A of part I applies.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:961 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Nonqualified preferred stock not treated as stock</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a person who transfers property to a corporation and receives nonqualified preferred stock&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) subsection (a) shall not apply to such transferor, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if (and only if) the transferor receives stock other than nonqualified preferred stock&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) subsection (b) shall apply to such transferor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such nonqualified preferred stock shall be treated as other property for purposes of applying subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Nonqualified preferred stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;nonqualified preferred stock&rdquo; means preferred stock if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the holder of such stock has the right to require the issuer or a related person to redeem or purchase the stock,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the issuer or a related person is required to redeem or purchase such stock,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the issuer or a related person has the right to redeem or purchase the stock and, as of the issue date, it is more likely than not that such right will be exercised, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the dividend rate on such stock varies in whole or in part (directly or indirectly) with reference to interest rates, commodity prices, or other similar indices.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph (A) shall apply only if the right or obligation referred to therein may be exercised within the 20-year period beginning on the issue date of such stock and such right or obligation is not subject to a contingency which, as of the issue date, makes remote the likelihood of the redemption or purchase.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Exceptions for certain rights or obligations</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A right or obligation shall not be treated as described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of subparagraph (A) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) it may be exercised only upon the death, disability, or mental incompetency of the holder, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) in the case of a right or obligation to redeem or purchase stock transferred in connection with the performance of services for the issuer or a related person (and which represents reasonable compensation), it may be exercised only upon the holder's separation from service from the issuer or a related person.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Clause (i)(I) shall not apply if the stock relinquished in the exchange, or the stock acquired in the exchange is in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) a corporation if any class of stock in such corporation or a related party is readily tradable on an established securities market or otherwise, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) any other corporation if such exchange is part of a transaction or series of transactions in which such corporation is to become a corporation described in subclause (I).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Preferred stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;preferred stock&rdquo; means stock which is limited and preferred as to dividends and does not participate in corporate growth to any significant extent. Stock shall not be treated as participating in corporate growth to any significant extent unless there is a real and meaningful likelihood of the shareholder actually participating in the earnings and growth of the corporation. If there is not a real and meaningful likelihood that dividends beyond any limitation or preference will actually be paid, the possibility of such payments will be disregarded in determining whether stock is limited and preferred as to dividends.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Related person</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A person shall be treated as related to another person if they bear a relationship to such other person described in section 267(b) or 707(b).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this subsection and sections 354(a)(2)(C), 355(a)(3)(D), and 356(e). The Secretary may also prescribe regulations, consistent with the treatment under this subsection and such sections, for the treatment of nonqualified preferred stock under other provisions of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Gain on exchanges</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Recognition of gain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) section 354 or 355 would apply to an exchange but for the fact that</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the property received in the exchange consists not only of property permitted by section 354 or 355 to be received without the <!-- PDFPage:973 -->recognition of gain but also of other property or money,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then the gain, if any, to the recipient shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the sum of such money and the fair market value of such other property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment as dividend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an exchange is described in paragraph (1) but has the effect of the distribution of a dividend (determined with the application of section 318(a)), then there shall be treated as a dividend to each distributee such an amount of the gain recognized under paragraph (1) as is not in excess of his ratable share of the undistributed earnings and profits of the corporation accumulated after February 28, 1913. The remainder, if any, of the gain recognized under paragraph (1) shall be treated as gain from the exchange of property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional consideration received in certain distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) section 355 would apply to a distribution but for the fact that</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the property received in the distribution consists not only of property permitted by section 355 to be received without the recognition of gain, but also of other property or money,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then an amount equal to the sum of such money and the fair market value of such other property shall be treated as a distribution of property to which section 301 applies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) section 354 would apply to an exchange or section 355 would apply to an exchange or distribution, but for the fact that</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the property received in the exchange or distribution consists not only of property permitted by section 354 or 355 to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, but also of other property or money,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then no loss from the exchange or distribution shall be recognized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Securities as other property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the term &ldquo;other property&rdquo; includes securities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Securities with respect to which nonrecognition of gain would be permitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;other property&rdquo; does not include securities to the extent that, under section 354 or 355, such securities would be permitted to be received without the recognition of gain.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Greater principal amount in section 354 exchange</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in an exchange described in section 354 (other than subsection (c) thereof), securities of a corporation a party to the reorganization are surrendered and securities of any corporation a party to the reorganization are received, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the principal amount of such securities received exceeds the principal amount of such securities surrendered,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then, with respect to such securities received, the term &ldquo;other property&rdquo; means only the fair market value of such excess. For purposes of this subparagraph and subparagraph (C) if no securities are surrendered, the excess shall be the entire principal amount of the securities received.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Greater principal amount in section 355 transaction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, in an exchange or distribution described in section 355, the principal amount of the securities in the controlled corporation which are received exceeds the principal amount of the securities in the distributing corporation which are surrendered, then, with respect to such securities received, the term &ldquo;other property&rdquo; means only the fair market value of such excess.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Nonqualified preferred stock treated as other property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;other property&rdquo; does not include nonqualified preferred stock (as so defined) to the extent that, under section 354 or 355, such preferred stock would be permitted to be received without the recognition of gain.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Exchanges for section 306 stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, to the extent that any of the other property (or money) is received in exchange for section 306 stock, an amount equal to the fair market value of such other property (or the amount of such money) shall be treated as a distribution of property to which section 301 applies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Transactions involving gift or compensation</h4>
<p class="note-body-1em"><strong>For special rules for a transaction described in section 354, 355, or this section, but which&mdash;</strong></p>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>(1) results in a gift, see section 2501 and following, or</strong></p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;357. Assumption of liability</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the taxpayer receives property which would be permitted to be received under section 351 or 361 without the recognition of gain if it were the sole consideration, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as part of the consideration, another party to the exchange assumes a liability of the taxpayer,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then such assumption shall not be treated as money or other property, and shall not prevent the exchange from being within the provisions of section 351 or 361, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Tax avoidance purpose</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, taking into consideration the nature of the liability and the circumstances in the light of which the arrangement for the assumption was made, it appears that the principal purpose of the taxpayer with respect to the assumption described in subsection (a)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) was a purpose to avoid Federal income tax on the exchange, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if not such purpose, was not a bona fide business purpose,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then such assumption (in the total amount of the liability assumed pursuant to such exchange) shall, for purposes of section 351 or 361 (as the case may be), be considered as money received by the taxpayer on the exchange.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any suit or proceeding where the burden is on the taxpayer to prove such assumption is not to be treated as money received by the taxpayer, such burden shall not be considered as sustained unless the taxpayer sustains such burden by the clear preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Liabilities in excess of basis</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an exchange&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to which section 351 applies, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to which section 361 applies by reason of a plan of reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(D) with respect to which stock or securities of the corporation to which the assets are transferred are distributed in a transaction which qualifies under section 355,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">if the sum of the amount of the liabilities assumed exceeds the total of the adjusted basis of the property transferred pursuant to such exchange, then such excess shall be considered as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or of property which is not a capital asset, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any exchange&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to which subsection (b)(1) of this section applies, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which is pursuant to a plan of reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(G) where no former shareholder of the transferor corporation receives any consideration for his stock.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certain liabilities excluded</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a taxpayer transfers, in an exchange to which section 351 applies, a liability the payment of which either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) would give rise to a deduction, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) would be described in section 736(a),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then, for purposes of paragraph (1), the amount of such liability shall be excluded in determining the amount of liabilities assumed.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any liability to the extent that the incurrence of the liability resulted in the creation of, or an increase in, the basis of any property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of amount of liability assumed</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, section 358(d), section 358(h), section 361(b)(3), section 362(d), section 368(a)(1)(C), and section 368(a)(2)(B), except as provided in regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a recourse liability (or portion thereof) shall be treated as having been assumed if, as determined on the basis of all facts and circumstances, the transferee has agreed to, and is expected to, satisfy such liability (or portion), whether or not the transferor has been relieved of such liability; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) except to the extent provided in paragraph (2), a nonrecourse liability shall be treated as having been assumed by the transferee of any asset subject to such liability.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception for nonrecourse liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the nonrecourse liability treated as described in paragraph (1)(B) shall be reduced by the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of such liability which an owner of other assets not transferred to the transferee and also subject to such liability <!-- PDFPage:975 -->has agreed with the transferee to, and is expected to, satisfy; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the fair market value of such other assets (determined without regard to section 7701(g)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection and section 362(d). The Secretary may also prescribe regulations which provide that the manner in which a liability is treated as assumed under this subsection is applied, where appropriate, elsewhere in this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an exchange to which section 351, 354, 355, 356, or 361 applies&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Nonrecognition property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The basis of the property permitted to be received under such section without the recognition of gain or loss shall be the same as that of the property exchanged&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) decreased by&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:976 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the fair market value of any other property (except money) received by the taxpayer,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of any money received by the taxpayer, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the amount of loss to the taxpayer which was recognized on such exchange, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) increased by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount which was treated as a dividend, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of gain to the taxpayer which was recognized on such exchange (not including any portion of such gain which was treated as a dividend).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The basis of any other property (except money) received by the taxpayer shall be its fair market value.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allocation of basis</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the basis determined under subsection (a)(1) shall be allocated among the properties permitted to be received without the recognition of gain or loss.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule for section 355</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an exchange to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies, then in making the allocation under paragraph (1) of this subsection, there shall be taken into account not only the property so permitted to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, but also the stock or securities (if any) of the distributing corporation which are retained, and the allocation of basis shall be made among all such properties.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Section 355 transactions which are not exchanges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, a distribution to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies shall be treated as an exchange, and for such purposes the stock and securities of the distributing corporation which are retained shall be treated as surrendered, and received back, in the exchange.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assumption of liability</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where, as part of the consideration to the taxpayer, another party to the exchange assumed a liability of the taxpayer, such assumption shall, for purposes of this section, be treated as money received by the taxpayer on the exchange.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the amount of any liability excluded under section 357(c)(3).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not apply to property acquired by a corporation by the exchange of its stock or securities (or the stock or securities of a corporation which is in control of the acquiring corporation) as consideration in whole or in part for the transfer of the property to it.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definition of nonrecognition property in case of section 361 exchange</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the property permitted to be received under section 361 without the recognition of gain or loss shall be treated as consisting only of stock or securities in another corporation a party to the reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Adjustments in intragroup transactions involving section 355</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a distribution to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies and which involves the distribution of stock from 1 member of an affiliated group (as defined in section 1504(a) without regard to subsection (b) thereof) to another member of such group, the Secretary may, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, provide adjustments to the adjusted basis of any stock which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is in a corporation which is a member of such group, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is held by another member of such group,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">to appropriately reflect the proper treatment of such distribution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Special rules for assumption of liabilities to which subsection (d) does not apply</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, after application of the other provisions of this section to an exchange or series of exchanges, the basis of property to which subsection (a)(1) applies exceeds the fair market value of such property, then such basis shall be reduced (but not below such fair market value) by the amount (determined as of the date of the exchange) of any liability&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which is assumed by another person as part of the exchange, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with respect to which subsection (d)(1) does not apply to the assumption.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided by the Secretary, paragraph (1) shall not apply to any liability if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the trade or business with which the liability is associated is transferred to the person assuming the liability as part of the exchange, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) substantially all of the assets with which the liability is associated are transferred to the person assuming the liability as part of the exchange.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;liability&rdquo; shall include any fixed or contingent obligation to make payment, without regard to whether the obligation is otherwise taken into account for purposes of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No gain or loss shall be recognized to a corporation if such corporation is a party to a reorganization and exchanges property, in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, solely for stock or securities in another corporation a party to the reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exchanges not solely in kind</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Gain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If subsection (a) would apply to an exchange but for the fact that the property received in exchange consists not only of stock or securities permitted by subsection (a) to be received without the recognition of gain, but also of other property or money, then&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Property distributed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the corporation receiving such other property or money distributes it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, no gain to the corporation shall be recognized from the exchange, but</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Property not distributed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the corporation receiving such other property or money does not distribute it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, the gain, if any, to the corporation shall be recognized.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The amount of gain recognized under subparagraph (B) shall not exceed the sum of the money and the fair market value of the other property so received which is not so distributed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If subsection (a) would apply to an exchange but for the fact that the property received in exchange consists not only of property permitted by subsection (a) to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, but also of other property or money, then no loss from the exchange shall be recognized.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of transfers to creditors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), any transfer of the other property or money received in the exchange by the corporation to its creditors in connection with the reorganization shall be treated as a distribution in pursuance of the plan of reorganization. The Secretary may prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to prevent avoidance of tax through abuse of the preceding sentence or subsection (c)(3). In the case of a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D) with respect to which stock or securities of the corporation to which the assets are transferred are distributed in a transaction which qualifies under section 355, this paragraph shall apply only to the extent that the sum of the money and the fair market value of other property transferred to such creditors does not exceed the adjusted bases of such assets transferred (reduced by the amount of the liabilities assumed (within the meaning of section 357(c))).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Treatment of distributions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), no gain or loss shall be recognized to a corporation a party to a reorganization on the distribution to its shareholders of property in pursuance of the plan of reorganization.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in a distribution referred to in paragraph (1), the corporation distributes property other than qualified property, and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then gain shall be recognized to the distributing corporation as if such property were sold to the distributee at its fair market value.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Qualified property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;qualified property&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any stock in (or right to acquire stock in) the distributing corporation or obligation of the distributing corporation, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any stock in (or right to acquire stock in) another corporation which is a party to the reorganization or obligation of another corporation which is such a party if such stock (or right) or obligation is received by the distributing corporation in the exchange.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Treatment of liabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If any property distributed in the distribution referred to in paragraph (1) is subject to a liability or the shareholder assumes a liability of the distributing corporation in connection with the distribution, then, for purposes of subparagraph (A), the fair market value of such property shall be treated as not less than the amount of such liability.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of certain transfers to creditors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, any transfer of qualified property by the corporation to its creditors in connection with the reorganization shall be treated as a distribution to its shareholders pursuant to the plan of reorganization.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Property acquired by issuance of stock or as paid-in surplus</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If property was acquired on or after June 22, 1954, by a corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in connection with a transaction to which section 351 (relating to transfer of property to corporation controlled by transferor) applies, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as paid-in surplus or as a contribution to capital,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the basis shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor, increased in the amount of gain recognized to the transferor on such transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Transfers to corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If property was acquired by a corporation in connection with a reorganization to which this part applies, then the basis shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor, increased in the amount of gain recognized to the transferor on such transfer. This subsection shall not apply if the property acquired consists of stock or securities in a corporation a party to the reorganization, unless acquired by the exchange of stock or securities of the transferee (or of a corporation which is in control of the transferee) as the consideration in whole or in part for the transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rule for certain contributions to capital</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Property other than money</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2), if property other than money&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is acquired by a corporation, on or after June 22, 1954, as a contribution to capital, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is not contributed by a shareholder as such,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then the basis of such property shall be zero.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Money</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2), if money&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is received by a corporation, on or after June 22, 1954, as a contribution to capital, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is not contributed by a shareholder as such,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then the basis of any property acquired with such money during the 12-month period beginning on the day the contribution is received shall be reduced by the amount of such contribution. The excess (if any) of the amount of <!-- PDFPage:980 -->such contribution over the amount of the reduction under the preceding sentence shall be applied to the reduction (as of the last day of the period specified in the preceding sentence) of the basis of any other property held by the taxpayer. The particular properties to which the reductions required by this paragraph shall be allocated shall be determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on basis increase attributable to assumption of liability</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In no event shall the basis of any property be increased under subsection (a) or (b) above the fair market value of such property (determined without regard to section 7701(g)) by reason of any gain recognized to the transferor as a result of the assumption of a liability.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of gain not subject to tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in regulations, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) gain is recognized to the transferor as a result of an assumption of a nonrecourse liability by a transferee which is also secured by assets not transferred to such transferee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) no person is subject to tax under this title on such gain,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then, for purposes of determining basis under subsections (a) and (b), the amount of gain recognized by the transferor as a result of the assumption of the liability shall be determined as if the liability assumed by the transferee equaled such transferee's ratable portion of such liability determined on the basis of the relative fair market values (determined without regard to section 7701(g)) of all of the assets subject to such liability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitations on built-in losses</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitation on importation of built-in losses</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If in any transaction described in subsection (a) or (b) there would (but for this subsection) be an importation of a net built-in loss, the basis of each property described in subparagraph (B) which is acquired in such transaction shall (notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b)) be its fair market value immediately after such transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Property described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), property is described in this subparagraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) gain or loss with respect to such property is not subject to tax under this subtitle in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) gain or loss with respect to such property is subject to such tax in the hands of the transferee immediately after such transfer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In any case in which the transferor is a partnership, the preceding sentence shall be applied by treating each partner in such partnership as holding such partner's proportionate share of the property of such partnership.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Importation of net built-in loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), there is an importation of a net built-in loss in a transaction if the transferee's aggregate adjusted bases of property described in subparagraph (B) which is transferred in such transaction would (but for this paragraph) exceed the fair market value of such property immediately after such transaction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation on transfer of built-in losses in section 351 transactions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) property is transferred by a transferor in any transaction which is described in subsection (a) and which is not described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the transferee's aggregate adjusted bases of such property so transferred would (but for this paragraph) exceed the fair market value of such property immediately after such transaction,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then, notwithstanding subsection (a), the transferee's aggregate adjusted bases of the property so transferred shall not exceed the fair market value of such property immediately after such transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Allocation of basis reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The aggregate reduction in basis by reason of subparagraph (A) shall be allocated among the property so transferred in proportion to their respective built-in losses immediately before the transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Election to apply limitation to transferor's stock basis</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the transferor and transferee of a transaction described in subparagraph (A) both elect the application of this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) subparagraph (A) shall not apply, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the transferor's basis in the stock received for property to which subparagraph (A) does not apply by reason of the election shall not exceed its fair market value immediately after the transfer.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Election</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the acquisition by one corporation, in exchange solely for all or a part of its voting stock (or in exchange solely for all or a part of the voting stock of a corporation which is in control of the acquiring corporation), of stock of another corporation if, immediately after the acquisition, the acquiring corporation has control of such other corporation (whether or not such acquiring corporation had control immediately before the acquisition);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the acquisition by one corporation, in exchange solely for all or a part of its voting stock (or in exchange solely for all or a part of the voting stock of a corporation which is in control of the acquiring corporation), of substantially all of the properties of another corporation, but in determining whether the exchange is solely for stock the assumption by the acquiring corporation of a liability of the other shall be disregarded;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a transfer by a corporation of all or a part of its assets to another corporation if immediately after the transfer the transferor, or one or more of its shareholders (including persons who were shareholders immediately before the transfer), or any combination thereof, is in control of the corporation to which the assets are transferred; but only if, in pursuance of the plan, stock or securities of the corporation to which the assets are transferred are distributed in a transaction which qualifies under section 354, 355, or 356;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional consideration in certain paragraph (1)(C) cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) one corporation acquires substantially all of the properties of another corporation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the acquisition would qualify under paragraph (1)(C) but for the fact that the acquiring corporation exchanges money or other property in addition to voting stock, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the acquiring corporation acquires, solely for voting stock described in paragraph (1)(C), property of the other corporation having a fair market value which is at least 80 percent of the fair market value of all of the property of the other corporation,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then such acquisition shall (subject to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph) be treated as qualifying under paragraph (1)(C).

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Transfers of assets or stock to subsidiaries in certain paragraph (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(C), and (1)(G) cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A transaction otherwise qualifying under paragraph (1)(A), (1)(B), or (1)(C) shall not be disqualified by reason of the fact that part or all of the assets or stock which were acquired in the transaction are transferred to a corporation controlled by the corporation acquiring such assets or stock. A similar rule shall apply to a transaction otherwise qualifying under paragraph (1)(G) where the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 354(b)(1) are met with respect to the acquisition of the assets.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Use of stock of controlling corporation in paragraph (1)(A) and (1)(G) cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The acquisition by one corporation, in exchange for stock of a corporation (referred to in this subparagraph as &ldquo;controlling corporation&rdquo;) which is in control of the acquiring corporation, of substantially all of the properties of another corporation shall not disqualify a transaction under paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(G) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) no stock of the acquiring corporation is used in the transaction, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a transaction under paragraph (1)(A), such transaction would have qualified under paragraph (1)(A) had the merger been into the controlling corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Statutory merger using voting stock of corporation controlling merged corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A transaction otherwise qualifying under paragraph (1)(A) shall not be disqualified by reason of the fact that stock of a corporation (referred to in this subparagraph as the &ldquo;controlling corporation&rdquo;) which before the merger was in control of the merged corporation is used in the transaction, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) after the transaction, the corporation surviving the merger holds substantially all of its properties and of the properties of the merged corporation (other than stock of the controlling corporation distributed in the transaction); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the transaction, former shareholders of the surviving corporation exchanged, for an amount of voting stock of <!-- PDFPage:986 -->the controlling corporation, an amount of stock in the surviving corporation which constitutes control of such corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Certain transactions involving 2 or more investment companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) If immediately before a transaction described in paragraph (1) (other than subparagraph (E) thereof), 2 or more parties to the transaction were investment companies, then the transaction shall not be considered to be a reorganization with respect to any such investment company (and its shareholders and security holders) unless it was a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, or a corporation which meets the requirements of clause (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) A corporation meets the requirements of this clause if not more than 25 percent of the value of its total assets is invested in the stock and securities of any one issuer, and not more than 50 percent of the value of its total assets is invested in the stock and securities of 5 or fewer issuers. For purposes of this clause, all members of a controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1563(a)) shall be treated as one issuer. For purposes of this clause, a person holding stock in a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, or an investment company which meets the requirements of this clause shall, except as provided in regulations, be treated as holding its proportionate share of the assets held by such company or trust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) For purposes of this subparagraph the term &ldquo;investment company&rdquo; means a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, or a corporation 50 percent or more of the value of whose total assets are stock and securities and 80 percent or more of the value of whose total assets are assets held for investment. In making the 50-percent and 80-percent determinations under the preceding sentence, stock and securities in any subsidiary corporation shall be disregarded and the parent corporation shall be deemed to own its ratable share of the subsidiary's assets, and a corporation shall be considered a subsidiary if the parent owns 50 percent or more of the combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or 50 percent or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock outstanding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) For purposes of this subparagraph, in determining total assets there shall be excluded cash and cash items (including receivables). Government securities, and, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, assets acquired (through incurring indebtedness or otherwise) for purposes of meeting the requirements of clause (ii) or ceasing to be an investment company.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) This subparagraph shall not apply if the stock of each investment company is owned substantially by the same persons in the same proportions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) If an investment company which does not meet the requirements of clause (ii) acquires assets of another corporation, clause (i) shall be applied to such investment company and its shareholders and security holders as though its assets had been acquired by such other corporation. If such investment company acquires stock of another corporation in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B), clause (i) shall be applied to the shareholders of such investment company as though they had exchanged with such other corporation all of their stock in such company for stock having a fair market value equal to the fair market value of their stock of such investment company immediately after the exchange. For purposes of section 1001, the deemed acquisition or exchange referred to in the two preceding sentences shall be treated as a sale or exchange of property by the corporation and by the shareholders and security holders to which clause (i) is applied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) For purposes of clauses (ii) and (iii), the term &ldquo;securities&rdquo; includes obligations of State and local governments, commodity futures contracts, shares of regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts, and other investments constituting a security within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;2(36)).<sup><a href="#368_1_target" name="368_1">1</a></sup></p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Distribution requirement for paragraph (1)(C)</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A transaction shall fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(C) unless the acquired corporation distributes the stock, securities, and other properties it receives, as well as its other properties, in pursuance of the plan of reorganization. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if the acquired corporation is liquidated pursuant to the plan of reorganization, any distribution to its creditors in connection with such liquidation shall be treated as pursuant to the plan of reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary may waive the application of clause (i) to any transaction subject to any conditions the Secretary may prescribe.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In applying paragraph (1)(G), a transfer of the assets of a corporation shall be treated as made in a title 11 or similar case if and only if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) no former shareholder of the surviving corporation received any consideration for his stock, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the former creditors of the surviving corporation exchanged, for an amount of voting stock of the controlling corporation, debt of the surviving corporation which had a fair market value equal to 80 percent or more of the total fair market value of the debt of the surviving corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Party to a reorganization</h4>
