<p class="statutory-body">A partner's distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit shall, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, be determined by the partnership agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of distributive share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A partner's distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit (or item thereof) shall be determined in accordance with the partner's interest in the partnership (determined by taking into account all facts and circumstances), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the partnership agreement does not provide as to the partner's distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit (or item thereof), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the allocation to a partner under the agreement of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit (or item thereof) does not have substantial economic effect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contributed property</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) income, gain, loss, and deduction with respect to property contributed to the partnership by a partner shall be shared among the partners so as to take account of the variation between the basis of the property to the partnership and its fair market value at the time of contribution, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if any property so contributed is distributed (directly or indirectly) by the partnership (other than to the contributing partner) within 7 years of being contributed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the contributing partner shall be treated as recognizing gain or loss (as the case may be) from the sale of such property in an amount equal to the gain or loss which would have been allocated to such partner under subparagraph (A) by reason of the variation described in subparagraph (A) if the property had been sold at its fair market value at the time of the distribution,</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1271 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the character of such gain or loss shall be determined by reference to the character of the gain or loss which would have resulted if such property had been sold by the partnership to the distributee, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) appropriate adjustments shall be made to the adjusted basis of the contributing partner's interest in the partnership and to the adjusted basis of the property distributed to reflect any gain or loss recognized under this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule for distributions where gain or loss would not be recognized outside partnerships</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) property contributed by a partner (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;contributing partner&rdquo;) is distributed by the partnership to another partner, and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then to the extent of the value of the property described in subparagraph (B), paragraph (1)(B) shall be applied as if the contributing partner had contributed to the partnership the property described in subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Other rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, rules similar to the rules of paragraph (1) shall apply to contributions by a partner (using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting) of accounts payable and other accrued but unpaid items. Any reference in paragraph (1) or (2) to the contributing partner shall be treated as including a reference to any successor of such partner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on allowance of losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A partner's distributive share of partnership loss (including capital loss) shall be allowed only to the extent of the adjusted basis of such partner's interest in the partnership at the end of the partnership year in which such loss occurred. Any excess of such loss over such basis shall be allowed as a deduction at the end of the partnership year in which such excess is repaid to the partnership.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Family partnerships</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Recognition of interest created by purchase or gift</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person shall be recognized as a partner for purposes of this subtitle if he owns a capital interest in a partnership in which capital is a material income-producing factor, whether or not such interest was derived by purchase or gift from any other person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Distributive share of donee includible in gross income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any partnership interest created by gift, the distributive share of the donee under the partnership agreement shall be includible in his gross income, except to the extent that such share is determined without allowance of reasonable compensation for services rendered to the partnership by the donor, and except to the extent that the portion of such share attributable to donated capital is proportionately greater than the share of the donor attributable to the donor's capital. The distributive share of a partner in the earnings of the partnership shall not be diminished because of absence due to military service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Purchase of interest by member of family</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, an interest purchased by one member of a family from another shall be considered to be created by gift from the seller, and the fair market value of the purchased interest shall be considered to be donated capital. The &ldquo;family&rdquo; of any individual shall include only his spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants, and any trusts for the primary benefit of such persons.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Distributions other than in liquidation of a partner's interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The basis of property (other than money) distributed by a partnership to a partner other than in liquidation of the partner's interest shall, except as provided in paragraph (2), be its adjusted basis to the partnership immediately before such distribution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The basis to the distributee partner of property to which paragraph (1) is applicable shall not exceed the adjusted basis of such partner's interest in the partnership reduced by any money distributed in the same transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Distributions in liquidation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The basis of property (other than money) distributed by a partnership to a partner in liquidation of the partner's interest shall be an amount equal to the adjusted basis of such partner's interest in the partnership reduced by any money distributed in the same transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocation of basis</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The basis of distributed properties to which subsection (a)(2) or (b) is applicable shall be allocated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) first to any unrealized receivables (as defined in section 751(c)) and inventory items (as defined in section 751(d)) in an amount equal to the adjusted basis of each such property to the partnership, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if the basis to be allocated is less than the sum of the adjusted bases of such properties to the partnership, then, to the extent any decrease is required in order to have the adjusted bases of such properties equal the basis to be allocated, in the manner provided in paragraph (3), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to the extent of any basis remaining after the allocation under subparagraph (A), to other distributed properties&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) first by assigning to each such other property such other property's adjusted basis to the partnership, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) then, to the extent any increase or decrease in basis is required in order to have the adjusted bases of such other distributed properties equal such remaining basis, in the manner provided in paragraph (2) or (3), whichever is appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Method of allocating increase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any increase required under paragraph (1)(B) shall be allocated among the properties&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) first to properties with unrealized appreciation in proportion to their respective amounts of unrealized appreciation before such increase (but only to the extent of each property's unrealized appreciation), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) then, to the extent such increase is not allocated under subparagraph (A), in proportion to their respective fair market values.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Method of allocating decrease</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any decrease required under paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B) shall be allocated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) first to properties with unrealized depreciation in proportion to their respective amounts of unrealized depreciation before such decrease (but only to the extent of each property's unrealized depreciation), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) then, to the extent such decrease is not allocated under subparagraph (A), in proportion to their respective adjusted bases (as adjusted under subparagraph (A)).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special partnership basis to transferee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsections (a), (b), and (c), a partner who acquired all or a part of his interest by a transfer with respect to which the election provided in section 754 is not in effect, and to whom a distribution of property (other than money) is made with respect to the transferred interest within 2 years after such transfer, may elect, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to treat as the adjusted partnership basis of such property the adjusted basis such property would have if the adjustment provided in section 743(b) were in effect with respect to the partnership property. The Secretary may by regulations require the application of this subsection in the case of a distribution to a transferee partner, whether or not made within 2 years after the transfer, if at the time of the transfer the fair market value of the partnership property (other than money) exceeded 110 percent of its adjusted basis to the partnership.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exception</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any distribution by a partnership to a partner, such partner shall be treated as recognizing gain in an amount equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Gain recognized under the preceding sentence shall be in addition to any gain recognized under section 731. The character of such gain shall be determined by reference to the proportionate character of the net precontribution gain.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Basis rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Partner's interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The adjusted basis of a partner's interest in a partnership shall be increased by the amount of any gain recognized by such partner under subsection (a).

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any portion of the property distributed consists of property which had been contributed by the distributee partner to the partnership, such property shall not be taken into account under subsection (a)(1) and shall not be taken into account in determining the amount of the net precontribution gain. If the property distributed consists of an interest in an entity, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent that the value of such interest is attributable to property contributed to such entity after such interest had been contributed to the partnership.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Coordination with section 751</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The basis of partnership property shall not be adjusted as the result of a transfer of an interest in a partnership by sale or exchange or on the death of a partner unless the election provided by section 754 (relating to optional adjustment to basis of partnership property) is in effect with respect to such partnership.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustment to basis of partnership property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a transfer of an interest in a partnership by sale or exchange or upon the death of a partner, a partnership with respect to which the election provided in section 754 is in effect shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) increase the adjusted basis of the partnership property by the excess of the basis to the transferee partner of his interest in the partnership over his proportionate share of the adjusted basis of the partnership property, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) decrease the adjusted basis of the partnership property by the excess of the transferee partner's proportionate share of the adjusted basis of the partnership property over the basis of his interest in the partnership.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, such increase or decrease shall constitute an adjustment to the basis of partnership property with respect to the transferee partner only. A partner's proportionate share of the adjusted basis of partnership property shall be determined in accordance with his interest in partnership capital and, in the case of property contributed to the partnership by a partner, section 704(c) (relating to contributed property) shall apply in determining such share. In the case of an adjustment under this subsection to the basis of partnership property subject to depletion, any depletion allowable shall be determined separately for the transferee partner with respect to his interest in such property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocation of basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The allocation of basis among partnership properties where subsection (b) is applicable shall be made in accordance with the rules provided in section 755.</p>
