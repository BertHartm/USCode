<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Effect of partnership agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A partner's distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit shall, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, be determined by the partnership agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of distributive share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A partner's distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit (or item thereof) shall be determined in accordance with the partner's interest in the partnership (determined by taking into account all facts and circumstances), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the partnership agreement does not provide as to the partner's distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit (or item thereof), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the allocation to a partner under the agreement of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit (or item thereof) does not have substantial economic effect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contributed property</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) income, gain, loss, and deduction with respect to property contributed to the partnership by a partner shall be shared among the partners so as to take account of the variation between the basis of the property to the partnership and its fair market value at the time of contribution,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if any property so contributed is distributed (directly or indirectly) by the partnership (other than to the contributing partner) within 7 years of being contributed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the contributing partner shall be treated as recognizing gain or loss (as the case may be) from the sale of such property in an amount equal to the gain or loss which would have been allocated to such partner under subparagraph (A) by reason of the variation described in subparagraph (A) if the property had been sold at its fair market value at the time of the distribution,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the character of such gain or loss shall be determined by reference to the character of the gain or loss which would have resulted if such property had been sold by the partnership to the distributee, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) appropriate adjustments shall be made to the adjusted basis of the contributing partner's interest in the partnership and to the adjusted basis of the property distributed to reflect any gain or loss recognized under this subparagraph, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if any property so contributed has a built-in loss&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such built-in loss shall be taken into account only in determining the amount of items allocated to the contributing partner, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) except as provided in regulations, in determining the amount of items allocated to other partners, the basis of the contributed property in the hands of the partnership shall be treated as being equal to its fair market value at the time of contribution.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (C), the term &ldquo;built-in loss&rdquo; means the excess of the adjusted basis of the property (determined without regard to subparagraph (C)(ii)) over its fair market value at the time of contribution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule for distributions where gain or loss would not be recognized outside partnerships</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) property contributed by a partner (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;contributing partner&rdquo;) is distributed by the partnership to another partner, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) other property of a like kind (within the meaning of section 1031) is distributed by the partnership to the contributing partner not later than the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the 180th day after the date of the distribution described in subparagraph (A), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the due date (determined with regard to extensions) for the contributing partner's return of the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the distribution described in subparagraph (A) occurs,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then to the extent of the value of the property described in subparagraph (B), paragraph (1)(B) shall be applied as if the contributing partner had contributed to the partnership the property described in subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Other rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, rules similar to the rules of paragraph (1) shall apply to contributions by a partner (using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting) of accounts payable and other accrued but unpaid items. Any reference in paragraph (1) or (2) to the contributing partner shall be treated as including a reference to any successor of such partner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on allowance of losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A partner's distributive share of partnership loss (including capital loss) shall be allowed only to the extent of the adjusted basis of such <!-- PDFPage:1648 -->partner's interest in the partnership at the end of the partnership year in which such loss occurred. Any excess of such loss over such basis shall be allowed as a deduction at the end of the partnership year in which such excess is repaid to the partnership.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Family partnerships</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Recognition of interest created by purchase or gift</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person shall be recognized as a partner for purposes of this subtitle if he owns a capital interest in a partnership in which capital is a material income-producing factor, whether or not such interest was derived by purchase or gift from any other person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Distributive share of donee includible in gross income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any partnership interest created by gift, the distributive share of the donee under the partnership agreement shall be includible in his gross income, except to the extent that such share is determined without allowance of reasonable compensation for services rendered to the partnership by the donor, and except to the extent that the portion of such share attributable to donated capital is proportionately greater than the share of the donor attributable to the donor's capital. The distributive share of a partner in the earnings of the partnership shall not be diminished because of absence due to military service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Purchase of interest by member of family</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, an interest purchased by one member of a family from another shall be considered to be created by gift from the seller, and the fair market value of the purchased interest shall be considered to be donated capital. The &ldquo;family&rdquo; of any individual shall include only his spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants, and any trusts for the primary benefit of such persons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Cross reference</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Guaranteed payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent determined without regard to the income of the partnership, payments to a partner for services or the use of capital shall be considered as made to one who is not a member of the partnership, but only for the purposes of section 61(a) (relating to gross income) and, subject to section 263, for purposes of section 162(a) (relating to trade or business expenses).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Distributions other than in liquidation of a partner's interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The basis of property (other than money) distributed by a partnership to a partner other than in liquidation of the partner's interest shall, except as provided in paragraph (2), be its adjusted basis to the partnership immediately before such distribution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The basis to the distributee partner of property to which paragraph (1) is applicable shall not exceed the adjusted basis of such partner's interest in the partnership reduced by any money distributed in the same transaction.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1660 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Distributions in liquidation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The basis of property (other than money) distributed by a partnership to a partner in liquidation of the partner's interest shall be an amount equal to the adjusted basis of such partner's interest in the partnership reduced by any money distributed in the same transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocation of basis</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The basis of distributed properties to which subsection (a)(2) or (b) is applicable shall be allocated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) first to any unrealized receivables (as defined in section 751(c)) and inventory items (as defined in section 751(d)) in an amount equal to the adjusted basis of each such property to the partnership, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if the basis to be allocated is less than the sum of the adjusted bases of such properties to the partnership, then, to the extent any decrease is required in order to have the adjusted bases of such properties equal the basis to be allocated, in the manner provided in paragraph (3), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to the extent of any basis remaining after the allocation under subparagraph (A), to other distributed properties&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) first by assigning to each such other property such other property's adjusted basis to the partnership, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) then, to the extent any increase or decrease in basis is required in order to have the adjusted bases of such other distributed properties equal such remaining basis, in the manner provided in paragraph (2) or (3), whichever is appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Method of allocating increase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any increase required under paragraph (1)(B) shall be allocated among the properties&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) first to properties with unrealized appreciation in proportion to their respective amounts of unrealized appreciation before such increase (but only to the extent of each property's unrealized appreciation), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) then, to the extent such increase is not allocated under subparagraph (A), in proportion to their respective fair market values.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Method of allocating decrease</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any decrease required under paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B) shall be allocated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) first to properties with unrealized depreciation in proportion to their respective amounts of unrealized depreciation before such decrease (but only to the extent of each property's unrealized depreciation), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) then, to the extent such decrease is not allocated under subparagraph (A), in proportion to their respective adjusted bases (as adjusted under subparagraph (A)).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special partnership basis to transferee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsections (a), (b), and (c), a partner who acquired all or a part of his interest by a transfer with respect to which the election provided in section 754 is not in effect, and to whom a distribution of property (other than money) is made with respect to the transferred interest within 2 years after such transfer, may elect, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to treat as the adjusted partnership basis of such property the adjusted basis such property would have if the adjustment provided in section 743(b) were in effect with respect to the partnership property. The Secretary may by regulations require the application of this subsection in the case of a distribution to a transferee partner, whether or not made within 2 years after the transfer, if at the time of the transfer the fair market value of the partnership property (other than money) exceeded 110 percent of its adjusted basis to the partnership.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not apply to the extent that a distribution is treated as a sale or exchange of property under section 751(b) (relating to unrealized receivables and inventory items).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Corresponding adjustment to basis of assets of a distributed corporation controlled by a corporate partner</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a corporation (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;corporate partner&rdquo;) receives a distribution from a partnership of stock in another corporation (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;distributed corporation&rdquo;),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the corporate partner has control of the distributed corporation immediately after the distribution or at any time thereafter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the partnership's adjusted basis in such stock immediately before the distribution exceeded the corporate partner's adjusted basis in such stock immediately after the distribution,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then an amount equal to such excess shall be applied to reduce (in accordance with subsection (c)) the basis of property held by the distributed corporation at such time (or, if the corporate partner does not control the distributed corporation at such time, at the time the corporate partner first has such control).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception for certain distributions before control acquired</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any distribution of stock in the distributed corporation if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the corporate partner does not have control of such corporation immediately after such distribution, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the corporate partner establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such distribution was not part of a plan or arrangement to acquire control of the distributed corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitations on basis reduction</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of the reduction under paragraph (1) shall not exceed the amount by which the sum of the aggregate adjusted bases of the property and the amount of money of the distributed corporation exceeds the corporate partner's adjusted basis in the stock of the distributed corporation.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1661 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Reduction not to exceed adjusted basis of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No reduction under paragraph (1) in the basis of any property shall exceed the adjusted basis of such property (determined without regard to such reduction).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Gain recognition where reduction limited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the amount of any reduction under paragraph (1) (determined after the application of paragraph (3)(A)) exceeds the aggregate adjusted bases of the property of the distributed corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such excess shall be recognized by the corporate partner as long-term capital gain, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the corporate partner's adjusted basis in the stock of the distributed corporation shall be increased by such excess.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Control</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;control&rdquo; means ownership of stock meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Indirect distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), if a corporation acquires (other than in a distribution from a partnership) stock the basis of which is determined (by reason of being distributed from a partnership) in whole or in part by reference to subsection (a)(2) or (b), the corporation shall be treated as receiving a distribution of such stock from a partnership.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Special rule for stock in controlled corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the property held by a distributed corporation is stock in a corporation which the distributed corporation controls, this subsection shall be applied to reduce the basis of the property of such controlled corporation. This subsection shall be reapplied to any property of any controlled corporation which is stock in a corporation which it controls.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection, including regulations to avoid double counting and to prevent the abuse of such purposes.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The basis of partnership property shall not be adjusted as the result of a transfer of an interest in a partnership by sale or exchange or on the death of a partner unless the election provided by section 754 (relating to optional adjustment to basis of partnership property) is in effect with respect to such partnership or unless the partnership has a substantial built-in loss immediately after such transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustment to basis of partnership property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a transfer of an interest in a partnership by sale or exchange or upon the death of a partner, a partnership with respect to which the election provided in section 754 is in effect or which has a substantial built-in loss immediately after such transfer shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) increase the adjusted basis of the partnership property by the excess of the basis to the transferee partner of his interest in the partnership over his proportionate share of the adjusted basis of the partnership property, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) decrease the adjusted basis of the partnership property by the excess of the transferee partner's proportionate share of the adjusted basis of the partnership property over the basis of his interest in the partnership.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, such increase or decrease shall constitute an adjustment to the basis of partnership property with respect to the transferee partner only. A partner's proportionate share of the adjusted basis of partnership property shall be determined in accordance with his interest in partnership capital and, in the case of property contributed to the partnership by a partner, section 704(c) (relating to contributed property) shall apply in determining such share. In the case of an adjustment under this subsection to the basis of partnership property subject to depletion, any depletion allowable shall be determined separately for the transferee partner with respect to his interest in such property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocation of basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The allocation of basis among partnership properties where subsection (b) is applicable shall be made in accordance with the rules provided in section 755.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Substantial built-in loss</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, a partnership has a substantial built-in loss with respect to a transfer of an interest in a partnership if the partnership's adjusted basis in the partnership property exceeds by more than $250,000 the fair market value of such property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of paragraph (1) and section 734(d), including regulations aggregating related partnerships and disregarding property acquired by the partnership in an attempt to avoid such purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Alternative rules for electing investment partnerships</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) No adjustment of partnership basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, an electing investment partnership shall not be treated as having a substantial built-in loss with respect to any transfer occurring while the election under paragraph (6)(A) is in effect.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Loss deferral for transferee partner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a transfer of an interest in an electing investment partnership, the transferee partner's distributive share of losses (without regard to gains) from the sale or exchange of partnership property shall not be allowed except to the extent that it is established that such losses exceed the loss (if any) recognized by the transferor (or any prior transferor to the extent not fully offset by a prior disallowance under this paragraph) on the transfer of the partnership interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) No reduction in partnership basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Losses disallowed under paragraph (2) shall not decrease the transferee partner's basis in the partnership interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Effect of termination of partnership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall be applied without regard to any termination of a partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Certain basis reductions treated as losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a transferee partner whose basis in property distributed by the partnership is reduced under section 732(a)(2), the amount of the loss recognized by the transferor on the transfer of the partnership interest which is taken into account under paragraph (2) shall be reduced by the amount of such basis reduction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Electing investment partnership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;electing investment partnership&rdquo; means any partnership if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the partnership makes an election to have this subsection apply,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the partnership would be an investment company under section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 but for an exemption under paragraph (1) or (7) of section 3(c) of such Act,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such partnership has never been engaged in a trade or business,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) substantially all of the assets of such partnership are held for investment,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) at least 95 percent of the assets contributed to such partnership consist of money,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) no assets contributed to such partnership had an adjusted basis in excess of fair market value at the time of contribution,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) all partnership interests of such partnership are issued by such partnership pursuant to a private offering before the date which is 24 months after the date of the first capital contribution to such partnership,</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1666 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) the partnership agreement of such partnership has substantive restrictions on each partner's ability to cause a redemption of the partner's interest, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the partnership agreement of such partnership provides for a term that is not in excess of 15 years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The election described in subparagraph (A), once made, shall be irrevocable except with the consent of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this subsection, including regulations for applying this subsection to tiered partnerships.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Exception for securitization partnerships</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) No adjustment of partnership basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, a securitization partnership shall not be treated as having a substantial built-in loss with respect to any transfer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Securitization partnership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;securitization partnership&rdquo; means any partnership the sole business activity of which is to issue securities which provide for a fixed principal (or similar) amount and which are primarily serviced by the cash flows of a discrete pool (either fixed or revolving) of receivables or other financial assets that by their terms convert into cash in a finite period, but only if the sponsor of the pool reasonably believes that the receivables and other financial assets comprising the pool are not acquired so as to be disposed of.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) No allocation of basis decrease to stock of corporate partner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In making an allocation under subsection (a) of any decrease in the adjusted basis of partnership property under section 734(b)&mdash;</p>
