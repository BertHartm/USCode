Such relief from liability shall be effective from the time of removal from the transferor's bonded premises, or from the time of divestment of interest, whichever is later.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Withdrawals free of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All persons liable for the tax under subsection (a) or (b), or under any similar prior provisions of internal revenue law, shall be relieved of such liability as to distilled spirits withdrawn free of tax under the provisions of section 5214(a)(1), (2), (3), (11), or (12), or under section 7510, at the time such spirits are so withdrawn from bonded premises.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Withdrawals without payment of tax</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Liability for tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any person who withdraws distilled spirits from the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant without payment of tax, as provided in section 5214(a)(4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), or (13), shall be liable for the internal revenue tax on such distilled spirits, from the time of such withdrawal; and all persons liable for the tax on such distilled spirits under subsection (a) or (b), or under any similar prior provisions of internal revenue law, shall, at the time of such withdrawal, be relieved of any such liability on the distilled spirits so withdrawn if the person withdrawing such spirits and the person, or persons, liable for the tax under subsection (a) or (b), or under any similar prior provisions of internal revenue law, are independent of each other and neither has a proprietary interest, directly or indirectly, in the business of the other, and all persons liable for the tax under subsection (a) or (b), or under any similar prior provisions of internal revenue law, have divested themselves of all interest in the spirits so withdrawn.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this section, the tax on distilled spirits shall be determined when the spirits are withdrawn from bond. Such tax shall be determined by such means as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe, and with the use of such devices and apparatus (including but not limited to tanks and pipelines) as the Secretary may require. The tax on distilled spirits withdrawn from the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant shall be determined upon completion of the gauge for determination of tax and before withdrawal from bonded premises, under such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Distilled spirits not accounted for</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary finds that the distiller has not accounted for all the distilled spirits produced by him, he shall, from all the evidence he can obtain, determine what quantity of distilled spirits was actually produced by such distiller, and an assessment shall be made for the difference between the quantity reported and the quantity shown to have been actually produced at the rate of tax imposed by law for every proof gallon.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Taxable loss</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) On original quantity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where there is evidence satisfactory to the Secretary that there has been any loss of dis<!-- PDFPage:2716 -->tilled spirits from any cask or other package deposited on bonded premises, other than a loss which by reason of section 5008(a) is not taxable, the Secretary may require the withdrawal from bonded premises of such distilled spirits, and direct the officer designated by him to collect the tax accrued on the original quantity of distilled spirits entered for deposit on bonded premises in such cask or package; except that, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, when the extent of any loss from causes other than theft or unauthorized voluntary destruction can be established by the proprietor to the satisfaction of the Secretary an allowance of the tax on the loss so established may be credited against the tax on the original quantity. If such tax is not paid on demand it shall be assessed and collected as other taxes are assessed and collected.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Alternative method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where there is evidence satisfactory to the Secretary that there has been access, other than is authorized by law, to the contents of casks or packages stored on bonded premises, and the extent of such access is such as to evidence a lack of due diligence or a failure to employ necessary and effective controls on the part of the proprietor, the Secretary (in lieu of requiring the casks or packages to which such access has been had to be withdrawn and tax paid on the original quantity of distilled spirits entered for deposit on bonded premises in such casks or packages as provided in paragraph (1)) may assess an amount equal to the tax on 5 proof gallons of distilled spirits at the prevailing rate on each of the total number of such casks or packages as determined by him.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Application of subsection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of this subsection shall apply to distilled spirits which are filled into casks or packages, as authorized by law, after entry and deposit on bonded premises, whether by recasking, filling from storage tanks, consolidation of packages, or otherwise; and the quantity filled into such casks or packages shall be deemed to be the original quantity for the purpose of this subsection, in the case of loss from such casks or packages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Distilled spirits not bonded</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The tax on any distilled spirits, removed from the place where they were distilled and (except as otherwise provided by law) not deposited in storage on bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant, shall, at any time within the period of limitation provided in section 6501, when knowledge of such fact is obtained by the Secretary, be assessed on the distiller of such distilled spirits (or other person liable for the tax) and payment of such tax immediately demanded and, on the neglect or refusal of payment, the Secretary shall proceed to collect the same by distraint. This paragraph shall not exclude any other remedy or proceeding provided by law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Production at other than qualified plants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided by law, the tax on any distilled spirits produced in the United States at any place other than a qualified distilled spirits plant shall be due and payable immediately upon production.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Unlawfully imported distilled spirits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Distilled spirits smuggled or brought into the United States unlawfully shall, for purposes of this chapter, be held to be imported into the United States, and the internal revenue tax shall be due and payable at the time of such importation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Cross reference</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Imposition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby imposed on all wines (including imitation, substandard, or artificial wine, and compounds sold as wine) having not in excess of 24 percent of alcohol by volume, in bond in, produced in, or imported into, the United States, taxes at the rates shown in subsection (b), such taxes to be determined as of the time of removal for consumption or sale. All wines containing more than 24 percent of alcohol by volume shall be classed as distilled spirits and taxed accordingly. Still wines shall include those wines containing not more than 0.392 gram of carbon dioxide per hundred milliliters of wine; except that the Secretary may by regulations prescribe such tolerances to this maximum limitation as may be reasonably necessary in good commercial practice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rates of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) On still wines containing not more than 14 percent of alcohol by volume, $1.07 per wine gallon;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) On still wines containing more than 14 percent and not exceeding 21 percent of alcohol by volume, $1.57 per wine gallon;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) On still wines containing more than 21 percent and not exceeding 24 percent of alcohol by volume, $3.15 per wine gallon;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) On hard cider which is a still wine derived primarily from apples or apple concentrate and water, containing no other fruit product, and containing at least one-half of 1 percent and less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, 22.6 cents per wine gallon.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Credit for small domestic producers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Allowance of credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), in the case of a person who produces not more than 250,000 wine gallons of wine during the calendar year, there shall be allowed as a credit against any tax imposed by this title (other than chapters 2, 21, and 22) of 90 cents per wine gallon on the 1st 100,000 wine gallons of wine (other than wine described in subsection (b)(4)) which are removed during such year for consumption or sale and which have been produced at qualified facilities in the United States. In the case of wine described in subsection (b)(6), the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;5.6 cents&rdquo; for &ldquo;90 cents&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reduction in credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The credit allowable by paragraph (1) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by 1 percent for each 1,000 wine gallons of wine produced in excess of 150,000 wine gallons of wine during the calendar year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Time for determining and allowing credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The credit allowable by paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall be determined at the same time the tax is determined under subsection (a) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall be allowable at the time any tax described in paragraph (1) is payable as if the credit allowable by this subsection constituted a reduction in the rate of such tax.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Controlled groups</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Rules similar to rules of section 5051(a)(2)(B) shall apply for purposes of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Denial of deduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any deduction under subtitle A with respect to any tax against which a credit is allowed under this subsection shall only be for the amount of such tax as reduced by such credit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Credit for transferee in bond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) wine produced by any person would be eligible for any credit under paragraph (1) if removed by such person during the calendar year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) wine produced by such person is removed during such calendar year by any other person (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as the &ldquo;transferee&rdquo;) to whom such wine was transferred in bond and who is liable for the tax imposed by this section with respect to such wine, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such producer holds title to such wine at the time of its removal and provides to the transferee such information as is necessary to properly determine the transferee's credit under this paragraph,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then, the transferee (and not the producer) shall be allowed the credit under paragraph (1) which would be allowed to the producer if the wine removed by the transferee had been removed by the producer on that date.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2723 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection, including regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to prevent the credit provided in this subsection from benefiting any person who produces more than 250,000 wine gallons of wine during a calendar year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to assure proper reduction of such credit for persons producing more than 150,000 wine gallons of wine during a calendar year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Wine gallon</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of this chapter, the term &ldquo;wine gallon&rdquo; means a United States gallon of liquid measure equivalent to the volume of 231 cubic inches. On lesser quantities the tax shall be paid proportionately (fractions of less than one-tenth gallon being converted to the nearest one-tenth gallon, and five-hundredths gallon being converted to the next full one-tenth gallon).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Tolerances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where the Secretary finds that the revenue will not be endangered thereby, he may by regulation prescribe tolerances (but not greater than 1/2 of 1 percent) for bottles and other containers, and, if such tolerances are prescribed, no assessment shall be made and no tax shall be collected for any excess in any case where the contents of a bottle or other container are within the limit of the applicable tolerance prescribed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Illegally produced wine</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding subsection (a), any wine produced in the United States at any place other than the bonded premises provided for in this chapter shall (except as provided in section 5042 in the case of tax-free production) be subject to tax at the rate prescribed in subsection (b) at the time of production and whether or not removed for consumption or sale.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Rate of tax</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A tax is hereby imposed on all beer brewed or produced, and removed for consumption or sale, within the United States, or imported into the United States. Except as provided in paragraph (2), the rate of such tax shall be $18 for every barrel containing not more than 31 gallons and at a like rate for any other quantity or for fractional parts of a barrel.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reduced rate for certain domestic production</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) $7 a barrel rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a brewer who produces not more than 2,000,000 barrels of beer during the calendar year, the per barrel rate of the tax imposed by this section shall be $7 on the first 60,000 barrels of beer which are removed in such year for consumption or sale and which have been brewed or produced by such brewer at qualified breweries in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Controlled groups</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a controlled group, the 2,000,000 barrel quantity specified in subparagraph (A) shall be applied to the controlled group, and the 60,000 barrel quantity specified in subparagraph (A) shall be apportioned among the brewers who are component members of such group in such manner as the Secretary or his delegate shall by regulations prescribed. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;controlled group&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by subsection (a) of section 1563, except that for such purposes the phrase &ldquo;more than 50 percent&rdquo; shall be substituted for the phrase &ldquo;at least 80 percent&rdquo; in each place it appears in such subsection. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate, principles similar to the principles of the preceding two sentences shall be applied to a group of brewers under common control where one or more of the brewers is not a corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to prevent the reduced rates provided in this paragraph from benefiting any person who produces more than 2,000,000 barrels of beer during a calendar year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Tolerances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where the Secretary or his delegate finds that the revenue will not be endangered thereby, he may by regulations prescribe tolerances for barrels and fractional parts of barrels, and, if such tolerances are prescribed, no assessment shall be made and no tax shall be collected for any excess in any case where the contents of a barrel or a fractional part of a barrel are within the limit of the applicable tolerance prescribed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assessment on materials used in production in case of fraud</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing contained in this subpart or subchapter G shall be construed to authorize an assessment on the quantity of materials used in producing or purchased for the purpose of producing beer, nor shall the quantity of materials so used or purchased be evidence, for the purpose of taxation, of the quantity of beer produced; but the tax on all beer shall be paid as provided in section 5054, and not otherwise; except that this subsection shall not apply to cases of fraud, and nothing in this subsection shall have the effect to change the rules of law respecting evidence in any prosecution or suit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Illegally produced beer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The production of any beer at any place in the United States shall be subject to tax at the rate prescribed in subsection (a) and such tax shall be due and payable as provided in section 5054(a)(3) unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such beer is produced in a brewery qualified under the provisions of subchapter G, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such production is exempt from tax under section 5053(e) (relating to beer for personal or family use).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Beer returned or voluntarily destroyed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any tax paid by any brewer on beer removed for consumption or sale may be refunded or credited to the brewer, without interest, or if the tax has not been paid, the brewer may be relieved of liability therefor, under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, if such beer is returned to any brewery of the brewer or is destroyed under the supervision required by such regulations. In determining the amount of tax due on beer removed on any day, the quantity of beer returned to the same brewery from which removed shall be allowed, under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, as an offset against or deduction from the total quantity of beer removed from that brewery on the day of such return.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Beer lost by fire, theft, casualty, or act of God</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the tax paid by any brewer on beer removed for consumption or sale may be refunded or credited to the brewer, without interest, or if the tax has not been paid, the brewer may be relieved of liability therefor, if such beer is lost, whether by theft or otherwise, or is destroyed or otherwise rendered unmerchantable by fire, casualty, or act of God before the transfer of title thereto to any other person. In any case in which beer is lost or destroyed, whether by theft or otherwise, the Secretary may require the brewer to file a claim for relief from the tax and submit proof as to the cause of such loss. In every case where it appears that the loss was by theft, the first sentence shall not apply unless the brewer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such theft occurred before removal from the brewery and occurred without connivance, collusion, fraud, or negligence on the part of the brewer, consignor, consignee, bailee, or carrier, or the employees or agents of any of them.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Beer received at a distilled spirits plant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any tax paid by any brewer on beer removed for consumption or sale may be refunded or credited to the brewer, without interest, or if the tax has not been paid, the brewer may be relieved of liability therefor, under regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, if such beer is received on the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant pursuant to the provisions of section 5222(b)(2), for use in the production of distilled spirits.</p>
