<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirements for qualification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A trust created or organized in the United States and forming part of a stock bonus, pension, or profit-sharing plan of an employer for the exclusive benefit of his employees or their beneficiaries shall constitute a qualified trust under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if contributions are made to the trust by such employer, or employees, or both, or by another employer who is entitled to deduct his contributions under section 404(a)(3)(B) (relating to deduction for contributions to profit-sharing and stock bonus plans), or by a charitable remainder trust pursuant to a qualified gratuitous transfer (as defined in section 664(g)(1)), for the purpose of distributing to such employees or their beneficiaries the corpus and income of the fund accumulated by the trust in accordance with such plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if under the trust instrument it is impossible, at any time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to employees and their beneficiaries under the trust, for any part of the corpus or income to be (within the taxable year or thereafter) used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of his employees or their beneficiaries (but this paragraph shall not be construed, in the case of a multiemployer plan, to prohibit the return of a contribution within 6 months after the plan administrator determines that the contribution was made by a mistake of fact or law (other than a mistake relating to whether the plan is described in section 401(a) or the trust which is part of such plan is exempt from taxation under section 501(a), or the return of any withdrawal liability payment determined to be an overpayment within 6 months of such determination).;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#401_1_target" name="401_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if the plan of which such trust is a part satisfies the requirements of section 410 (relating to minimum participation standards); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) if the contributions or benefits provided under the plan do not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)). For purposes of this paragraph, there shall be excluded from consideration employees described in section 410(b)(3)(A) and (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Special rules relating to nondiscrimination requirements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Salaried or clerical employees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A classification shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of paragraph (4) or section 410(b)(2)(A)(i) merely because it is limited to salaried or clerical employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Contributions and benefits may bear uniform relationship to compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A plan shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of paragraph (4) merely because the contributions or benefits of, or on behalf of, the employees under the plan bear a uniform relationship to the compensation (within the meaning of section 414(s)) of such employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Certain disparity permitted</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A plan shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of paragraph (4) merely because the contributions or benefits of, or on behalf of, the employees under the plan favor highly compensated employees (as defined in section 414(q)) in the manner permitted under subsection (l).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Integrated defined benefit plan.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A defined benefit plan shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of paragraph (4) merely because the plan provides that the employer-derived accrued retirement benefit for any participant under the plan may not exceed the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the participant's final pay with the employer, over</p>
<!-- PDFPage:842 --><p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the employer-derived retirement benefit created under Federal law attributable to service by the participant with the employer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;For purposes of this clause, the employer-derived retirement benefit created under Federal law shall be treated as accruing ratably over 35 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Final pay</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this subparagraph, the participant's final pay is the compensation (as defined in section 414(q)(4)) paid to the participant by the employer for any year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) which ends during the 5-year period ending with the year in which the participant separated from service for the employer, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) for which the participant's total compensation from the employer was highest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) 2 <cap-smallcap>or more plans treated as single plan</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of determining whether 2 or more plans of an employer satisfy the requirements of paragraph (4) when considered as a single plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>Contributions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the amount of contributions on behalf of the employees allowed as a deduction under section 404 for the taxable year with respect to such plans, taken together, bears a uniform relationship to the compensation (within the meaning of section 414(s)) of such employees, the plans shall not be considered discriminatory merely because the rights of employees to, or derived from, the employer contributions under the separate plans do not become nonforfeitable at the same rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Benefits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the employees&rsquo; rights to benefits under the separate plans do not become nonforfeitable at the same rate, but the levels of benefits provided by the separate plans satisfy the requirements of regulations prescribed by the Secretary to take account of the differences in such rates, the plans shall not be considered discriminatory merely because of the difference in such rates.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) <cap-smallcap>Social security retirement age</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of testing for discrimination under paragraph (4)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the social security retirement age (as defined in section 415(b)(8)) shall be treated as a uniform retirement age, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) subsidized early retirement benefits and joint and survivor annuities shall not be treated as being unavailable to employees on the same terms merely because such benefits or annuities are based in whole or in part on an employee's social security retirement age (as so defined).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) <cap-smallcap>State and local governmental plans</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Paragraphs (3) and (4) shall not apply to a governmental plan (within the meaning of section 414(d)) maintained by a State or local government or political subdivision thereof (or agency or instrumentality thereof).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A plan shall be considered as meeting the requirements of paragraph (3) during the whole of any taxable year of the plan if on one day in each quarter it satisfied such requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan of which such trust is a part satisfies the requirements of section 411 (relating to minimum vesting standards).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) A trust forming part of a defined benefit plan shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan provides that forfeitures must not be applied to increase the benefits any employee would otherwise receive under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) <cap-smallcap>Required distributions.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this subsection unless the plan provides that the entire interest of each employee&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) will be distributed, beginning not later than the required beginning date, in accordance with regulations, over the life of such employee or over the lives of such employee and a designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such employee or the life expectancy of such employee and a designated beneficiary).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Required distribution where employee dies before entire interest is distributed.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>Where distributions have begun under subparagraph</cap-smallcap> (A)(ii).&mdash;A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan provides that if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the distribution of the employee's interest has begun in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the employee dies before his entire interest has been distributed to him,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;the remaining portion of such interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distributions being used under subparagraph (A)(ii) as of the date of his death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 5-<cap-smallcap>year rule for other cases</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan provides that, if an employee dies before the distribution of the employee's interest has begun in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii), the entire interest of the employee will be distributed within 5 years after the death of such employee.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Multiple plans treated as a single plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If two or more plans of an employer to which matching contributions, employee contributions, or elective deferrals are made are treated as one plan for purposes of section 410(b), such plans shall be treated as one plan for purposes of this subsection. If a highly compensated employee participates in two or more plans of an employer to which contributions to which this subsection applies are made, all such contributions shall be aggregated for purposes of this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Method of distributing excess aggregate contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any distribution of the excess aggregate contributions for any plan year shall be made to highly compensated employees on the basis of the amount of contributions on behalf of, or by, each such employee.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Coordination with subsection (k) and 402(g)</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Taxability of beneficiary of exempt trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, any amount actually distributed to any distributee by any employees&rsquo; trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a) shall be taxable to the distributee, in the taxable year of the distributee in which distributed, under section 72 (relating to annuities).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Taxability of beneficiary of nonexempt trust</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Contributions to an employees&rsquo; trust made by an employer during a taxable year of the employer which ends with or within a taxable year of the trust for which the trust is not exempt from tax under section 501(a) shall be included in the gross income of the employee in accordance with section 83 (relating to property transferred in connection with performance of services), except that the value of the employee's interest in the trust shall be substituted for the fair market value of the property for purposes of applying such section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount actually distributed or made available to any distributee by any trust described in paragraph (1) shall be taxable to the distributee, in the taxable year in which so distributed or made available, under section 72 (relating to annuities), except that distributions of income of such trust before the annuity starting date (as defined in section 72(c)(4)) shall be included in the gross income of the employee without regard to section 72(e)(5) (relating to amounts not received as annuities).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Grantor trusts</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Failure to meet requirements of section 410(b)</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Highly compensated employees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If 1 of the reasons a trust is not exempt from tax under section 501(a) is the failure of the plan of which it is a part to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(26) or 410(b), then a highly compensated employee shall, in lieu of the amount determined under paragraph (1) or (2) include in gross income for the taxable year with or within which the taxable year of the trust ends an amount equal to the vested accrued benefit of such employee (other than the employee's investment in the contract) as of the close of such taxable year of the trust.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Failure to meet coverage tests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a trust is not exempt from tax under section 501(a) for any taxable year solely because such trust is part of a plan which fails to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(26) or 410(b), paragraphs (1) and (2) <!-- PDFPage:880 -->shall not apply by reason of such failure to any employee who was not a highly compensated employee during&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of a distribution of property other than money, the amount so transferred consists of the property distributed,</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the portion of the money or other property which is to be treated as included in the rollover contribution,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">shall be determined on a ratable basis unless the taxpayer designates otherwise. Any des<!-- PDFPage:881 -->ignation under this subparagraph for a taxable year shall be made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return for such taxable year (including extensions thereof).

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If contributions are paid by an employer to or under a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plan, or if compensation is paid or accrued on account of any employee under a plan deferring the receipt of such compensation, such contributions or compensation shall not be deductible under this chapter; but, if they would otherwise be deductible, they shall be deductible under this section, subject, however, to the following limitations as to the amounts deductible in any year:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:908 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Pension trusts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the taxable year when paid, if the contributions are paid into a pension trust (other than a trust to which paragraph (3) applies), and if such taxable year ends within or with a taxable year of the trust for which the trust is exempt under section 501(a), in an amount determined as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount necessary to satisfy the minimum funding standard provided by section 412(a) for plan years ending within or with such taxable year (or for any prior plan year), if such amount is greater than the amount determined under clause (ii) or (iii) (whichever is applicable with respect to the plan),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount necessary to provide with respect to all of the employees under the trust the remaining unfunded cost of their past and current service credits distributed as a level amount, or a level percentage of compensation, over the remaining future service of each such employee, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, but if such remaining unfunded cost with respect to any 3 individuals is more than 50 percent of such remaining unfunded cost, the amount of such unfunded cost attributable to such individuals shall be distributed over a period of at least 5 taxable years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) an amount equal to the normal cost of the plan, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, plus, if past service or other supplementary pension or annuity credits are provided by the plan, an amount necessary to amortize the unfunded costs attributable to such credits in equal annual payments (until fully amortized) over 10 years, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In determining the amount deductible in such year under the foregoing limitations the funding method and the actuarial assumptions used shall be those used for such year under section 412, and the maximum amount deductible for such year shall be an amount equal to the full funding limitation for such year determined under section 412.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule in case of certain amendments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a plan which the Secretary of Labor finds to be collectively bargained which makes an election under this subparagraph (in such manner and at such time as may be provided under regulations prescribed by the Secretary), if the full funding limitation determined under section 412(c)(7) for such year is zero, if as a result of any plan amendment applying to such plan year, the amount determined under section 412(c)(7)(B) exceeds the amount determined under section 412(c)(7)(A), and if the funding method and the actuarial assumptions used are those used for such year under section 412, the maximum amount deductible in such year under the limitations of this paragraph shall be an amount equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the full funding limitation for such year determined by applying section 412(c)(7) but increasing the amount referred to in subparagraph (A) thereof by the decrease in the present value of all unamortized liabilities resulting from such amendment, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the normal cost under the plan reduced by the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments over 10 years (until fully amortized) the decrease described in clause (i).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In the case of any election under this subparagraph, the amount deductible under the limitations of this paragraph with respect to any of the plan years following the plan year for which such election was made shall be determined as provided under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary to carry out the purposes of this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Certain collectively-bargained plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a plan which the Secretary of Labor finds to be collectively bargained, established or maintained by an employer doing business in not less than 40 States and engaged in the trade or business of furnishing or selling services described in section 168(i)(10)(C), with respect to which the rates have been established or approved by a State or political subdivision thereof, by any agency or instrumentality of the United States, or by a public service or public utility commission or other similar body of any State or political subdivision thereof, and in the case of any employer which is a member of a controlled group with such employer, subparagraph (B) shall be applied by substituting for the words &ldquo;plan amendment&rdquo; the words &ldquo;plan amendment or increase in benefits payable under title II of the Social Security Act&rdquo;. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;controlled group&rdquo; has the meaning provided by section 1563(a), determined without regard to section 1563(a)(4) and (e)(3)(C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Special rule in case of certain plans</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of any defined benefit plan, except as provided in regulations, the maximum amount deductible under the limitations of this paragraph shall not be less than the unfunded current liability determined under section 412(<em>l</em>).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Plans with 100 or less participants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, in the case of a plan which has 100 or less participants for the plan year, unfunded current liability shall not include the liability attributable to benefit increases for highly compensated employees (as defined in section 414(q)) resulting from a plan amendment which is made or becomes effective, whichever is later, within the last 2 years.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Rule for determining number of participants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of determining the number of plan participants, all defined benefit <!-- PDFPage:909 -->plans maintained by the same employer (or any member of such employer's controlled group (within the meaning of section 412(<em>l</em>)(8)(C))) shall be treated as one plan, but only employees of such member or employer shall be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Special rule for terminating plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of a plan which, subject to section 4041 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, terminates during the plan year, clause (i) shall be applied by substituting for unfunded current liability the amount required to make the plan sufficient for benefit liabilities (within the meaning of section 4041(d) of such Act).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Carryover</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount paid in a taxable year in excess of the amount deductible in such year under the foregoing limitations shall be deductible in the succeeding taxable years in order of time to the extent of the difference between the amount paid and deductible in each such succeeding year and the maximum amount deductible for such year under the foregoing limitations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Employees&rsquo; annuities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the taxable year when paid, in an amount determined in accordance with paragraph (1), if the contributions are paid toward the purchase of retirement annuities, or retirement annuities and medical benefits as described in section 401(h), and such purchase is part of a plan which meets the requirements of section 401(a)(3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), (16), (17),<sup><a href="#404_1_target" name="404_1">1</a></sup> (19), (20), (22), (26), (27), and (31) and, if applicable, the requirements of section 401(a)(10) and of section 401(d), and if refunds of premiums, if any, are applied within the current taxable year or next succeeding taxable year toward the purchase of such retirement annuities, or such retirement annuities and medical benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Stock bonus and profit-sharing trusts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Limits on deductible contributions</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the taxable year when paid, if the contributions are paid into a stock bonus or profit-sharing trust, and if such taxable year ends within or with a taxable year of the trust with respect to which the trust is exempt under section 501(a), in an amount not in excess of the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) 25 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during the taxable year to the beneficiaries under the stock bonus or profit-sharing plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the amount such employer is required to contribute to such trust under section 401(k)(11) for such year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Carryover of excess contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any amount paid into the trust in any taxable year in excess of the limitation of clause (i) (or the corresponding provision of prior law) shall be deductible in the succeeding taxable years in order of time, but the amount so deductible under this clause in any 1 such succeeding taxable year together with the amount allowable under clause (i) shall not exceed the amount described in subclause (I) or (II) of clause (i), whichever is greater, with respect to such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Certain retirement plans excluded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;stock bonus or profit-sharing trust&rdquo; shall not include any trust designed to provide benefits upon retirement and covering a period of years, if under the plan the amounts to be contributed by the employer can be determined actuarially as provided in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) 2 or more trusts treated as 1 trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the contributions are made to 2 or more stock bonus or profit-sharing trusts, such trusts shall be considered a single trust for purposes of applying the limitations in this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(v) Defined contribution plans subject to the funding standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided by the Secretary, a defined contribution plan which is subject to the funding standards of section 412 shall be treated in the same manner as a stock bonus or profit-sharing plan for purposes of this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Profit-sharing plan of affiliated group</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a profit-sharing plan, or a stock bonus plan in which contributions are determined with reference to profits, of a group of corporations which is an affiliated group within the meaning of section 1504, if any member of such affiliated group is prevented from making a contribution which it would otherwise have made under the plan, by reason of having no current or accumulated earnings or profits or because such earnings or profits are less than the contributions which it would otherwise have made, then so much of the contribution which such member was so prevented from making may be made, for the benefit of the employees of such member, by the other members of the group, to the extent of current or accumulated earnings or profits, except that such contribution by each such other member shall be limited, where the group does not file a consolidated return, to that proportion of its total current and accumulated earnings or profits remaining after adjustment for its contribution deductible without regard to this subparagraph which the total prevented contribution bears to the total current and accumulated earnings or profits of all the members of the group remaining after adjustment for all contributions deductible without regard to this subparagraph. Contributions made under the preceding sentence shall be deductible under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph by the employer making such contribution, and, for the purpose of determining amounts which may be carried for<!-- PDFPage:910 -->ward and deducted under the second sentence of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph in succeeding taxable years, shall be deemed to have been made by the employer on behalf of whose employees such contributions were made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Trusts created or organized outside the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a stock bonus, pension, or profit-sharing trust would qualify for exemption under section 501(a) except for the fact that it is a trust created or organized outside the United States, contributions to such a trust by an employer which is a resident, or corporation, or other entity of the United States, shall be deductible under the preceding paragraphs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Other plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the plan is not one included in paragraph (1), (2), or (3), in the taxable year in which an amount attributable to the contribution is includible in the gross income of employees participating in the plan, but, in the case of a plan in which more than one employee participates only if separate accounts are maintained for each employee. For purposes of this section, any vacation pay which is treated as deferred compensation shall be deductible for the taxable year of the employer in which paid to the employee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Time when contributions deemed made</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), a taxpayer shall be deemed to have made a payment on the last day of the preceding taxable year if the payment is on account of such taxable year and is made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return for such taxable year (including extensions thereof).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Limitation on deductions where combination of defined contribution plan and defined benefit plan</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If amounts are deductible under the foregoing paragraphs of this subsection (other than paragraph (5)) in connection with 1 or more defined contribution plans and 1 or more defined benefit plans or in connection with trusts or plans described in 2 or more of such paragraphs, the total amount deductible in a taxable year under such plans shall not exceed the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 25 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during the taxable year to the beneficiaries under such plans, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of contributions made to or under the defined benefit plans to the extent such contributions do not exceed the amount of employer contributions necessary to satisfy the minimum funding standard provided by section 412 with respect to any such defined benefit plans for the plan year which ends with or within such taxable year (or for any prior plan year).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">A defined contribution plan which is a pension plan shall not be treated as failing to provide definitely determinable benefits merely by limiting employer contributions to amounts deductible under this section. For purposes of clause (ii), if paragraph (1)(D) applies to a defined benefit plan for any plan year, the amount necessary to satisfy the minimum funding standard provided by section 412 with respect to such plan for such plan year shall not be less than the unfunded current liability of such plan under section 412(<em>l</em>).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Carryover of contributions in excess of the deductible limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount paid under the plans in any taxable year in excess of the limitation of subparagraph (A) shall be deductible in the succeeding taxable years in order of time, but the amount so deductible under this subparagraph in any 1 such succeeding taxable year together with the amount allowable under subparagraph (A) shall not exceed 25 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during such taxable year to the beneficiaries under the plans.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Paragraph not to apply in certain cases</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Beneficiary test</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">This paragraph shall not have the effect of reducing the amount otherwise deductible under paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), if no employee is a beneficiary under more than 1 trust or under a trust and an annuity plan.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Elective deferrals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If, in connection with 1 or more defined contribution plans and 1 or more defined benefit plans, no amounts (other than elective deferrals (as defined in section 402(g)(3))) are contributed to any of the defined contribution plans for the taxable year, then subparagraph (A) shall not apply with respect to any of such defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Section 412(i) plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, any plan described in section 412(i) shall be treated as a defined benefit plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Self-employed individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a plan included in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) which provides contributions or benefits for employees some or all of whom are employees within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), for purposes of this section&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<!-- PDFPage:933 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Partial rollovers permitted</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If any amount paid or distributed out of an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity would meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) but for the fact that the entire amount was not paid into an eligible plan as required by clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A), such amount shall be treated as meeting the requirements of subparagraph (A) to the extent it is paid into an eligible plan referred to in such clause not later than the 60th day referred to in such clause.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) notwithstanding the pro rata allocation of income on, and investment in, the contract to distributions under section 72, the portion of such distribution rolled over to an eligible retirement plan described in clause (i) shall be treated as from income on the contract (to the extent of the aggregate income on the contract from all individual retirement plans of the distributee), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) appropriate adjustments shall be made in applying section 72 to other distributions in such taxable year and subsequent taxable years.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(I) Waiver of 60-day requirement</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Contributions returned before due date of return</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Distributions of excess contributions after due date for taxable year and certain excess rollover contributions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any individual, if the aggregate contributions (other than rollover contributions) paid for any taxable year to an individual retirement account or for an individual retirement annuity do not exceed the dollar amount in effect under section 219(b)(1)(A), paragraph (1) shall not apply to the distribution of any such contribution to the extent that such contribution exceeds the amount allowable as a deduction under section 219 for the taxable year for which the contribution was paid&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if such distribution is received after the date described in paragraph (4),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) but only to the extent that no deduction has been allowed under section 219 with respect to such excess contribution.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">If employer contributions on behalf of the individual are paid for the taxable year to a simplified employee pension, the dollar limitation of the preceding sentence shall be increased by the lesser of the amount of such contributions or the dollar limitation in effect under section 415(c)(1)(A) for such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Excess rollover contributions attributable to erroneous information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the taxpayer reasonably relies on information supplied pursuant to subtitle F for determining the amount of a rollover contribution, but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the information was erroneous,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:934 --><p class="statutory-body-block-2em">subparagraph (A) shall be applied by increasing the dollar limit set forth therein by that portion of the excess contribution which was attributable to such information.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this paragraph, the amount allowable as a deduction under section 219 shall be computed without regard to section 219(g).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Transfer of account incident to divorce</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The transfer of an individual's interest in an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity to his spouse or former spouse under a divorce or separation instrument described in subparagraph (A) of section 71(b)(2) is not to be considered a taxable transfer made by such individual notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, and such interest at the time of the transfer is to be treated as an individual retirement account of such spouse, and not of such individual. Thereafter such account or annuity for purposes of this subtitle is to be treated as maintained for the benefit of such spouse.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Special rules for simplified employee pensions or simple retirement accounts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Transfer or rollover of contributions prohibited until deferral test met</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection or section 72(t), paragraph (1) and section 72(t)(1) shall apply to the transfer or distribution from a simplified employee pension of any contribution under a salary reduction arrangement described in subsection (k)(6) (or any income allocable thereto) before a determination as to whether the requirements of subsection (k)(6)(A)(iii) are met with respect to such contribution.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certain exclusions treated as deductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraphs (4) and (5) and section 4973, any amount excludable or excluded from gross income under section 402(h) or 402(k) shall be treated as an amount allowable or allowed as a deduction under section 219.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Tax treatment of accounts and annuities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Exemption from tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any individual retirement account is exempt from taxation under this subtitle unless such account has ceased to be an individual retirement account by reason of paragraph (2) or (3). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any such account is subject to the taxes imposed by section 511 (relating to imposition of tax on unrelated business income of charitable, etc. organizations).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Loss of exemption of account where employee engages in prohibited transaction</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, during any taxable year of the individual for whose benefit any individual retirement account is established, that individual or his beneficiary engages in any transaction prohibited by section 4975 with respect to such account, such account ceases to be an individual retirement account as of the first day of such taxable year. For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the individual for whose benefit any account was established is treated as the creator of such account, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the separate account for any individual within an individual retirement account maintained by an employer or association of employees is treated as a separate individual retirement account.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Account treated as distributing all its assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case in which any account ceases to be an individual retirement account by reason of subparagraph (A) as of the first day of any taxable year, paragraph (1) of subsection (d) applies as if there were a distribution on such first day in an amount equal to the fair market value (on such first day) of all assets in the account (on such first day).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect of borrowing on annuity contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If during any taxable year the owner of an individual retirement annuity borrows any money under or by use of such contract, the contract ceases to be an individual retirement annuity as of the first day of such taxable year.

<p class="statutory-body-4em">If the spouse of the individual described in subclause (I) acquires the individual's entire interest in any Roth IRA to which such qualified rollover contribution is properly allocable, the spouse may elect to treat the remaining amounts described in subclause (I) as includible in the spouse's gross income in the taxable years of the spouse ending with or within the taxable years of such individual in which such amounts would otherwise have been includible. Any such election may not be made or changed after the due date for the spouse's taxable year which includes the date of death.</p>
