<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) was disabled for a continuous period ending on such date,</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purposes of subparagraph (A), the determination of whether property is qualified real property with respect to the first decedent shall be made without regard to subparagraph (D) of paragraph (1) and without regard to whether an election under this section was made.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Coordination with paragraph (4)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case in which to do so will enable the requirements of paragraph (1)(C)(ii) to be met with respect to the surviving spouse, this subsection and subsection (c) shall be applied by taking into account any application of paragraph (4).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Tax treatment of dispositions and failures to use for qualified use</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Imposition of additional estate tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, within 10 years after the decedent's death and before the death of the qualified heir&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the qualified heir disposes of any interest in qualified real property (other than by a disposition to a member of his family), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the qualified heir ceases to use for the qualified use the qualified real property which was acquired (or passed) from the decedent,</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of additional tax</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of the additional tax imposed by paragraph (1) with respect to any interest shall be the amount equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the adjusted tax difference attributable to such interest, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the excess of the amount realized with respect to the interest (or, in any case other than a sale or exchange at arm's length, the fair market value of the interest) over the value of the interest determined under subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjusted tax difference attributable to interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the adjusted tax difference attributable to an interest is the amount which bears the same ratio to the adjusted tax difference with respect to the estate (determined under subparagraph (C)) as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the excess of the value of such interest for purposes of this chapter (determined without regard to subsection (a)) over the value of such interest determined under subsection (a), bears to</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the disposition of a right to sever shall be treated as the disposition of the standing timber.

In determining the value of a possibility that property may be subject to a power of disposition by the decedent, such possibility shall be valued as if it were a possibility that such property may return to the decedent or his estate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an interest so transferred shall not be included in the decedent's gross estate under this section if possession or enjoyment of the property could have been obtained by any beneficiary during the decedent's life through the exercise of a general power of appointment (as defined in section 2041) which in fact was exercisable immediately before the decedent's death.</p>

For the purposes of this clause a person who, after the death of the decedent, may be possessed of a power of appointment (with respect to the property subject to the decedent's power) which he may exercise in his own favor shall be deemed as having an interest in the property and such interest shall be deemed adverse to such exercise of the decedent's power.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) If (after the application of clauses (i) and (ii)) the power is a general power of appointment and is exercisable in favor of such other person&mdash;such power shall be deemed a general power of appointment only in respect of a fractional part of the property subject to such power, such part to be determined by dividing the value of such property by the number of such persons (including the decedent) in favor of whom such power is exercisable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of clauses (ii) and (iii), a power shall be deemed to be exercisable in favor of a person if it is exercisable in favor of such person, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Lapse of power</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The lapse of a power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, during the life of the individual possessing the power shall be considered a release of such power.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 5 percent of the aggregate value, at the time of such lapse, of the assets out of which, or the proceeds of which, the exercise of the lapsed powers could have been satisfied.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Date of creation of power</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, a power of appointment created by a will executed on or before October 21, 1942, shall be considered a power created on or before such date if the person executing such will dies before July 1, 1949, without having republished such will, by codicil or otherwise, after October 21, 1942.</p>
