<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Distributions other than in liquidation of a partner's interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The basis of property (other than money) distributed by a partnership to a partner other than in liquidation of the partner's interest shall, except as provided in paragraph (2), be its adjusted basis to the partnership immediately before such distribution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The basis to the distributee partner of property to which paragraph (1) is applicable shall not exceed the adjusted basis of such partner's interest in the partnership reduced by any money distributed in the same transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Distributions in liquidation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The basis of property (other than money) distributed by a partnership to a partner in liquidation of the partner's interest shall be an amount equal to the adjusted basis of such partner's interest in the partnership reduced by any money distributed in the same transaction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocation of basis</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The basis of distributed properties to which subsection (a)(2) or (b) is applicable shall be allocated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) first to any unrealized receivables (as defined in section 751(c)) and inventory items (as defined in section 751(d)) in an amount equal to the adjusted basis of each such property to the partnership, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if the basis to be allocated is less than the sum of the adjusted bases of such properties to the partnership, then, to the extent any decrease is required in order to have the adjusted bases of such properties equal the basis to be allocated, in the manner provided in paragraph (3), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to the extent of any basis remaining after the allocation under subparagraph (A), to other distributed properties&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) first by assigning to each such other property such other property's adjusted basis to the partnership, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) then, to the extent any increase or decrease in basis is required in order to have the adjusted bases of such other distributed properties equal such remaining basis, in the manner provided in paragraph (2) or (3), whichever is appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Method of allocating increase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any increase required under paragraph (1)(B) shall be allocated among the properties&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) first to properties with unrealized appreciation in proportion to their respective amounts of unrealized appreciation before such increase (but only to the extent of each property's unrealized appreciation), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) then, to the extent such increase is not allocated under subparagraph (A), in proportion to their respective fair market values.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Method of allocating decrease</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any decrease required under paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B) shall be allocated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) first to properties with unrealized depreciation in proportion to their respective amounts of unrealized depreciation before such decrease (but only to the extent of each property's unrealized depreciation), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) then, to the extent such decrease is not allocated under subparagraph (A), in proportion to their respective adjusted bases (as adjusted under subparagraph (A)).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special partnership basis to transferee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsections (a), (b), and (c), a partner who acquired all or a part of his interest by a transfer with respect to which the election provided in section 754 is not in effect, and to whom a distribution of property (other than money) is made with respect to the transferred interest within 2 years after such transfer, may elect, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to treat as the adjusted partnership basis of such property the adjusted basis such property would have if the adjustment provided in section 743(b) were in effect with respect to the partnership property. The Secretary may by regulations require the application of this subsection in the case of a distribution to a transferee partner, whether or not made within 2 years after the transfer, if at the time of the transfer the fair market value of the partnership property (other than money) exceeded 110 percent of its adjusted basis to the partnership.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not apply to the extent that a distribution is treated as a sale or exchange of <!-- PDFPage:1367 -->property under section 751(b) (relating to unrealized receivables and inventory items).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Corresponding adjustment to basis of assets of a distributed corporation controlled by a corporate partner</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a corporation (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;corporate partner&rdquo;) receives a distribution from a partnership of stock in another corporation (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;distributed corporation&rdquo;),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the corporate partner has control of the distributed corporation immediately after the distribution or at any time thereafter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the partnership's adjusted basis in such stock immediately before the distribution exceeded the corporate partner's adjusted basis in such stock immediately after the distribution,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then an amount equal to such excess shall be applied to reduce (in accordance with subsection (c)) the basis of property held by the distributed corporation at such time (or, if the corporate partner does not control the distributed corporation at such time, at the time the corporate partner first has such control).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception for certain distributions before control acquired</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any distribution of stock in the distributed corporation if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the corporate partner does not have control of such corporation immediately after such distribution, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the corporate partner establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such distribution was not part of a plan or arrangement to acquire control of the distributed corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitations on basis reduction</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of the reduction under paragraph (1) shall not exceed the amount by which the sum of the aggregate adjusted bases of the property and the amount of money of the distributed corporation exceeds the corporate partner's adjusted basis in the stock of the distributed corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Reduction not to exceed adjusted basis of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No reduction under paragraph (1) in the basis of any property shall exceed the adjusted basis of such property (determined without regard to such reduction).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Gain recognition where reduction limited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the amount of any reduction under paragraph (1) (determined after the application of paragraph (3)(A)) exceeds the aggregate adjusted bases of the property of the distributed corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such excess shall be recognized by the corporate partner as long-term capital gain, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the corporate partner's adjusted basis in the stock of the distributed corporation shall be increased by such excess.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Control</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;control&rdquo; means ownership of stock meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Indirect distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), if a corporation acquires (other than in a distribution from a partnership) stock the basis of which is determined (by reason of being distributed from a partnership) in whole or in part by reference to subsection (a)(2) or (b), the corporation shall be treated as receiving a distribution of such stock from a partnership.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Special rule for stock in controlled corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the property held by a distributed corporation is stock in a corporation which the distributed corporation controls, this subsection shall be applied to reduce the basis of the property of such controlled corporation. This subsection shall be reapplied to any property of any controlled corporation which is stock in a corporation which it controls.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection, including regulations to avoid double counting and to prevent the abuse of such purposes.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any distribution by a partnership to a partner, such partner shall be treated as recognizing gain in an amount equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Gain recognized under the preceding sentence shall be in addition to any gain recognized under section 731. The character of such gain shall be determined by reference to the proportionate character of the net precontribution gain.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Net precontribution gain</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Distributions of previously contributed property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any portion of the property distributed consists of property which had been contributed by the distributee partner to the partnership, such property shall not be taken into account under subsection (a)(1) and shall not be taken into account in determining the amount of the net precontribution gain. If the property distributed consists of an interest in an entity, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent that the value of such interest is attributable to property contributed to such entity after such interest had been contributed to the partnership.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any increase or decrease in the adjusted basis of partnership property under section 734(b) (relating to the optional adjustment to the basis of undistributed partnership property) or section 743(b) (relating to the optional adjustment to the basis of partnership property in the case of a transfer of an interest in a partnership) shall, except as provided in subsection (b), be allocated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in a manner which has the effect of reducing the difference between the fair market value and the adjusted basis of partnership properties, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in any other manner permitted by regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In applying the allocation rules provided in subsection (a), increases or decreases in the adjusted basis of partnership property arising from a distribution of, or a transfer of an interest attributable to, property consisting of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) capital assets and property described in section 1231(b), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any other property of the partnership,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be allocated to partnership property of a like character except that the basis of any such partnership property shall not be reduced below zero. If, in the case of a distribution, the adjustment to basis of property described in paragraph (1) or (2) is prevented by the absence of such property or by insufficient adjusted basis for such property, such adjustment shall be applied to subsequently acquired property of a like character in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
