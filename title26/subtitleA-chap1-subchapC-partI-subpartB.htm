<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this subsection and subsection (a), the adjusted basis of any property is its adjusted basis as determined for purposes of computing earnings and profits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjustments for liabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In making the adjustments to the earnings and profits of a corporation under subsection (a) or (b), proper adjustment shall be made for&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The gain or loss realized from the sale or other disposition (after February 28, 1913) of property by a corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for the purpose of the computation of the earnings and profits of the corporation, shall (except as provided in subparagraph (B)) be determined by using as the adjusted basis the adjusted basis (under the law applicable to the year in which the sale or other disposition was made) for determining gain, except that no regard shall be had to the value of the property as of March 1, 1913; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for purposes of the computation of the earnings and profits of the corporation for any period beginning after February 28, 1913, shall be determined by using as the adjusted basis the adjusted basis (under the law applicable to the year in which the sale or other disposition was made) for determining gain.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Gain or loss so realized shall increase or decrease the earnings and profits to, but not be<!-- PDFPage:700 -->yond, the extent to which such a realized gain or loss was recognized in computing taxable income under the law applicable to the year in which such sale or disposition was made.

For purposes of this subsection, a loss with respect to which a deduction is disallowed under section 1091 (relating to wash sales of stock or securities), or the corresponding provision of prior law, shall not be deemed to be recognized.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effect on earnings and profits of receipt of tax-free distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where a corporation receives (after February 28, 1913) a distribution from a second corporation which (under the law applicable to the year in which the distribution was made) was not a taxable dividend to the shareholders of the second corporation, the amount of such distribution shall not increase the earnings and profits of the first corporation in the following cases:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) no such increase shall be made in respect of the part of such distribution which (under such law) is directly applied in reduction of the basis of the stock in respect of which the distribution was made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) no such increase shall be made if (under such law) the distribution causes the basis of the stock in respect of which the distribution was made to be allocated between such stock and the property received (or such basis would, but for section 307(b), be so allocated).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Earnings and profits&mdash;increase in value accrued before March 1, 1913</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If any increase or decrease in the earnings and profits for any period beginning after February 28, 1913, with respect to any matter would be different had the adjusted basis of the property involved been determined without regard to its March 1, 1913, value, then, except as provided in paragraph (2), an increase (properly reflecting such difference) shall be made in that part of the earnings and profits consisting of increase in value of property accrued before March 1, 1913.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If the application of subsection (f) to a sale or other disposition after February 28, 1913, results in a loss which is to be applied in decrease of earnings and profits for any period beginning after February 28, 1913, then, notwithstanding subsection (f) and in lieu of the rule provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the amount of such loss so to be applied shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which the adjusted basis of the property used in determining the loss exceeds the adjusted basis computed without regard to the value of the property on March 1, 1913, and if such amount so applied in reduction of the decrease exceeds such loss, the excess over such loss shall increase that part of the earnings and profits consisting of increase in value of property accrued before March 1, 1913.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Allocation in certain corporate separations and reorganizations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Section 355</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a reorganization described in subparagraph (C) or (D) of section 368(a)(1), proper allocation with respect to the earnings and profits of the acquired corporation shall, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, be made between the acquiring corporation and the acquired corporation (or any corporation which had control of the acquired corporation before the reorganization).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Distribution of proceeds of loan insured by the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a corporation distributes property with respect to its stock and if, at the time of distribution&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is outstanding a loan to such corporation which was made, guaranteed, or insured by the United States (or by any agency or instrumentality thereof), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of such loan so outstanding exceeds the adjusted basis of the property constituting security for such loan,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the earnings and profits of the corporation shall be increased by the amount of such excess, and (immediately after the distribution) shall be decreased by the amount of such excess. For purposes of paragraph (2), the adjusted basis of the property at the time of distribution shall be determined without regard to any adjustment under section 1016(a)(2) (relating to adjustment for depreciation, etc.). For purposes of this subsection, a commitment to make, guarantee, or insure a loan shall be treated as the making, guaranteeing, or insuring of a loan.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Allocation within affiliated group</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If for any taxable year a method of depreciation was used by the taxpayer which the Secretary has determined results in a reasonable allowance under section 167(a) and which is the unit-of-production method or other method not expressed in a term of years, then the adjustment to earnings and profits for depreciation for such year shall be determined under the method so used (in lieu of the straight line method).</p>
