<p class="statutory-body">In the case of the death of a taxpayer whose taxable income is computed under an accrual method of accounting, any amount accrued only by reason of the death of the taxpayer shall not be included in computing taxable income for the period in which falls the date of the taxpayer's death.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount realized, in the case of satisfaction at other than face value or a sale or exchange, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the fair market value of the obligation at the time of distribution, transmission, or dis<!-- PDFPage:1341 -->position, in the case of the distribution, transmission, or disposition otherwise than by sale or exchange.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">any gain or loss so resulting shall be considered as resulting from the sale or exchange of the property in respect of which the installment obligation was received.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Basis of obligation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The basis of an installment obligation shall be the excess of the face value of the obligation over an amount equal to the income which would be returnable were the obligation satisfied in full.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rule for transmission at death</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in section 691 (relating to recipients of income in respect of decedents), this section shall not apply to the transmission of installment obligations at death.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a disposition of an installment obligation by any person other than a life insurance company (as defined in section 816(a)) to such an insurance company or to a partnership of which such an insurance company is a partner, no provision of this subtitle providing for the nonrecognition of gain shall apply with respect to any gain resulting under subsection (a). If a corporation which is a life insurance company for the taxable year was (for the preceding taxable year) a corporation which was not a life insurance company, such corporation shall, for purposes of this subsection and subsection (a), be treated as having transferred to a life insurance company, on the last day of the preceding taxable year, all installment obligations which it held on such last day. A partnership of which a life insurance company becomes a partner shall, for purposes of this subsection and subsection (a), be treated as having transferred to a life insurance company, on the last day of the preceding taxable year of such partnership, all installment obligations which it holds at the time such insurance company becomes a partner.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule where life insurance company elects to treat income as not related to insurance business</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any transfer or deemed transfer of an installment obligation if the life insurance company elects (at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe) to determine its life insurance company taxable income&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by returning the income on such installment obligation under the installment method prescribed in section 453, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as if such income were an item attributable to a noninsurance business (as defined in section 806(b)(3)).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Obligation becomes unenforceable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, if any installment obligation is canceled or otherwise becomes unenforceable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the obligation shall be treated as if it were disposed of in a transaction other than a sale or exchange, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the obligor and obligee are related persons (within the meaning of section 453(f)(1)), the fair market value of the obligation shall be treated as not less than its face amount.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Transfers between spouses or incident to divorce</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any transfer described in subsection (a) of section 1041 (other than a transfer in trust)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) subsection (a) of this section shall not apply, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the same tax treatment with respect to the transferred installment obligation shall apply to the transferee as would have applied to the transferor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Certain liquidating distributions by S corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an installment obligation is distributed by an S corporation in a complete liquidation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) receipt of the obligation is not treated as payment for the stock by reason of section 453(h)(1),</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirement that percentage of completion method be used</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any long-term contract, the taxable income from such contract shall be determined under the percentage of completion method (as modified by subsection (b)).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Percentage of completion method</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirements of percentage of completion method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (3), in the case of any long-term contract with respect to which the percentage of completion method is used&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the percentage of completion shall be determined by comparing costs allocated to the contract under subsection (c) and incurred before the close of the taxable year with the estimated total contract costs, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) upon completion of the contract (or, with respect to any amount properly taken into account after completion of the contract, when such amount is so properly taken into account), the taxpayer shall pay (or shall be entitled to receive) interest computed under the look-back method of paragraph (2).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In the case of any long-term contract with respect to which the percentage of completion method is used, except for purposes of applying the look-back method of paragraph (2), any income under the contract (to the extent not previously includible in gross income) shall be included in gross income for the taxable year following the taxable year in which the contract was completed. For purposes of subtitle F (other than sections 6654 and 6655), any interest required to be paid by the taxpayer under subparagraph (B) shall be treated as an increase in the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the contract is completed (or, in the case of interest payable with respect to any amount properly taken into account after completion of the contract, for the taxable year in which the amount is so properly taken into account).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Look-back method</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) second, determining (solely for purposes of computing such interest) the overpayment or underpayment of tax for each taxable year referred to in subparagraph (A) <!-- PDFPage:1359 -->which would result solely from the application of subparagraph (A), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) then using the adjusted overpayment rate (as defined in paragraph (7)), compounded daily, on the overpayment or underpayment determined under subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of the preceding sentence, any amount properly taken into account after completion of the contract shall be taken into account by discounting (using the Federal mid-term rate determined under section 1274(d) as of the time such amount was properly taken into account) such amount to its value as of the completion of the contract. The taxpayer may elect with respect to any contract to have the preceding sentence not apply to such contract.</p>
