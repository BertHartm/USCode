<p class="italic-text-para">(1) Section 1(g) provides that the tax on the net unearned income of a child under the age of 14 is computed at the marginal rate of the child's parent. Under &sect;1(g)(4)(A)(ii), net unearned income generally equals unearned income less the sum of (I) the amount in effect for the tax year under &sect;63(c)(5)(A), plus (II) the greater of the amount described in (I) or certain itemized deductions.</p>
<p class="italic-text-para">(2) The amount in effect for tax years beginning in 1995 under &sect;63(c)(5)(A) is $650. See section 3.04(2) below. Accordingly, for tax years beginning in 1995 net unearned income will generally equal unearned income less the greater of $1,300 or $650 plus certain itemized deductions.</p>
<h4 class="italic-text-head">.03 Earned income tax credit</h4>
<p class="italic-text-para">(1) Section 32(a)(1) provides an earned income tax credit amount for certain taxpayers with one child, two or more children, or no children.

<p class="italic-text-para">(3) Under &sect;63(f) for tax years beginning in 1995, the additional standard deduction amounts for the aged and for the blind are $750 for each. These amounts are each increased to $950 if the individual is also unmarried and not a surviving spouse.</p>
<h4 class="italic-text-head">.05 Overall limitation on itemized deductions.</h4>
<p class="italic-text-para">(1) Section 68 provides that the amount of itemized deductions otherwise allowable for the tax year shall be reduced by the lesser of (1) 3 percent of the excess of adjusted gross income over the &ldquo;applicable amount,&rdquo; or (2) 80 percent of the amount of certain itemized deductions otherwise allowable for the tax year.</p>
<p class="italic-text-para">(2) The &ldquo;applicable amount&rdquo; for tax years beginning in 1995 is $114,700 ($57,350 in the case of a separate return by a married individual within the meaning of &sect;7703).</p>

<p class="italic-text-para">(1) Section 132(f) provides an exclusion from gross income for certain employer-provided transportation referred to as a &ldquo;qualified transportation fringe.&rdquo; A &ldquo;qualified transportation fringe&rdquo; means any of the following: transportation in a commuter highway vehicle between the employee's residence and place of employment, any transit pass, and qualified parking. Section 132(f)(2)(A) limits the exclusion for the aggregate of the transportation in a commuter highway vehicle and the transit pass to $60 per month (the &ldquo;$60 vehicle/transit&rdquo; limitation). Section 132(f)(2)(B) limits the exclusion for qualified parking to $155 per month (the &ldquo;$155 parking&rdquo; limitation).</p>
<p class="italic-text-para">(2) For tax years beginning in 1995, the &ldquo;$60 vehicle/transit&rdquo; limitation is $60 and the &ldquo;$155 parking&rdquo; limitation is $160.</p>

<p class="italic-text-para">(1) Section 135 provides an exclusion of income from the redemption of United States savings bonds for taxpayers who pay qualified higher education expenses. Section 135(b)(2) provides for the phaseout of the exclusion. The amount of the reduction in the exclusion caused by the phaseout is calculated by multiplying the amount otherwise excludable by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the excess of the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income over the threshold amount ($60,000 for joint returns or $40,000 for others) and the denominator is $30,000 for joint returns or $15,000 for others.</p>

<p class="italic-text-para">(2) Section 151(d)(3) provides for the phaseout of the tax benefit of the personal exemptions allowed by &sect;151.

<p class="italic-text-para">(1) Section 513(h)(1)(A) provides that, in the case of certain exempt organizations, the term &ldquo;unrelated business income&rdquo; does not include activities relating to the distribution of &ldquo;low cost articles&rdquo; (as defined in &sect;513(h)(2)) if the distribution of such articles is incidental to the solicitation of charitable contributions.</p>
<p class="italic-text-para">(2) Section 3 of Rev. Proc. 90&ndash;12, 1990&ndash;1 C.B. 471, as amplified by Rev. Proc. 92&ndash;49, 1992&ndash;1 C.B. 987, and as modified by Rev. Proc. 92&ndash;102, 1992&ndash;2 C.B. 579, provides guidelines for determining the deductible amount of contributions under &sect;170 when the contributors receive something in return for their contributions. The guidelines provide that insubstantial benefits received by the contributor (in the context of a charitable fund-raising campaign) are disregarded, which makes the contribution fully deductible under &sect;170. The guidelines further provide the following three alternative limitations on what are insubstantial benefits:</p>

<p class="italic-text-para">.01 Section 1(f)(1) provides that not later than December 15 of each calendar year, the Secretary shall prescribe inflation-adjusted tax rate tables that apply in lieu of the tax rate tables in &sect;1 with respect to tax years beginning in the succeeding calendar year.</p>
<p class="italic-text-para">Under &sect;1(f)(3), the inflation adjustment for a calendar year is the percentage (if any) by which the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the preceding calendar year exceeds the CPI for the calendar year 1992. However, &sect;1(f)(7)(A) provides that in prescribing the inflation adjustments for the 36 percent and 39.6 percent tax rate brackets, the preceding calendar year's CPI is compared with the CPI for the <!-- PDFPage:30 -->calendar year 1993. For purposes of computing the inflation adjustment, &sect;1(f)(4) defines the CPI as the average of the 12 monthly CPIs for the 12-month period ending on August 31 of such calendar year. Under &sect;1(f)(5), the CPI is that for all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.</p>
<p class="italic-text-para">Section 1(f)(2)(A) provides that the inflation adjustment is reflected in the tax rate tables by increasing the minimum and maximum dollar amounts for each rate bracket.

<p class="italic-text-para">.02 Section 1(g)(4) uses the limitation on the standard deduction for certain dependents under &sect;63(c)(5)(A) in computing the &ldquo;kiddie tax.&rdquo; That limitation is adjusted for inflation under &sect;63(c)(4). The inflation adjustment computation under &sect;63(c)(4) is described below in section 4.04.</p>
<p class="italic-text-para">.03 Section 32(i) provides that the &ldquo;earned income amounts&rdquo; and &ldquo;phaseout amounts,&rdquo; which limit the earned income tax credit, are adjusted for inflation under the method described in &sect;1(f)(3), except that the preceding calendar year's CPI is compared with the CPI for the calendar year 1993.

Under &sect;1(f)(6), the adjusted &ldquo;applicable amount&rdquo; is &ldquo;rounded down&rdquo; to the nearest multiple of $50 ($25 in the case of married individuals filing separately).</p>
<p class="italic-text-para">.06 Section 132(f) provides that the limitation on the amount of the exclusion from gross income for a qualified transportation fringe is adjusted for inflation under the method described in &sect;1(f)(3).

<p class="italic-text-para">.07 Section 135(b)(2)(B) provides that the dollar amount at which the phaseout of the exclusion (of income from the redemption of United States savings bonds for taxpayers who pay qualified higher education expenses) begins is adjusted for inflation under the method described in &sect;1(f)(3). The preceding calendar year's CPI is compared with the CPI for the calendar year 1992. The adjusted dollar amount is rounded to the nearest multiple of $50 (if the adjusted figure is a multiple of $25, it is increased to the next highest multiple of $50) under &sect;135(b)(2)(C).</p>
<p class="italic-text-para">.08 Section 151(d)(4)(A) provides that the personal exemption amount is adjusted for inflation under the method described in &sect;1(f)(3), except that the preceding calendar year's CPI is compared with the CPI for the calendar year 1988.

Under &sect;1(f)(6), an adjusted &ldquo;threshold amount&rdquo; is &ldquo;rounded down&rdquo; to the nearest multiple of $50 ($25 in the case of married individuals filing separately).</p>
<p class="italic-text-para">.09 Section 513(h)(2)(C) provides that the maximum cost of a &ldquo;low cost article&rdquo; is adjusted for inflation under the method described in &sect;1(f)(3), except that the preceding calendar year's CPI is compared with the CPI for the calendar year 1987.</p>
<p class="italic-text-para">Rev.

The &ldquo;$50 benefit&rdquo; limitation in that revenue procedure is adjusted in the same manner.</p>
<p class="italic-text-para">.10 Section 4001(e) provides that the &ldquo;$30,000 amount&rdquo; threshold for the excise tax on a luxury automobile in &sect;&sect;4001(a) and 4003(a) is adjusted for inflation. The adjustment, before rounding, is the excess of (A) the &ldquo;$30,000 amount&rdquo; increased by the method described in &sect;1(f)(3), except that the preceding calendar year's CPI is compared with the CPI for the calendar year 1990, over (B) the dollar amount in effect under &sect;4001(a) for the calendar year. Under &sect;4001(e)(1)(B) the adjusted &ldquo;$30,000 amount&rdquo; is &ldquo;rounded down&rdquo; to the nearest multiple of $2,000.</p>
<p class="italic-text-para">Section 4001(e)(1) further provides that the adjusted and rounded amount shall apply to the calendar year subsequent to the year on which the cost of living calculations are based. This means that the inflation adjustment factor for the $30,000 amount for tax years beginning in 1995 is computed by comparing the CPI for calendar year 1993 with the CPI for the calendar year 1990.</p>
