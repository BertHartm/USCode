<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any payment of any tax described in section 6212(a) to the extent that any unreasonable error or delay in such payment is attributable to such an officer or employee being erroneous or dilatory in performing a ministerial or managerial act,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the Secretary may abate the assessment of all or any part of such interest for any period. For purposes of the preceding sentence, an error or delay shall be taken into account only if no significant aspect of such error or delay can be attributed to the taxpayer involved, and after the Internal Revenue Service has contacted the taxpayer in writing with respect to such deficiency or payment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Interest abated with respect to erroneous refund check</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Suspension</h4>
