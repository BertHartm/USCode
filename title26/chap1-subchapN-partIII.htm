<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subtitle, in the case of taxes paid or accrued to any foreign country with respect to foreign oil related income, the term &ldquo;income, war profits, and excess profits taxes&rdquo; shall not include any amount paid or accrued after December 31, 1982, to the extent that the Secretary determines that the foreign law imposing such amount of tax is structured, or in fact operates, so that the amount of tax imposed with respect to foreign oil related income will generally be materially greater, over a reasonable period of time, than the amount generally imposed on income that is neither foreign oil related income nor foreign oil and gas extraction income. In computing the amount not treated as tax under this subsection, such amount shall be treated as a deduction under the foreign law.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Disregard of certain posted prices, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this chapter, in determining the amount of taxable income in the case of foreign oil and gas extraction income, if the oil or gas is disposed of, or is acquired other than from the government of a foreign country, at a posted price (or other pricing arrangement) which differs from the fair market value for such oil or gas, such fair market value shall be used in lieu of such posted price (or other pricing arrangement).</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subpart, the term &ldquo;subpart F income&rdquo; means, in the case of any controlled foreign corporation, the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) insurance income (as defined under section 953),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the income of such corporation other than income which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is attributable to earnings and profits of the foreign corporation included in the gross income of a United States person under section 951 (other than by reason of this paragraph), or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the income of such corporation derived from any foreign country during any period during which section 901(j) applies to such foreign country.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The payments referred to in paragraph (4) are payments which would be unlawful under the <!-- PDFPage:1743 -->Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 if the payor were a United States person. For purposes of paragraph (5), the income described therein shall be reduced, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, so as to take into account deductions (including taxes) properly allocable to such income.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exclusion of United States income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a controlled foreign corporation, subpart F income does not include any item of income from sources within the United States which is effectively connected with the conduct by such corporation of a trade or business within the United States unless such item is exempt from taxation (or is subject to a reduced rate of tax) pursuant to a treaty obligation of the United States. For purposes of the preceding sentence, income described in paragraph (2) or (3) of section 921(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#952_1_target" name="952_1">1</a></sup> shall be treated as derived from sources within the United States. For purposes of this subsection, any exemption (or reduction) with respect to the tax imposed by section 884 shall not be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Subpart F income limited to current earnings and profits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subsection (a), the subpart F income of any controlled foreign corporation for any taxable year shall not exceed the earnings and profits of such corporation for such taxable year.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The amount included in the gross income of any United States shareholder under section 951(a)(1)(A)(i) for any taxable year and attributable to a qualified activity shall be reduced by the amount of such shareholder's pro rata share of any qualified deficit.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Qualified deficit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The term &ldquo;qualified deficit&rdquo; means any deficit in earnings and profits of the controlled foreign corporation for any prior taxable year which began after December 31, 1986, and for which the controlled foreign corporation was a controlled foreign corporation; but only to the extent such deficit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is attributable to the same qualified activity as the activity giving rise to the income being offset, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) has not previously been taken into account under this subparagraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;In determining the deficit attributable to qualified activities described in subclause (II) or (III) of clause (iii), deficits in earnings and profits (to the extent not previously taken into account under this section) for taxable years beginning after 1962 and before 1987 also shall be taken into account. In the case of the qualified activity described in clause (iii)(I), the rule of the preceding sentence shall apply, except that &ldquo;1982&rdquo; shall be substituted for &ldquo;1962&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Qualified activity</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) in the case of a qualified insurance company, insurance income or foreign personal holding company income, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) in the case of a qualified financial institution, foreign personal holding company income.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Pro rata share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this paragraph, the shareholder's pro rata share of any deficit for any prior taxable year shall be determined under rules similar to rules under section 951(a)(2) for whichever of the following yields the smaller share:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the close of the taxable year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the close of the taxable year in which the deficit arose.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(v) Qualified insurance company</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;qualified insurance company&rdquo; means any controlled foreign corporation predominantly engaged in the active conduct of an insurance business in the taxable year and in the prior taxable years in which the deficit arose.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vi) Qualified financial institution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;qualified financial institution&rdquo; means any controlled foreign corporation predominantly engaged in the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business in the taxable year and in the prior taxable year in which the deficit arose.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vii) Special rules for insurance income</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">An election may be made under this clause to have section 953(a) applied for purposes of this title without regard to the same country exception under paragraph (1)(A) thereof. Such election, once made, may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Special rules for affiliated groups</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">In the case of an affiliated group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1504 but without regard to section 1504(b)(3) and by substituting &ldquo;more than 50 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;at least 80 percent&rdquo; each place it appears), no election may be made under subclause (I) for any controlled foreign corporation unless such election is made for all other controlled foreign corporations who are members of such group and who were created or organized under the laws of the same country as such controlled foreign corporation. For purposes of clause (v), in deter<!-- PDFPage:1744 -->mining whether any controlled corporation described in the preceding sentence is a qualified insurance company, all such corporations shall be treated as 1 corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Certain deficits of member of the same chain of corporations may be taken into account</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A controlled foreign corporation may elect to reduce the amount of its subpart F income for any taxable year which is attributable to any qualified activity by the amount of any deficit in earnings and profits of a qualified chain member for a taxable year ending with (or within) the taxable year of such controlled foreign corporation to the extent such deficit is attributable to such activity. To the extent any deficit reduces subpart F income under the preceding sentence, such deficit shall not be taken into account under subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Qualified chain member</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;qualified chain member&rdquo; means, with respect to any controlled foreign corporation, any other corporation which is created or organized under the laws of the same foreign country as the controlled foreign corporation but only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) all the stock of such other corporation (other than directors&rsquo; qualifying shares) is owned at all times during the taxable year in which the deficit arose (directly or through 1 or more corporations other than the common parent) by such controlled foreign corporation, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) all the stock of such controlled foreign corporation (other than directors&rsquo; qualifying shares) is owned at all times during the taxable year in which the deficit arose (directly or through 1 or more corporations other than the common parent) by such other corporation.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Coordination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">This subparagraph shall be applied after subparagraphs (A) and (B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Recharacterization in subsequent taxable years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the subpart F income of any controlled foreign corporation for any taxable year was reduced by reason of paragraph (1)(A), any excess of the earnings and profits of such corporation for any subsequent taxable year over the subpart F income of such foreign corporation for such taxable year shall be recharacterized as subpart F income under rules similar to the rules applicable under section 904(f)(5).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule for determining earnings and profits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, earnings and profits of any controlled foreign corporation shall be determined without regard to paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of section 312(n). Under regulations, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent it would increase earnings and profits by an amount which was previously distributed by the controlled foreign corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Income derived from foreign country</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of subsection (a)(5), including regulations which treat income paid through 1 or more entities as derived from a foreign country to which section 901(j) applies if such income was, without regard to such entities, derived from such country.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Deduction</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a corporation which is a United States shareholder and for which the election under this section is in effect for the taxable year, there shall be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to 85 percent of the cash dividends which are received during such taxable year by such shareholder from controlled foreign corporations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Dividends paid indirectly from controlled foreign corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, within the taxable year for which the election under this section is in effect, a United States shareholder receives a cash distribution from a controlled foreign corporation which is excluded from gross income under section 959(a), such distribution shall be treated for purposes of this section as a cash dividend to the extent of any amount included in income by such United States shareholder under section 951(a)(1)(A) as a result of any cash dividend during such taxable year to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such controlled foreign corporation from another controlled foreign corporation that is in a chain of ownership described in section 958(a), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any other controlled foreign corporation in such chain of ownership from another controlled foreign corporation in such chain of ownership, but only to the extent of cash distributions described in section 959(b) which are made during such taxable year to the controlled foreign corporation from which such United States shareholder received such distribution.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1779 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of dividends taken into account under subsection (a) shall not exceed the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) $500,000,000,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount shown on the applicable financial statement as earnings permanently reinvested outside the United States, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of an applicable financial statement which fails to show a specific amount of earnings permanently reinvested outside the United States and which shows a specific amount of tax liability attributable to such earnings, the amount equal to the amount of such liability divided by 0.35.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The amounts described in subparagraphs (B) and (C) shall be treated as being zero if there is no such statement or such statement fails to show a specific amount of such earnings or liability, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Dividends must be extraordinary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of dividends taken into account under subsection (a) shall not exceed the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the annual average for the base period years of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the dividends received during each base period year by such shareholder from controlled foreign corporations,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amounts includible in such shareholder's gross income for each base period year under section 951(a)(1)(B) with respect to controlled foreign corporations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the amounts that would have been included for each base period year but for section 959(a) with respect to controlled foreign corporations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The amount taken into account under clause (iii) for any base period year shall not include any amount which is not includible in gross income by reason of an amount described in clause (ii) with respect to a prior taxable year. Amounts described in subparagraph (B) for any base period year shall be such amounts as shown on the most recent return filed for such year; except that amended returns filed after June 30, 2003, shall not be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reduction of benefit if increase in related party indebtedness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of dividends which would (but for this paragraph) be taken into account under subsection (a) shall be reduced by the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of indebtedness of the controlled foreign corporation to any related person (as defined in section 954(d)(3)) as of the close of the taxable year for which the election under this section is in effect, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of indebtedness of the controlled foreign corporation to any related person (as so defined) as of the close of October 3, 2004.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">All controlled foreign corporations with respect to which the taxpayer is a United States shareholder shall be treated as 1 controlled foreign corporation for purposes of this paragraph. The Secretary may prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent the avoidance of the purposes of this paragraph, including regulations which provide that cash dividends shall not be taken into account under subsection (a) to the extent such dividends are attributable to the direct or indirect transfer (including through the use of intervening entities or capital contributions) of cash or other property from a related person (as so defined) to a controlled foreign corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Requirement to invest in United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (a) shall not apply to any dividend received by a United States shareholder unless the amount of the dividend is invested in the United States pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is approved by the taxpayer's president, chief executive officer, or comparable official before the payment of such dividend and subsequently approved by the taxpayer's board of directors, management committee, executive committee, or similar body, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provides for the reinvestment of such dividend in the United States (other than as payment for executive compensation), including as a source for the funding of worker hiring and training, infrastructure, research and development, capital investments, or the financial stabilization of the corporation for the purposes of job retention or creation.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Export trade income constituting foreign base company income</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957) which for the <!-- PDFPage:1782 -->taxable year is an export trade corporation, the subpart F income (determined without regard to this subpart) of such corporation for such year shall be reduced by an amount equal to so much of the export trade income (as defined in section 971(b)) of such corporation for such year as constitutes foreign base company income (as defined in section 954), but only to the extent that such amount does not exceed whichever of the following amounts is the lesser:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an amount equal to 11/2 times so much of the export promotion expenses (as defined in section 971(d)) of such corporation for such year as is probably allocable to the export trade income which constitutes foreign base company income of such corporation for such year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an amount equal to 10 percent of so much of the gross receipts for such year (or, in the case of gross receipts arising from commissions, fees, or other compensation for its services, so much of the gross amount upon the basis of which such commissions, fees, or other compensation is computed) accruing to such export trade corporation from the sale, installation, operation, maintenance, or use of property in respect of which such corporation derives export trade income as is properly allocable to the export trade income which constitutes foreign base company income of such corporation for such year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The allocations with respect to export trade income which constitutes foreign base company income under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Overall limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The reduction under paragraph (1) for any taxable year shall not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to the increase in the investments in export trade assets (as defined in section 971(c)) of such corporation for such year as the export trade income which constitutes foreign base company income of such corporation for such year bears to the entire export trade income of such corporation for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inclusion of certain previously excluded amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation which for any prior taxable year was an export trade corporation shall include in his gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A)(ii), as an amount to which section 955 (relating to withdrawal of previously excluded subpart F income from qualified investment) applies, his pro rata share of the amount of decrease in the investments in export trade assets of such corporation for such year, but only to the extent that his pro rata share of such amount does not exceed an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) his pro rata share of the sum of (A) the amounts by which the subpart F income of such corporation was reduced for all prior taxable years under subsection (a), and (B) the amounts not included in subpart F income (determined without regard to this subpart) for all prior taxable years by reason of the treatment (under section 972 as in effect before the date of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1976) of two or more controlled foreign corporations which are export trade corporations as a single controlled foreign corporation, reduced by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the sum of the amounts which were included in his gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A)(ii) under the provisions of this subsection for all prior taxable years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Investments in export trade assets</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amount of investments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the amount taken into account with respect to any export trade asset shall be its adjusted basis, reduced by any liability to which the asset is subject.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Increase in investments in export trade assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (a), the amount of increase in investments in export trade assets of any controlled foreign corporation for any taxable year is the amount by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of such investments at the close of the taxable year, exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of such investments at the close of the preceding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Decrease in investments in export trade assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (b), the amount of decrease in investments in export trade assets of any controlled foreign corporation for any taxable year is the amount by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of such investments at the close of the preceding taxable year (reduced by an amount equal to the amount of net loss sustained during the taxable year with respect to export trade assets), exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of such investments at the close of the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A United States shareholder of an export trade corporation may, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, make the determinations under paragraphs (2) and (3) as of the close of the 75th day after the close of the years referred to in such paragraphs in lieu of on the last day of such years. A United States shareholder of an export trade corporation may, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, make the determinations under paragraphs (2) and (3) with respect to export trade assets described in section 971(c)(3) as of the close of the years following the years referred to in such paragraphs, or as of the close of such longer period of time as such regulations may permit, in lieu of on the last day of such years and in lieu of on the day prescribed in the preceding sentence. Any election under this paragraph made with respect to any taxable year shall apply to such year and to all succeeding taxable years unless the Secretary consents to the revocation of such election.</p>

In any such proceeding, the Secretary may seek to compel compliance with such request.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The United States district court for the district in which the person (to whom the formal document request is mailed) resides or is found shall have jurisdiction to hear any proceeding brought under subparagraph (A). An order denying the petition shall be deemed a final order which may be appealed.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Suspension of 90-day period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The running of the 90-day period referred to in subsection (a) shall be suspended during any period during which a proceeding brought under subparagraph (A) is pending.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Foreign-based documentation</h4>
