<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the taxpayer has gain from a constructive ownership transaction with respect to any financial asset and such gain would (without regard to this section) be treated as a long-term capital gain&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such gain shall be treated as ordinary income to the extent that such gain exceeds the net underlying long-term capital gain, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the extent such gain is treated as a long-term capital gain after the application of paragraph (1), the determination of the capital gain rate (or rates) applicable to such gain under section 1(h) shall be determined on the basis of the respective rate (or rates) that would have been applicable to the net underlying long-term capital gain.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1849 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Interest charge on deferral of gain recognition</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any gain is treated as ordinary income for any taxable year by reason of subsection (a)(1), the tax imposed by this chapter for such taxable year shall be increased by the amount of interest determined under paragraph (2) with respect to each prior taxable year during any portion of which the constructive ownership transaction was open. Any amount payable under this paragraph shall be taken into account in computing the amount of any deduction allowable to the taxpayer for interest paid or accrued during such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of interest determined under this paragraph with respect to a prior taxable year is the amount of interest which would have been imposed under section 6601 on the underpayment of tax for such year which would have resulted if the gain (which is treated as ordinary income by reason of subsection (a)(1)) had been included in gross income in the taxable years in which it accrued (determined by treating the income as accruing at a constant rate equal to the applicable Federal rate as in effect on the day the transaction closed). The period during which such interest shall accrue shall end on the due date (without extensions) for the return of tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which such transaction closed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Applicable Federal rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (2), the applicable Federal rate is the applicable Federal rate determined under section 1274(d) (compounded semiannually) which would apply to a debt instrument with a term equal to the period the transaction was open.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) No credits against increase in tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any increase in tax under paragraph (1) shall not be treated as tax imposed by this chapter for purposes of determining&mdash;</p>
