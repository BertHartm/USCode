<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6242. Procedures for taking partnership adjustments into account</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Adjustments flow through to partners for year in which adjustment takes effect</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any partnership adjustment with respect to any partnership item takes effect (within <!-- PDFPage:2682 -->the meaning of subsection (d)(2)) during any partnership taxable year and if an election under paragraph (2) does not apply to such adjustment, such adjustment shall be taken into account in determining the amount of such item for the partnership taxable year in which such adjustment takes effect. In applying this title to any person who is (directly or indirectly) a partner in such partnership during such partnership taxable year, such adjustment shall be treated as an item actually arising during such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Partnership liable in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a partnership elects under this paragraph to not take an adjustment into account under paragraph (1),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a partnership does not make such an election but in filing its return for any partnership taxable year fails to take fully into account any partnership adjustment as required under paragraph (1), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any partnership adjustment involves a reduction in a credit which exceeds the amount of such credit determined for the partnership taxable year in which the adjustment takes effect,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the partnership shall pay to the Secretary an amount determined by applying the rules of subsection (b)(4) to the adjustments not so taken into account and any excess referred to in subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Offsetting adjustments taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a partnership adjustment requires another adjustment in a taxable year after the adjusted year and before the partnership taxable year in which such partnership adjustment takes effect, such other adjustment shall be taken into account under this subsection for the partnership taxable year in which such partnership adjustment takes effect.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Coordination with part II</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts taken into account under this subsection for any partnership taxable year shall continue to be treated as adjustments for the adjusted year for purposes of determining whether such amounts may be readjusted under part II.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Partnership liable for interest and penalties</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a partnership adjustment takes effect during any partnership taxable year and such adjustment results in an imputed underpayment for the adjusted year, the partnership&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall pay to the Secretary interest computed under paragraph (2), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall be liable for any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount as provided in paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of amount of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The interest computed under this paragraph with respect to any partnership adjustment is the interest which would be determined under chapter 67&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) on the imputed underpayment determined under paragraph (4) with respect to such adjustment,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for the period beginning on the day after the return due date for the adjusted year and ending on the return due date for the partnership taxable year in which such adjustment takes effect (or, if earlier, in the case of any adjustment to which subsection (a)(2) applies, the date on which the payment under subsection (a)(2) is made).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Proper adjustments in the amount determined under the preceding sentence shall be made for adjustments required for partnership taxable years after the adjusted year and before the year in which the partnership adjustment takes effect by reason of such partnership adjustment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A partnership shall be liable for any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount for which it would have been liable if such partnership had been an individual subject to tax under chapter 1 for the adjusted year and the imputed underpayment determined under paragraph (4) were an actual underpayment (or understatement) for such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Imputed underpayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the imputed underpayment determined under this paragraph with respect to any partnership adjustment is the underpayment (if any) which would result&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by netting all adjustments to items of income, gain, loss, or deduction and by treating any net increase in income as an underpayment equal to the amount of such net increase multiplied by the highest rate of tax in effect under section 1 or 11 for the adjusted year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by taking adjustments to credits into account as increases or decreases (whichever is appropriate) in the amount of tax.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of the preceding sentence, any net decrease in a loss shall be treated as an increase in income and a similar rule shall apply to a net increase in a loss.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Administrative provisions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any payment required by subsection (a)(2) or (b)(1)(A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as if it were a tax imposed by subtitle C, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall be paid on or before the return due date for the partnership taxable year in which the partnership adjustment takes effect.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of determining interest, any payment required by subsection (a)(2) or (b)(1)(A) shall be treated as an underpayment of tax.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Penalties</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any failure by any partnership to pay on the date prescribed therefor any amount required by subsection (a)(2) or (b)(1)(A), there is hereby imposed on such <!-- PDFPage:2683 -->partnership a penalty of 10 percent of the underpayment. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;underpayment&rdquo; means the excess of any payment required under this section over the amount (if any) paid on or before the date prescribed therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Accuracy-related and fraud penalties made applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of part II of subchapter A of chapter 68, any payment required by subsection (a)(2) shall be treated as an underpayment of tax.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definitions and special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Partnership adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;partnership adjustment&rdquo; means any adjustment in the amount of any partnership item of an electing large partnership.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) When adjustment takes effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A partnership adjustment takes effect&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of an adjustment pursuant to the decision of a court in a proceeding brought under part II, when such decision becomes final,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of an adjustment pursuant to any administrative adjustment request under section 6251, when such adjustment is allowed by the Secretary, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in any other case, when such adjustment is made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adjusted year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;adjusted year&rdquo; means the partnership taxable year to which the item being adjusted relates.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Return due date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;return due date&rdquo; means, with respect to any taxable year, the date prescribed for filing the partnership return for such taxable year (determined without regard to extensions).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Adjustments involving changes in character</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no adjustment to any partnership item may be made (and no levy or proceeding in any court for the collection of any amount resulting from such adjustment may be made, begun or prosecuted) before&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the close of the 90th day after the day on which a notice of a partnership adjustment was mailed to the partnership, and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Premature action may be enjoined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding section 7421(a), any action which violates subsection (a) may be enjoined in the proper court, including the Tax Court.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 90 days after the date on which a notice of a partnership adjustment is mailed to the partnership with respect to any partnership taxable year, the partnership may file a petition for a readjustment of the partnership items for such taxable year with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Tax Court,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the district court of the United States for the district in which the partnership's principal place of business is located, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Claims Court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Jurisdictional requirement for bringing action in district court or Claims Court</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A readjustment petition under this section may be filed in a district court of the United States or the Claims Court only if the partnership filing the petition deposits with the Secretary, on or before the date the petition is filed, the amount for which the partnership would be liable under section 6242(b) (as of the date of the filing of the petition) if the partnership items were adjusted as provided by the notice of partnership adjustment. The court may by order provide that the jurisdictional requirements of this paragraph are satisfied where there has been a good faith attempt to satisfy such requirement and any shortfall of the amount required to be deposited is timely corrected.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Interest payable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any amount deposited under paragraph (1), while deposited, shall not be treated as a payment of tax for purposes of this title (other than chapter 67).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Scope of judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A court with which a petition is filed in accordance with this section shall have jurisdiction to determine all partnership items of the partnership for the partnership taxable year to which the notice of partnership adjustment relates and the proper allocation of such items among the partners (and the applicability of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount <!-- PDFPage:2685 -->for which the partnership may be liable under section 6242(b)).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of court reviewable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any determination by a court under this section shall have the force and effect of a decision of the Tax Court or a final judgment or decree of the district court or the Claims Court, as the case may be, and shall be reviewable as such. The date of any such determination shall be treated as being the date of the court's order entering the decision.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect of decision dismissing action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an action brought under this section is dismissed other than by reason of a rescission under section 6245(b)(3), the decision of the court dismissing the action shall be considered as its decision that the notice of partnership adjustment is correct, and an appropriate order shall be entered in the records of the court.</p>
