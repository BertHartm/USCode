<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Appropriations where unfunded liability</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Each judge electing under subsection (b) shall deposit, with interest at 4 percent per annum to <!-- PDFPage:3001 -->December 31, 1947, and 3 percent per annum thereafter, compounded on December 31 of each year, to the credit of the survivors annuity fund, a sum equal to 3.5 percent of his judge's salary and of his basic salary, pay, or compensation for service as a Senator, Representative, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner in Congress, and for any other civilian service within the purview of section 8332 of title 5 of the United States Code. Each such judge may elect to make such deposits in installments during the continuance of his service as a judge in such amount and under such conditions as may be determined in each instance by the chief judge. Notwithstanding the failure of a judge to make such deposit, credit shall be allowed for the service rendered, but the annuity of the surviving spouse of such judge shall be reduced by an amount equal to 10 percent of the amount of such deposit, computed as of the date of the death of such judge, unless such surviving spouse shall elect to eliminate such service entirely from credit under subsection (n), except that no deposit shall be required from a judge for any year with respect to which deductions from his salary were actually made under the civil service retirement laws and no deposit shall be required for any honorable service in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard of the United States.</p>

The income derived from such investments shall constitute a part of said fund for the purpose of paying annuities and of carrying out the provisions of subsections (g), (h), and (j).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Crediting of deposits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount deposited by or deducted and withheld from the salary of each judge electing to bring himself within the purview of this section for credit to the survivors annuity fund shall be credited to an individual account of such judge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the service of any judge electing under subsection (b) terminates other than pursuant to the provisions of section 7447 or other than pursuant to section 1106 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or if any judge ceases to be married after making the election under subsection (b) and revokes (in a writing filed as provided in subsection (b)) such election, the amount credited to his individual account, together with interest at 4 percent per annum to December 31, 1947, and 3 percent per annum thereafter, compounded on December 31 of each year, to the date of his relinquishment of office, shall be returned to him. For the purpose of this section, the service of any judge electing under subsection (b) who is not reappointed following expiration of his term but who, at the time of such expiration, is eligible for and elects to receive retired pay under section 7447 shall be deemed to have terminated pursuant to said section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Entitlement to annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In case any judge electing under subsection (b) shall die while a judge after having rendered at least 5 years of civilian service computed as prescribed in subsection (n), for the last 5 years of which the salary deductions provided for by subsection (c)(1) or the deposits required by subsection (d) have actually been made or the salary deductions required by the civil service retirement laws have actually been made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if such judge is survived by a surviving spouse but not by a dependent child, there shall be paid to such surviving spouse an annuity beginning with the day of the death of the judge or following the surviving spouse's attainment of the age of 50 years, whichever is the later, in an amount computed as provided in subsection (m); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if such judge is survived by a surviving spouse and a dependent child or children, there shall be paid to such surviving spouse an immediate annuity in an amount computed as provided in subsection (m), and there shall also be paid to or on behalf of each such child an immediate annuity equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 10 percent of the average annual salary of such judge (determined in accordance with subsection (m)), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 20 percent of such average annual salary, divided by the number of such children; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if such judge leaves no surviving spouse but leaves a surviving dependent child or children, there shall be paid to or on behalf of each such child an immediate annuity equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 20 percent of the average annual salary of such judge (determined in accordance with subsection (m)), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 40 percent of such average annual salary, divided by the number of such children.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The annuity payable to a surviving spouse under this subsection shall be terminable upon such surviving spouse's death or such surviving spouse's remarriage before attaining age 55. The annuity payable to a child under this subsection shall be terminable upon (A) his attaining the age of 18 years, (B) his marriage, or (C) his death, whichever first occurs, except that if such child is incapable of self-support by reason of mental or physical disability his annuity shall be terminable only upon death, marriage, or recovery from such disability. In case of the death of a surviving spouse of a judge leaving a dependent child or children of the judge surviving such spouse, the annuity of such child or children shall be recomputed and paid as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection. In any case in which the annuity of a dependent child is terminated under this subsection, the annuities of any remaining dependent child or children, based upon the service of the same judge, shall be recomputed and paid as though the child whose annuity was so terminated had not survived such judge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Determination of dependency and disability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Questions of dependency and disability arising under this section shall be determined by the chief judge subject to review only by the Tax <!-- PDFPage:3002 -->Court, the decision of which shall be final and conclusive. The chief judge may order or direct at any time such medical or other examinations as he shall deem necessary to determine the facts relative to the nature and degree of disability of any dependent child who is an annuitant or applicant for annuity under this section, and may suspend or deny any such annuity for failure to submit to any examination so ordered or directed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Payments in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any case in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a judge electing under subsection (b) shall die while in office (whether in regular active service or retired from such service under section 7447), before having rendered 5 years of civilian service computed as prescribed in subsection (n), or after having rendered 5 years of such civilian service but without a survivor or survivors entitled to annuity benefits provided by subsection (h), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the right of all persons entitled to annuity under subsection (h) based on the service of such judge shall terminate before a valid claim therefor shall have been established,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the total amount credited to the individual account of such judge, with interest at 4 percent per annum to December 31, 1947, and 3 percent per annum thereafter, compounded on December 31 of each year, to the date of the death of such judge, shall be paid, upon the establishment of a valid claim therefor, to the person or persons surviving at the date title to the payment arises, in the following order of precedence, and such payment shall be a bar to recovery by any other person:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to the beneficiary or beneficiaries whom the judge may have designated by a writing filed prior to his death with the chief judge, except that in the case of the chief judge such designation shall be by a writing filed by him, prior to his death, as prescribed by the Tax Court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if there be no such beneficiary, to the surviving spouse of such judge;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) if none of the above, to the child or children of such judge and the descendents of any deceased children by representation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) if none of the above, to the parents of such judge or the survivor of them;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) if none of the above, to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of such judge; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) if none of the above, to such other next of kin of such judge as may be determined by the chief judge to be entitled under the laws of the domicile of such judge at the time of his death.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Determination as to the surviving spouse, child, or parent of a judge for the purposes of this paragraph shall be made by the chief judge without regard to the definitions in subsections (a)(6) and (7).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which the annuities of all persons entitled to annuity based upon the service of a judge shall terminate before the aggregate amount of annuity paid equals the total amount credited to the individual account of such judge, with interest at 4 percent per annum to December 31, 1947, and 3 percent per annum thereafter, compounded on December 31 of each year, to the date of the death of such judge, the difference shall be paid, upon establishment of a valid claim therefor, in the order of precedence prescribed in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any accrued annuity remaining unpaid upon the termination (other than by death) of the annuity of any person based upon the service of a judge shall be paid to such person. Any accrued annuity remaining unpaid upon the death of any person receiving annuity based upon the service of a judge shall be paid, upon the establishment of a valid claim therefor, in the following order of precedence:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of such person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if there is no such executor or administrator payment may be made, after the expiration of thirty days from the date of the death of such person, to such individual or individuals as may appear in the judgment of the chief judge to be legally entitled thereto, and such payment shall be a bar to recovery by any other individual.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Payments to persons under legal disability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where any payment under this section is to be made to a minor, or to a person mentally incompetent or under other legal disability adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, such payment may be made to the person who is constituted guardian or other fiduciary by the law of the State of residence of such claimant or is otherwise legally vested with the care of the claimant or his estate. Where no guardian or other fiduciary of the person under legal disability has been appointed under the laws of the State of residence of the claimant, the chief judge shall determine the person who is otherwise legally vested with the care of the claimant or his estate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Method of payment of annuities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Annuities granted under the terms of this section shall accrue monthly and shall be due and payable in monthly installments on the first business day of the month following the month or other period for which the annuity shall have accrued. None of the moneys mentioned in this section shall be assignable, either in law or in equity, or subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Computation of annuities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The annuity of the surviving spouse of a judge electing under subsection (b) shall be an amount equal to the sum of 1.5 percent of the average annual salary (whether judge's salary or compensation for other allowable service) received by such judge for judicial service (including periods in which he received retired pay under section 7447(d)) or for any other prior allowable service during the period of 3 consecutive years in which he received the largest such average annual salary, multiplied by the sum of his years of such judicial service, his years of prior allowable service as a Senator, Representative, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner in Congress, his years of prior allowable service performed as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States, and his years, not exceeding 15, of <!-- PDFPage:3003 -->prior allowable service performed as a congressional employee (as defined in section 2107 of title 5 of the United States Code,<sup><a href="#7448_1_target" name="7448_1">1</a></sup> and (2) three-fourths of 1 percent of such average annual salary multiplied by his years of any other prior allowable service, except that such annuity shall not exceed an amount equal to 50 percent of such average annual salary, nor be less than an amount equal to 25 percent of such average annual salary, and shall be further reduced in accordance with subsection (d) (if applicable). In determining the period of 3 consecutive years referred to in the preceding sentence, there may not be taken into account any period for which an election under section 7447(f)(4) is in effect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Includible service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the provisions of subsection (d), the years of service of a judge which are allowable as the basis for calculating the amount of the annuity of his surviving spouse shall include his years of service as a member of the United States Board of Tax Appeals, as a judge of the Tax Court of the United States, and as a judge of the Tax Court, his years of service as a Senator, Representative, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner in Congress, his years of active service as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States not exceeding 5 years in the aggregate and not including any such service for which credit is allowed for the purposes of retirement or retired pay under any other provision of law, and his years of any other civilian service within the purview of section 8332 of title 5 of the United States Code.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Simultaneous entitlement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prevent a surviving spouse eligible therefor from simultaneously receiving an annuity under this section and any annuity to which such spouse would otherwise be entitled under any other law without regard to this section, but in computing such other annuity service used in the computation of such spouse's annuity under this section shall not be credited.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(p) Estimates of expenditures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The chief judge shall submit to the President annual estimates of the expenditures and appropriations necessary for the maintenance and operation of the survivors annuity fund, and such supplemental and deficiency estimates as may be required from time to time for the same purposes, according to law. The chief judge shall cause periodic examinations of the survivors annuity fund to be made by an actuary, who may be an actuary employed by another department of the Government temporarily assigned for the purpose, and whose findings and recommendations shall be transmitted by the chief judge to the Tax Court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(q) Transitional provision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a judge who dies within 6 months after the date of enactment of this section after having rendered at least 5 years of civilian service computed as prescribed in subsection (n), but without having made an election as provided in subsection (b), an annuity shall be paid to his surviving spouse and surviving dependents as is provided in this section, as if such judge had elected on the day of his death to bring himself within the purview of this section but had not made the deposit provided for by subsection (d). An annuity shall be payable under this section computed upon the basis of the actual length of service as a judge and other allowable service of the judge and subject to the reduction required by subsection (d) even though no deposit has been made, as required by subsection (h) with respect to any of such service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(r) Waiver of civil service benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any judge electing under subsection (b) shall, at the time of such election, waive all benefits under the civil service retirement laws. Such a waiver shall be made in the same manner and shall have the same force and effect as an election filed under section 7447(e).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(s) Increases attributable to increased pay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the salary of a judge under section 7443(c) is increased, each annuity payable from the survivors annuity fund which is based, in whole or in part, upon a deceased judge having rendered some portion of his or her final 18 months of service as a judge of the Tax Court, shall also be increased. The amount of the increase in such an annuity shall be determined by multiplying the amount of the annuity, on the date on which the increase in salary becomes effective, by 3 percent for each full 5 percent by which such salary has been increased.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(t) Authorization of appropriation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Funds necessary to carry out the provisions of this section may be appropriated out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inclusion of findings of fact or opinions in report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the duty of the Tax Court and of each division to include in its report upon any proceeding its findings of fact or opinion or memorandum opinion. The Tax Court shall report in writing all its findings of fact, opinions, and memorandum opinions. Subject to such conditions as the Tax Court may by rule provide, the requirements of this subsection and of section 7460 are met if findings of fact or opinion are stated orally and recorded in the transcript of the proceedings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Date of decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A decision of the Tax Court (except a decision dismissing a proceeding for lack of jurisdiction) shall be held to be rendered upon the date that an order specifying the amount of the deficiency is entered in the records of the Tax Court or, in the case of a declaratory judgment proceeding under part IV of this subchapter or under section 7428 or in the case of an action brought under section 6226, 6228(a),<sup><a href="#7459_1_target" name="7459_1">1</a></sup> 6247, or 6252, the date of the court's order entering the decision.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effect of decision dismissing petition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a petition for a redetermination of a deficiency has been filed by the taxpayer, a decision of the Tax Court dismissing the proceeding shall be considered as its decision that the deficiency is the amount determined by the Secretary.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">at the option of the taxpayer concurred in by the Tax Court or a division thereof before the hearing of the case, proceedings in the case shall be conducted under this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 7453, such proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with such rules of evidence, practice, and procedure as the Tax Court may prescribe. A decision, together with a brief summary of the reasons therefor, in any such case shall satisfy the requirements of sections 7459(b) and 7460.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Finality of decisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A decision entered in any case in which the proceedings are conducted under this section <!-- PDFPage:3012 -->shall not be reviewed in any other court and shall not be treated as a precedent for any other case.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Discontinuance of proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At any time before a decision entered in a case in which the proceedings are conducted under this section becomes final, the taxpayer or the Secretary may request that further proceedings under this section in such case be discontinued. The Tax Court, or the division thereof hearing such case, may, if it finds that (1) there are reasonable grounds for believing that the amount of the deficiency placed in dispute, or the amount of an overpayment, exceeds the applicable jurisdictional amount described in subsection (a), and (2) the amount of such excess is large enough to justify granting such request, discontinue further proceedings in such case under this section. Upon any such discontinuance, proceedings in such case shall be conducted in the same manner as cases to which the provisions of sections 6214(a) and 6512(b) apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amount of deficiency in dispute</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the amount of any deficiency placed in dispute includes additions to the tax, additional amounts, and penalties imposed by chapter 68, to the extent that the procedures described in subchapter B of chapter 63 apply.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7476. Declaratory judgments relating to qualification of certain retirement plans</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Creation of remedy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In a case of actual controversy involving&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a determination by the Secretary with respect to the initial qualification or continuing qualification of a retirement plan under subchapter D of chapter 1, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a failure by the Secretary to make a determination with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such initial qualification, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such continuing qualification if the controversy arises from a plan amendment or plan termination,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, the Tax Court may make a declaration with respect <!-- PDFPage:3015 -->to such initial qualification or continuing qualification. Any such declaration shall have the force and effect of a decision of the Tax Court and shall be reviewable as such. For purposes of this section, a determination with respect to a continuing qualification includes any revocation of or other change in a qualification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Petitioner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A pleading may be filed under this section only by a petitioner who is the employer, the plan administrator, an employee who has qualified under regulations prescribed by the Secretary as an interested party for purposes of pursuing administrative remedies within the Internal Revenue Service, or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the filing of a pleading by any petitioner may be held by the Tax Court to be premature, unless the petitioner establishes to the satisfaction of the court that he has complied with the requirements prescribed by regulations of the Secretary with respect to notice to other interested parties of the filing of the request for a determination referred to in subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exhaustion of administrative remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Tax Court shall not issue a declaratory judgment or decree under this section in any proceeding unless it determines that the petitioner has exhausted administrative remedies available to him within the Internal Revenue Service. A petitioner shall not be deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to a failure by the Secretary to make a determination with respect to initial qualification or continuing qualification of a retirement plan before the expiration of 270 days after the request for such determination was made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Plan put into effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No proceeding may be maintained under this section unless the plan (and, in the case of a controversy involving the continuing qualification of the plan because of an amendment to the plan, the amendment) with respect to which a decision of the Tax Court is sought has been put into effect before the filing of the pleading. A plan or amendment shall not be treated as not being in effect merely because under the plan the funds contributed to the plan may be refunded if the plan (or the plan as so amended) is found to be not qualified.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Time for bringing action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary sends by certified or registered mail notice of his determination with respect to the qualification of the plan to the persons referred to in paragraph (1) (or, in the case of employees referred to in paragraph (1), to any individual designated under regulations prescribed by the Secretary as a representative of such employee), no proceeding may be initiated under this section by any person unless the pleading is filed before the ninety-first day after the day after such notice is mailed to such person (or to his designated representative, in the case of an employee).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Retirement plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;retirement plan&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a pension, profit-sharing, or stock bonus plan described in section 401(a) or a trust which is part of such a plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an annuity plan described in section 403(a).</p>
