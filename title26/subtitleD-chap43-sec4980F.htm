<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Noncompliance period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;noncompliance period&rdquo; means, with respect to any failure, the period beginning on the date the failure first occurs and ending on the date the notice to which the failure relates is provided or the failure is otherwise corrected.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitations on amount of tax</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Tax not to apply where failure not discovered and reasonable diligence exercised</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No tax shall be imposed by subsection (a) on any failure during any period for which it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that any person subject to liability for the tax under subsection (d) did not know that the failure existed and exercised reasonable diligence to meet the requirements of subsection (e).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Tax not to apply to failures corrected within 30 days</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No tax shall be imposed by subsection (a) on any failure if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the person subject to liability for tax under subsection (d) exercised reasonable diligence to meet the requirements of subsection (e), the tax imposed by subsection (a) for failures during the taxable year of the employer (or, in the case of a multiemployer plan, the taxable year of the trust forming part of the plan) shall not exceed $500,000.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, if all persons who are treated as a single employer for purposes of this section do not have the same taxable year, the taxable years taken into account shall be determined under principles similar to the principles of section 1561.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Waiver by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a failure which is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the Secretary may waive part or all of the tax imposed by subsection (a) to the extent that the payment of such tax would be excessive or otherwise inequitable relative to the failure involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Liability for tax</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In the case of a plan other than a multiemployer plan, the employer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In the case of a multiemployer plan, the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Notice requirements for plans significantly reducing benefit accruals</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The notice required by paragraph (1) shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant and shall provide sufficient information (as determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary) to allow applicable individuals to understand the effect of the plan amendment. The Secretary may provide a simplified form of notice for, or exempt from any notice requirement, a plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which has fewer than 100 participants who have accrued a benefit under the plan, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any notice under paragraph (1) may be provided to a person designated, in writing, by the person to which it would otherwise be provided.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Notice before adoption of amendment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) merely because notice is provided before the adoption of the plan amendment if no material modification of the amendment occurs before the amendment is adopted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definitions and special rules</h4>
