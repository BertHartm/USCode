<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Minimum required contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section and section 412(a)(2)(A), except as provided in subsection (f), the term &ldquo;minimum required contribution&rdquo; means, with respect to any plan year of a defined benefit plan which is not a multiemployer plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in any case in which the value of plan assets of the plan (as reduced under subsection (f)(4)(B)) is less than the funding target of the plan for the plan year, the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the target normal cost of the plan for the plan year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the shortfall amortization charge (if any) for the plan for the plan year determined under subsection (c), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the waiver amortization charge (if any) for the plan for the plan year as determined under subsection (e);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in any case in which the value of plan assets of the plan (as reduced under subsection (f)(4)(B)) equals or exceeds the funding target of the plan for the plan year, the target normal cost of the plan for the plan year reduced (but not below zero) by such excess.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Target normal cost</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, except as provided in subsection (i)(2) with respect to plans in at-risk status, the term &ldquo;target normal cost&rdquo; means, for any plan year, the present value of all benefits which are expected to accrue or to be earned under the plan during the plan year. For purposes of this subsection, if any benefit attributable to services performed in a preceding plan year is increased by reason of any increase in compensation during the current plan year, the increase in such benefit shall be treated as having accrued during the current plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Shortfall amortization charge</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the shortfall amortization charge for a plan for any plan year is the aggregate total (not less than zero) of the shortfall amortization installments for such plan year with respect to the shortfall amortization bases for such plan year and each of the 6 preceding plan years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Shortfall amortization installment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The shortfall amortization installments are the amounts necessary to amortize the shortfall amortization base of the plan for any plan year in level annual installments over the 7-plan-year period beginning with such plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Shortfall installment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The shortfall amortization installment for any plan year in the 7-plan-year period under subparagraph (A) with respect to any shortfall amortization base is the annual installment determined under subparagraph (A) for that year for that base.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Segment rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining any shortfall amortization installment under this paragraph, the plan sponsor shall use the segment rates determined under subparagraph (C) of subsection (h)(2), applied under rules similar to the rules of subparagraph (B) of subsection (h)(2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Shortfall amortization base</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the shortfall amortization base of a plan for a plan year is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the funding shortfall of such plan for such plan year, minus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the present value (determined using the segment rates determined under subparagraph (C) of subsection (h)(2), applied under rules similar to the rules of subparagraph (B) of subsection (h)(2)) of the aggregate total of the shortfall amortization installments and waiver amortization installments which have been determined for such plan year and any succeeding plan year with respect to the shortfall amortization bases and waiver amortization bases of the plan for any plan year preceding such plan year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Funding shortfall</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the funding shortfall of a plan for any plan year is the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case in which the value of plan assets of the plan (as reduced under subsection (f)(4)(A)) is equal to or greater than the funding target of the plan for the plan year, the shortfall amortization base of the plan for such plan year shall be zero.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Transition rule</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided in clauses (iii) and (iv), in the case of plan years beginning after 2007 and before 2011, only the applicable percentage of the funding target shall be taken into account under paragraph (3)(A) in determining the funding shortfall for the plan year for purposes of subparagraph (A).</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Certain contributions necessary to avoid benefit limitations disregarded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The excess described in clause (i) with respect to any preceding plan year shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of contributions an employer would be required to make under paragraph (1), (2), or (4) of section 206(g)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#430_2_target" name="430_2">2</a></sup> to avoid a benefit limitation which would otherwise be imposed under such paragraph for the preceding plan year.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Interest rates</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Effective interest rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;effective interest rate&rdquo; means, with respect to any plan for any plan year, the single rate of interest which, if used to determine the present value of the plan's accrued or earned benefits referred to in subsection (d)(1), would result in an amount equal to the funding target of the plan for such plan year.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Election to use yield curve</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Solely for purposes of determining the minimum required contribution under this section, the plan sponsor may, in lieu of the segment rates determined under subparagraph (C), elect to use interest rates under the corporate bond yield curve. For purposes of the preceding sentence such curve shall be determined without regard to the 24-month averaging described in clause (i).
