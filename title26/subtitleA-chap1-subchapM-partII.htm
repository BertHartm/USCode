<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) not more than 25 percent of the value of its total assets is represented by securities (other than those includible under subparagraph (A)),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) not more than 25 percent of the value of its total assets is represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries,<sup><a href="#856_1_target" name="856_1">1</a></sup></p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A real estate investment trust which meets the requirements of this paragraph at the close of any quarter shall not lose its status as a real estate investment trust because of a discrepancy during a subsequent quarter between the value of its various investments and such requirements (including a discrepancy caused solely by the change in the foreign currency exchange rate used to value a foreign asset) unless such discrepancy exists immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property and is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition. A real estate investment trust which does not meet such requirements at the close of any quarter by reason of a discrepancy existing immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property which is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition during such quarter shall not lose its status for such quarter as a real estate investment trust if such discrepancy is eliminated within 30 days after the close of such quarter and in such cases it shall be considered to have met such requirements at the close of such quarter for purposes of applying the preceding sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) For purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The term &ldquo;value&rdquo; means, with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such securities; and with respect to other securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith by the trustees, except that in the case of securities of real estate investment trusts such fair value shall not exceed market value or asset value, whichever is higher.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The term &ldquo;real estate assets&rdquo; means real property (including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property) and shares (or transferable certificates of beneficial interest) in other real estate investment trusts which meet the requirements of this part. Such term also includes any property (not otherwise a real estate asset) attributable to the temporary investment of new capital, but only if such property is stock or a debt instrument, and only for the 1-year period beginning on the date the real estate trust receives such capital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The term &ldquo;interests in real property&rdquo; includes fee ownership and co-ownership of land or improvements thereon, leaseholds of land or improvements thereon, options to acquire land or improvements thereon, and options to acquire leaseholds of land or im<!-- PDFPage:1717 -->provements thereon, but does not include mineral, oil, or gas royalty interests.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is attributable to stock or a debt instrument (within the meaning of section 1275(a)(1)),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) is received or accrued during the 1-year period beginning on the date on which the real estate investment trust receives such capital.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) in a public offering of debt obligations of such trust which have maturities of at least 5 years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) A regular or residual interest in a REMIC shall be treated as a real estate asset, and any amount includible in gross income with respect to such an interest shall be treated as interest on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property; except that, if less than 95 percent of the assets of such REMIC are real estate assets (determined as if the real estate investment trust held such assets), such real estate investment trust shall be treated as holding directly (and as receiving directly) its proportionate share of the assets and income of the REMIC. For purposes of determining whether any interest in a REMIC qualifies under the preceding sentence, any interest held by such REMIC in another REMIC shall be treated as a real estate asset under principles similar to the principles of the preceding sentence, except that, if such REMIC's are part of a tiered structure, they shall be treated as one REMIC for purposes of this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) All other terms shall have the same meaning as when used in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;1 and following).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any income of a real estate investment trust from a transaction entered into by the trust primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain described in paragraph (2) or (3) (or any property which generates such income or gain), including gain from the termination of such a transaction, shall not constitute gross income under paragraphs (2) and (3), but only if such transaction is clearly identified as such before the close of the day on which it was acquired, originated, or entered into (or such other time as the Secretary may prescribe).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) <cap-smallcap>Treatment of timber gains.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) For purposes of this subtitle, income described in this subparagraph shall not be treated as gain from the sale of property described in section 1221(a)(1).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirements applicable to real estate investment trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this part (other than subsection (d) of this section and subsection (g) of section 856) shall not apply to a real estate investment trust for a taxable year unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the deduction for dividends paid during the taxable year (as defined in section 561, but determined without regard to capital gains dividends) equals or exceeds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 90 percent of the real estate investment trust taxable income for the taxable year (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) and by excluding any net capital gain); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 90 percent of the excess of the net income from foreclosure property over the tax imposed on such income by subsection (b)(4)(A); minus</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any excess noncash income (as determined under subsection (e)); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the provisions of this part apply to the real estate investment trust for all taxable years beginning after February 28, 1986, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as of the close of the taxable year, the real estate investment trust has no earnings and profits accumulated in any non-REIT year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;non-REIT year&rdquo; means any taxable year to which the provisions of this part did not apply with respect to the entity. The Secretary may waive the requirements of paragraph (1) for any taxable year if the real estate investment trust establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it was unable to meet such requirements by reason of distributions previously made to meet the requirements of section 4981.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of taxation of real estate investment trusts and holders of shares or certificates of beneficial interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Imposition of tax on real estate investment trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the real estate investment trust taxable income of every real estate investment trust a tax computed as provided in section 11, as though the real estate investment trust taxable income were the taxable income referred to in section 11.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Real estate investment trust taxable income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;real estate investment trust taxable income&rdquo; means the taxable income of the real estate investment trust, adjusted as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The deductions for corporations provided in part VIII (except section 248) of subchapter B (section 241 and following, relating to the deduction for dividends received, etc.) shall not be allowed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) shall be allowed, but shall be computed without regard to that portion of such deduction which is attributable to the amount excluded under subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The taxable income shall be computed without regard to section 443(b) (relating to computation of tax on change of annual accounting period).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) There shall be excluded an amount equal to the net income from foreclosure property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) There shall be deducted an amount equal to the tax imposed by paragraphs (5) and (7) of this subsection, section 856(c)(7)(C), and section 856(g)(5) for the taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) There shall be excluded an amount equal to any net income derived from prohibited transactions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Capital gains</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Alternative tax in case of capital gains</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If for any taxable year a real estate investment trust has a net capital gain, then, in lieu of the tax imposed by subsection (b)(1), there is hereby imposed a tax (if such tax is less than the tax imposed by such subsection) which shall consist of the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a tax, computed as provided in subsection (b)(1), on the real estate investment trust taxable income (determined by excluding such net capital gain and by computing the deduction for dividends paid without regard to capital gain dividends), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a tax determined at the rates provided in section 1201(a) on the excess of the net capital gain over the deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) determined with reference to capital gains dividends only.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of capital gain dividends by shareholders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A capital gain dividend shall be treated by the shareholders or holders of beneficial in<!-- PDFPage:1736 -->terests as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 1 year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Definition of capital gain dividend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this part, a capital gain dividend is any dividend, or part thereof, which is designated by the real estate investment trust as a capital gain dividend in a written notice mailed to its shareholders or holders of beneficial interests at any time before the expiration of 30 days after the close of its taxable year (or mailed to its shareholders or holders of beneficial interests with its annual report for the taxable year); except that, if there is an increase in the excess described in subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph for such year which results from a determination (as defined in section 860(e)), such designation may be made with respect to such increase at any time before the expiration of 120 days after the date of such determination. If the aggregate amount so designated with respect to a taxable year of the trust (including capital gain dividends paid after the close of the taxable year described in section 858) is greater than the net capital gain of the taxable year, the portion of each distribution which shall be a capital gain dividend shall be only that proportion of the amount so designated which such net capital gain bears to the aggregate amount so designated. For purposes of this subparagraph, the amount of the net capital gain for any taxable year which is not a calendar year shall be determined without regard to any net capital loss attributable to transactions after December 31 of such year, and any such net capital loss shall be treated as arising on the 1st day of the next taxable year. To the extent provided in regulations, the preceding sentence shall apply also for purposes of computing the taxable income of the real estate investment trust.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Treatment by shareholders of undistributed capital gains</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Every shareholder of a real estate investment trust at the close of the trust's taxable year shall include, in computing his long-term capital gains in his return for his taxable year in which the last day of the trust's taxable year falls, such amount as the trust shall designate in respect of such shares in a written notice mailed to its shareholders at any time prior to the expiration of 60 days after the close of its taxable year (or mailed to its shareholders or holders of beneficial interests with its annual report for the taxable year), but the amount so includible by any shareholder shall not exceed that part of the amount subjected to tax in subparagraph (A)(ii) which he would have received if all of such amount had been distributed as capital gain dividends by the trust to the holders of such shares at the close of its taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For purposes of this title, every such shareholder shall be deemed to have paid, for his taxable year under clause (i), the tax imposed by subparagraph (A)(ii) on the amounts required by this subparagraph to be included in respect of such shares in computing his long-term capital gains for that year; and such shareholders shall be allowed credit or refund as the case may be, for the tax so deemed to have been paid by him.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The adjusted basis of such shares in the hands of the holder shall be increased with respect to the amounts required by this subparagraph to be included in computing his long-term capital gains, by the difference between the amount of such includible gains and the tax deemed paid by such shareholder in respect of such shares under clause (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) In the event of such designation, the tax imposed by subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be paid by the real estate investment trust within 30 days after the close of its taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) The earnings and profits of such real estate investment trust, and the earnings and profits of any such shareholder which is a corporation, shall be appropriately adjusted in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) As used in this subparagraph, the terms &ldquo;shares&rdquo; and &ldquo;shareholders&rdquo; shall include beneficial interests and holders of beneficial interests, respectively.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Coordination with net operating loss provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of section 172, if a real estate investment trust pays capital gain dividends during any taxable year, the amount of the net capital gain for such taxable year (to the extent such gain does not exceed the amount of such capital gain dividends) shall be excluded in determining&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the net operating loss for the taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of the net operating loss of any prior taxable year which may be carried through such taxable year under section 172(b)(2) to a succeeding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Certain distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a shareholder of a real estate investment trust to whom section 897 does not apply by reason of the second sentence of section 897(h)(1), the amount which would be included in computing long-term capital gains for such shareholder under subparagraph (B) or (D) (without regard to this subparagraph)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall not be included in computing such shareholder's long-term capital gains, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall be included in such shareholder's gross income as a dividend from the real estate investment trust.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Income from foreclosure property</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Imposition of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A tax is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the net income from foreclosure property of every real estate investment trust. Such tax shall be computed by multiplying the net income from foreclosure property by the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b).</p>
