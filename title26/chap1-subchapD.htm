<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirements for qualification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A trust created or organized in the United States and forming part of a stock bonus, pension, or profit-sharing plan of an employer for the exclusive benefit of his employees or their beneficiaries shall constitute a qualified trust under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if contributions are made to the trust by such employer, or employees, or both, or by another employer who is entitled to deduct his contributions under section 404(a)(3)(B) (relating to deduction for contributions to profit-sharing and stock bonus plans), for the purpose of distributing to such employees or their beneficiaries the corpus and income of the fund accumulated by the trust in accordance with such plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if under the trust instrument it is impossible, at any time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to employees and their beneficiaries under the trust, for any part of the corpus or income to be (within the taxable year or thereafter) used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of his employees or their beneficiaries (but this paragraph shall not be construed, in the case of a multiemployer plan, to prohibit the return of a contribution within 6 months after the plan administrator determines that the contribution was made by a mistake of fact or law (other than a mistake relating to whether the plan is described in section 401(a) or the trust which is part of such plan is exempt from taxation under section 501(a), or the return of any withdrawal liability payment determined to be an overpayment within 6 months of such determination).;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#401_1_target" name="401_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if the plan of which such trust is a part satisfies the requirements of section 410 (relating to minimum participation standards); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) if the contributions or benefits provided under the plan do not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)). For purposes of this paragraph, there shall be excluded from consideration employees described in section 410(b)(3)(A) and (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Special rules relating to nondiscrimination requirements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Salaried or clerical employees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A classification shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of paragraph (4) or section 410(b)(2)(A)(i) merely because it is limited to salaried or clerical employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Contributions and benefits may bear uniform relationship to compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A plan shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of paragraph (4) merely because the contributions or benefits of, or on behalf of, the employees under the plan bear a uniform relationship to the compensation (within the meaning of section 414(s)) of such employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Certain disparity permitted</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A plan shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of paragraph (4) merely because the contributions or benefits of, or on behalf of, the employees under the plan favor highly compensated employees (as defined in section 414(q)) in the manner permitted under subsection (l).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Integrated defined benefit plan.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A defined benefit plan shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of paragraph (4) merely because the plan provides that the employer-derived accrued retirement benefit for any participant under the plan may not exceed the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the participant's final pay with the employer, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the employer-derived retirement benefit created under Federal law attributable to service by the participant with the employer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;For purposes of this clause, the employer-derived retirement benefit created under Federal law shall be treated as accruing ratably over 35 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Final pay</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this subparagraph, the participant's final pay is the compensation (as defined in section 414(q)(7)) paid to the participant by the employer for any year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) which ends during the 5-year period ending with the year in which the participant separated from service for the employer, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) for which the participant's total compensation from the employer was highest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) 2 <cap-smallcap>or more plans treated as single plan</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of determining whether 2 or more plans of an employer satisfy the requirements of paragraph (4) when considered as a single plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>Contributions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the amount of contributions on behalf of the employees allowed as a deduction under section 404 for the taxable year with respect to such plans, taken together, bears a uniform relationship to the compensation (within the meaning of section 414(s)) of such employees, the plans shall not be considered discriminatory merely because the rights of employees to, or derived from, the employer contributions under the separate plans do not become nonforfeitable at the same rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Benefits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the employees&rsquo; rights to benefits under the separate plans do not become nonforfeitable at the same rate, but the levels of benefits provided by the separate plans satisfy the requirements of regulations prescribed by the Secretary to take account of the differences in such rates, the plans shall not be considered discriminatory merely because of the difference in such rates.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A plan shall be considered as meeting the requirements of paragraph (3) during the whole of any taxable year of the plan if on one day in each quarter it satisfied such requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan of <!-- PDFPage:719 -->which such trust is a part satisfies the requirements of section 411 (relating to minimum vesting standards).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) A trust forming part of a defined benefit plan shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan provides that forfeitures must not be applied to increase the benefits any employee would otherwise receive under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) <cap-smallcap>Required distributions.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this subsection unless the plan provides that the entire interest of each employee&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) will be distributed to such employee not later than the required beginning date, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) will be distributed, beginning not later than the required beginning date, in accordance with regulations, over the life of such employee or over the lives of such employee and a designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such employee or the life expectancy of such employee and a designated beneficiary).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Required distribution where employee dies before entire interest is distributed.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>Where distributions have begun under subparagraph</cap-smallcap> (A)(ii).&mdash;A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan provides that if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the distribution of the employee's interest has begun in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the employee dies before his entire interest has been distributed to him,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;the remaining portion of such interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distributions being used under subparagraph (A)(ii) as of the date of his death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 5-<cap-smallcap>year rule for other cases</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan provides that, if an employee dies before the distribution of the employee's interest has begun in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii), the entire interest of the employee will be distributed within 5 years after the death of such employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Exception to 5-year rule for certain amounts payable over life of beneficiary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) any portion of the employee's interest is payable to (or for the benefit of) a designated beneficiary,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) such portion will be distributed (in accordance with regulations) over the life of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such beneficiary), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) such distributions begin not later than 1 year after the date of the employee's death or such later date as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;for purposes of clause (ii), the portion referred to in subclause (I) shall be treated as distributed on the date on which such distributions begin.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) <cap-smallcap>Special rule for surviving spouse of employee</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the designated beneficiary referred to in clause (iii)(I) is the surviving spouse of the employee&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the date on which the distributions are required to begin under clause (iii)(III) shall not be earlier than the date on which the employee would have attained age 701/2, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) if the surviving spouse dies before the distributions to such spouse begin, this subparagraph shall be applied as if the surviving spouse were the employee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Required beginning date</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;required beginning date&rdquo; means April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee attains age 701/2. In the case of a governmental plan or church plan, the required beginning date shall be the later of the date determined under the preceding sentence or April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee retires. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;church plan&rdquo; means a plan maintained by a church for church employees, and the term &ldquo;church&rdquo; means any church (as defined in section 3121(w)(3)(A)) or qualified church-controlled organization (as defined in section 3121(w)(3)(B)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Life expectancy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this paragraph, the life expectancy of an employee and the employee's spouse (other than in the case of a life annuity) may be redetermined but not more frequently than annually.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) <cap-smallcap>Treatment of payments to children</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, for purposes of this paragraph, any amount paid to a child shall be treated as if it had been paid to the surviving spouse if such amount will become payable to the surviving spouse upon such child reaching majority (or other designated event permitted under regulations).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) <cap-smallcap>Treatment of incidental death benefit distributions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this title, any distribution required under the incidental death benefit requirements of this subsection shall be treated as a distribution required under this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Plans benefiting owner-employees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of any plan which provides contributions or benefits for employees some or all of whom are owner-employees (as defined in subsection (c)(3)), a trust forming part of such plan shall constitute a qualified trust under this section only if the requirements of subsection (d) are also met.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of any top-heavy plan, a trust forming part of such <!-- PDFPage:720 -->plan shall constitute a qualified trust under this section only if the requirements of section 416 are met.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) which will take effect if such plan becomes a top-heavy plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) which meet the requirements of section 416.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Exemption for governmental plans</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subparagraph shall not apply to any governmental plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of any plan to which this paragraph applies, except as provided in section 417, a trust forming part of such plan shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Taxability of beneficiary of exempt trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, any amount actually distributed to any distributee by any employees&rsquo; trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a) shall be taxable to the distributee, in the taxable year of the distributee in which distributed, under section 72 (relating to annuities).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Taxability of beneficiary of nonexempt trust</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Contributions to an employees&rsquo; trust made by an employer during a taxable year of the employer which ends with or within a taxable year of the trust for which the trust is not exempt from tax under section 501(a) shall be included in the gross income of the employee in accordance with section 83 (relating to property transferred in connection with performance of services), except that the value of the employee's interest in the trust shall be substituted for the fair market value of the property for purposes of applying such section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount actually distributed or made available to any distributee by any trust described in paragraph (1) shall be taxable to the distributee, in the taxable year in which so distributed or made available, under section 72 (relating to annuities), except that distributions of income of such trust before the annuity starting date (as defined in section 72(c)(4)) shall be included in the gross income of the employee without regard to section 72(e)(5) (relating to amounts not received as annuities).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Highly compensated employees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If 1 of the reasons a trust is not exempt from tax under section 501(a) is the failure of the plan of which it is a part to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(26) or 410(b), then a highly compensated employee shall, in lieu of the amount determined under paragraph (1) or (2) include in gross income for the taxable year with or within which the taxable year of the trust ends an amount equal to the vested accrued benefit of such employee (other than the employee's investment in the contract) as of the close of such taxable year of the trust.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Failure to meet coverage tests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a trust is not exempt from tax under section 501(a) for any taxable year solely because such trust is part of a plan which fails to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(26) or 410(b), paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply by reason of such failure to any employee who was not a highly compensated employee during&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If contributions are paid by an employer to or under a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plan, or if compensation is paid or accrued on account of any employee under a plan deferring the receipt of such compensation, such contributions or compensation shall not be deductible under this chapter; but, if they would otherwise be deductible, they shall be deductible <!-- PDFPage:774 -->under this section, subject, however, to the following limitations as to the amounts deductible in any year:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Pension trusts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the taxable year when paid, if the contributions are paid into a pension trust, and if such taxable year ends within or with a taxable year of the trust for which the trust is exempt under section 501(a), in an amount determined as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount necessary to satisfy the minimum funding standard provided by section 412(a) for plan years ending within or with such taxable year (or for any prior plan year), if such amount is greater than the amount determined under clause (ii) or (iii) (whichever is applicable with respect to the plan),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount necessary to provide with respect to all of the employees under the trust the remaining unfunded cost of their past and current service credits distributed as a level amount, or a level percentage of compensation, over the remaining future service of each such employee, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, but if such remaining unfunded cost with respect to any 3 individuals is more than 50 percent of such remaining unfunded cost, the amount of such unfunded cost attributable to such individuals shall be distributed over a period of at least 5 taxable years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) an amount equal to the normal cost of the plan, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, plus, if past service or other supplementary pension or annuity credits are provided by the plan, an amount necessary to amortize the unfunded costs attributable to such credits in equal annual payments (until fully amortized) over 10 years, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In determining the amount deductible in such year under the foregoing limitations the funding method and the actuarial assumptions used shall be those used for such year under section 412, and the maximum amount deductible for such year shall be an amount equal to the full funding limitation for such year determined under section 412.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule in case of certain amendments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a plan which the Secretary of Labor finds to be collectively bargained which makes an election under this subparagraph (in such manner and at such time as may be provided under regulations prescribed by the Secretary), if the full funding limitation determined under section 412(c)(7) for such year is zero, if as a result of any plan amendment applying to such plan year, the amount determined under section 412(c)(7)(B) exceeds the amount determined under section 412(c)(7)(A), and if the funding method and the actuarial assumptions used are those used for such year under section 412, the maximum amount deductible in such year under the limitations of this paragraph shall be an amount equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the full funding limitation for such year determined by applying section 412(c)(7) but increasing the amount referred to in subparagraph (A) thereof by the decrease in the present value of all unamortized liabilities resulting from such amendment, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the normal cost under the plan reduced by the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments over 10 years (until fully amortized) the decrease described in clause (i).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In the case of any election under this subparagraph, the amount deductible under the limitations of this paragraph with respect to any of the plan years following the plan year for which such election was made shall be determined as provided under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary to carry out the purposes of this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Certain collectively-bargained plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a plan which the Secretary of Labor finds to be collectively bargained, established or maintained by an employer doing business in not less than 40 States and engaged in the trade or business of furnishing or selling services described in section 168(i)(10)(C), with respect to which the rates have been established or approved by a State or political subdivision thereof, by any agency or instrumentality of the United States, or by a public service or public utility commission or other similar body of any State or political subdivision thereof, and in the case of any employer which is a member of a controlled group with such employer, subparagraph (B) shall be applied by substituting for the words &ldquo;plan amendment&rdquo; the words &ldquo;plan amendment or increase in benefits payable under title II of the Social Security Act&rdquo;. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;controlled group&rdquo; has the meaning provided by section 1563(a), determined without regard to section 1563(a)(4) and (e)(3)(C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Special rule in case of certain plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any defined benefit plan (other than a multiemployer plan) which has more than 100 participants for the plan year, except as provided in regulations, the maximum amount deductible under the limitations of this paragraph shall not be less than the unfunded current liability determined under section 412(<em>l</em>). For purposes of determining whether a plan has more than 100 participants, all defined benefit plans maintained by the same employer (or any member of such employer's controlled group (within the meaning of section 412(<em>l</em>)(8)(c))) shall be treated as 1 plan, but only employees of such member or employer shall be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Carryover</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount paid in a taxable year in excess of the amount deductible in such year <!-- PDFPage:775 -->under the foregoing limitations shall be deductible in the succeeding taxable years in order of time to the extent of the difference between the amount paid and deductible in each such succeeding year and the maximum amount deductible for such year under the foregoing limitations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Employees&rsquo; annuities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the taxable year when paid, in an amount determined in accordance with paragraph (1), if the contributions are paid toward the purchase of retirement annuities, or retirement annuities and medical benefits as described in section 401(h), and such purchase is part of a plan which meets the requirements of section 401(a)(3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), (16), (17), (18),<sup><a href="#404_1_target" name="404_1">1</a></sup> (19), (20), (22), (26), (27), and (31) and, if applicable, the requirements of section 401(a)(10) and of section 401(d), and if refunds of premiums, if any, are applied within the current taxable year or next succeeding taxable year toward the purchase of such retirement annuities, or such retirement annuities and medical benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Stock bonus and profit-sharing trusts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Limits on deductible contributions</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the taxable year when paid, if the contributions are paid into a stock bonus or profit-sharing trust, and if such taxable year ends within or with a taxable year of the trust with respect to which the trust is exempt under section 501(a), in an amount not in excess of 15 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during the taxable year to the beneficiaries under the stock bonus or profit-sharing plan.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Carryover of excess contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any amount paid into the trust in any taxable year in excess of the limitation of clause (i) (or the corresponding provision of prior law) shall be deductible in the succeeding taxable years in order of time, but the amount so deductible under this clause in any 1 such succeeding taxable year together with the amount allowable under clause (i) shall not exceed 15 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during such taxable year to the beneficiaries under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Certain retirement plans excluded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;stock bonus or profit-sharing trust&rdquo; shall not include any trust designed to provide benefits upon retirement and covering a period of years, if under the plan the amounts to be contributed by the employer can be determined actuarially as provided in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) 2 or more trusts treated as 1 trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the contributions are made to 2 or more stock bonus or profit-sharing trusts, such trusts shall be considered a single trust for purposes of applying the limitations in this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(v) Pre-87 limitation carryforwards</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The limitation of clause (i) for any taxable year shall be increased by the unused pre-87 limitation carryforwards (but not to an amount in excess of 25 percent of the compensation described in clause (i)).</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Unused pre-87 limitation carryforwards</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) contributions under a funded plan of deferred compensation (whether or not a plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a)) are not provided by any other person with respect to the remuneration paid to such individual by the domestic subsidiary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Domestic subsidiary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A corporation shall be treated as a domestic subsidiary for any taxable year only if&mdash;</p>

<!-- PDFPage:793 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of compensation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of applying section 402(d) with respect to an individual who is treated as an employee of a domestic parent corporation under subsection (a), such individual shall not be considered as separated from the service of such domestic parent corporation solely by reason of the fact that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the corporation of which such individual is an employee ceases, for any taxable year, to be a domestic subsidiary within the meaning of subsection (a)(2)(A),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such individual ceases to be an employee of a domestic subsidiary of such domestic parent corporation, if he becomes an employee of another corporation controlled by such domestic parent corporation, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) except as provided in paragraph (2), no deduction shall be allowed to such domestic parent corporation or to any other corporation which is entitled to deduct its contributions under such sections,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there shall be allowed as a deduction to the domestic subsidiary of which such individual is an employee an amount equal to the amount which (but for paragraph (1)) would be deductible under section 404 by the domestic parent corporation if he were an employee of the domestic parent corporation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any reference to compensation shall be considered to be a reference to the total compensation of such individual (determined with the application of subsection (b)(2)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any amount deductible by a domestic subsidiary under this subsection shall be deductible for its taxable year with or within which the taxable year of such domestic parent corporation ends.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Treatment as employee under related provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An individual who is treated as an employee of a domestic parent corporation under subsection (a) shall also be treated as an employee of such domestic parent corporation, with respect to the plan described in subsection (a)(1)(A), for purposes of applying the following provisions of this title:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Section 72(f) (relating to special rules for computing employees&rsquo; contributions).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;individual retirement account&rdquo; means a trust created or organized in the United States for the exclusive benefit of an individual or his beneficiaries, but only if the written governing instrument creating the trust meets the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Except in the case of a rollover contribution described in subsection (d)(3) in section 402(c), 403(a)(4), or 403(b)(8), no contribution will be accepted unless it is in cash, and contributions will not be accepted for the taxable year in excess of $2,000 on behalf of any individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The trustee is a bank (as defined in subsection (n)) or such other person who demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the manner in which such other person will administer the trust will be consistent with the requirements of this section.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such term does not include such an annuity contract for any taxable year of the owner in which it is disqualified on the application of subsection (e) or for any subsequent taxable year. For purposes of this subsection, no contract shall be treated as an endowment contract if it matures later than the taxable year in which the individual in whose name such contract is purchased attains age 701/2; if it is not for the exclusive benefit of the individual in whose name it is purchased or his beneficiaries; or if the aggregate annual premiums under all such contracts purchased in the name of such individual for any taxable year exceed $2,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Accounts established by employers and certain associations of employees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A trust created or organized in the United States by an employer for the exclusive benefit of his employees or their beneficiaries, or by an association of employees (which may include employees within the meaning of section 401(c)(1)) for the exclusive benefit of its members or their beneficiaries, shall be treated as an individual retirement account (described in subsection (a)), but only if the written governing instrument creating the trust meets the following requirements:</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Paragraph (1) does not apply to any amount paid or distributed out of an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity to the individual for whose benefit the account or annuity is maintained if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the entire amount received (including money and any other property) is paid into an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity (other than an endowment contract) for the benefit of such individual not later than the 60th day after the day on which he receives the payment or distribution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) no amount in the account and no part of the value of the annuity is attributable to any source other than a rollover contribution (as defined in section 402) from an employee's trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a) or from an annuity plan described in section 403(a) (and any earnings on such contribution), and the entire amount received (including property and other money) is paid (for the benefit of such individual) into another such trust or annuity plan not later than the 60th day on which the individual receives the payment or the distribution; or</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Denial of rollover treatment for inherited accounts, etc.</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) such individual was not the surviving spouse of such other individual.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Partial rollovers permitted</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If any amount paid or distributed out of an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity would meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) but for the fact that the entire amount was not paid into an eligible plan as required by clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of subparagraph (A), such amount shall be treated as meeting the requirements of subparagraph (A) to the extent it is paid into an eligible plan referred to in such clause not later than the 60th day referred to in such clause.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Eligible plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), the term &ldquo;eligible plan&rdquo; means any account, annuity, contract, or plan referred to in subparagraph (A).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Contributions returned before due date of return</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) does not apply to the distribution of any contribution paid during a taxable year to an individual retirement account or for an individual retirement annuity if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) no deduction is allowed under section 219 with respect to such contribution, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such distribution is accompanied by the amount of net income attributable to such contribution.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In the case of such a distribution, for purposes of section 61, any net income described in subparagraph (C) shall be deemed to have been earned and receivable in the taxable year in which such contribution is made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Certain distributions of excess contributions after due date for taxable year</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any individual, if the aggregate contributions (other than rollover contributions) paid for any taxable year to an individual retirement account or for an individual retirement annuity do not exceed $2,250, paragraph (1) shall not apply to the distribution of any such contribution to the extent that such contribution exceeds the amount allowable as a deduction under section 219 for the taxable year for which the contribution was paid&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if such distribution is received after the date described in paragraph (4),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) but only to the extent that no deduction has been allowed under section 219 with respect to such excess contribution.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">If employer contributions on behalf of the individual are paid for the taxable year to a simplified employee pension, the dollar limitation of the preceding sentence shall be increased by the lesser of the amount of such contributions or the dollar limitation in effect under section 415(c)(1)(A) for such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Excess rollover contributions attributable to erroneous information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the taxpayer reasonably relies on information supplied pursuant to subtitle F for determining the amount of a rollover contribution, but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the information was erroneous,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">subparagraph (A) shall be applied by increasing the dollar limit set forth therein by that portion of the excess contribution which was attributable to such information.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this paragraph, the amount allowable as a deduction under section 219 shall be computed without regard to section 219(g).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:797 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Transfer of account incident to divorce</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The transfer of an individual's interest in an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity to his spouse or former spouse under a divorce or separation instrument described in subparagraph (A) of section 71(b)(2) is not to be considered a taxable transfer made by such individual notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, and such interest at the time of the transfer is to be treated as an individual retirement account of such spouse, and not of such individual. Thereafter such account or annuity for purposes of this subtitle is to be treated as maintained for the benefit of such spouse.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Special rules for simplified employee pensions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Transfer or rollover of contributions prohibited until deferral test met</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection or section 72(t), paragraph (1) and section 72(t)(1) shall apply to the transfer or distribution from a simplified employee pension of any contribution under a salary reduction arrangement described in subsection (k)(6) (or any income allocable thereto) before a determination as to whether the requirements of subsection (k)(6)(A)(iii) are met with respect to such contribution.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certain exclusions treated as deductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraphs (4) and (5) and section 4973, any amount excludable or excluded from gross income under section 402(h) shall be treated as an amount allowable or allowed as a deduction under section 219.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Tax treatment of accounts and annuities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Exemption from tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any individual retirement account is exempt from taxation under this subtitle unless such account has ceased to be an individual retirement account by reason of paragraph (2) or (3).

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A defined contribution plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, allocations to the employee's account are not ceased, and the rate at which amounts are allocated to the employee's account is not reduced, because of the attainment of any age.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Application to target benefit plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall provide by regulation for the application of the requirements of this paragraph to target benefit plans.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Separate accounting required in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of the defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for the portion of each employee's accrued benefit derived from any voluntary employee contributions permitted under the plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of any plan which is not a defined benefit plan, the plan requires sepa<!-- PDFPage:827 -->rate accounting for each employee's accrued benefit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Year of participation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of determining an employee's accrued benefit, the term &ldquo;year of participation&rdquo; means a period of service (beginning at the earliest date on which the employee is a participant in the plan and which is included in a period of service required to be taken into account under section 410(a)(5), determined without regard to section 410(a)(5)(E)) as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor which provide for the calculation of such period on any reasonable and consistent basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Less than full time service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, except as provided in subparagraph (C), in the case of any employee whose customary employment is less than full time, the calculation of such employee's service on any basis which provides less than a ratable portion of the accrued benefit to which he would be entitled under the plan if his customary employment were full time shall not be treated as made on a reasonable and consistent basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Less than 1,000 hours of service during year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of any employee whose service is less than 1,000 hours during any calendar year, plan year or other 12-consecutive month period designated by the plan (and not prohibited under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor) the calculation of his period of service shall not be treated as not made on a reasonable and consistent basis solely because such service is not taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Seasonal industries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any seasonal industry where the customary period of employment is less than 1,000 hours during a calendar year, the term &ldquo;year of participation&rdquo; shall be such period as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Maritime industries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, in the case of any maritime industry, 125 days of service shall be treated as a year of participation. The Secretary of Labor may prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this subparagraph.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Accrued benefit derived from employer contributions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if a separate account is not maintained with respect to an employee's contributions under such a plan, the amount which bears the same ratio to his total accrued benefit as the total amount of the employee's contributions (less withdrawals) bears to the sum of such contributions and the contributions made on his behalf by the employer (less withdrawals).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Defined benefit plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a defined benefit plan, the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee as of any applicable date is the amount equal to the employee's accumulated contributions expressed as an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, using an interest rate which would be used under the plan under section 417(e)(3) (as of the determination date).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Definition of accumulated contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;accumulated contribution&rdquo; means the total of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) interest on the sum of the amounts determined under clauses (i) and (ii) compounded annually&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) at the rate of 120 percent of the Federal mid-term rate (as in effect under section 1274 for the 1st month of a plan year) for the period beginning with the 1st plan year to which subsection (a)(2) applies (by reason of the applicable effective date) and ending with the date on which the determination is being made, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) at the interest rate which would be used under the plan under section 417(e)(3) (as of the determination date) for the period beginning with the determination date and ending on the date on which the employee attains normal retirement age.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;mandatory contributions&rdquo; means amounts contributed to the plan by the employee which are required as a condition of employment, as a condition of participation in such plan, or as a condition of obtaining benefits under the plan attributable to employer contributions.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:828 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary is authorized to adjust by regulation the conversion factor described in subparagraph (B) from time to time as he may deem necessary. No such adjustment shall be effective for a plan year beginning before the expiration of 1 year after such adjustment is determined and published.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Actuarial adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, in the case of any defined benefit plan, if an employee's accrued benefit is to be determined as an amount other than an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, or if the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee is to be determined with respect to a benefit other than an annual benefit in the form of a single life annuity (without ancillary benefits) commencing at normal retirement age, the employee's accrued benefit, or the accrued benefits derived from contributions made by an employee, as the case may be, shall be the actuarial equivalent of such benefit or amount determined under paragraph (1) or (2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Coordination with section 401(a)(4)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A plan which satisfies the requirements of this section shall be treated as satisfying any vesting requirements resulting from the application of section 401(a)(4) unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) there has been a pattern of abuse under the plan (such as a dismissal of employees before their accrued benefits become nonforfeitable) tending to discriminate in favor of employees who are highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there have been, or there is reason to believe there will be, an accrual of benefits or forfeitures tending to discriminate in favor of employees who are highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prohibited discrimination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (a) shall not apply to benefits which may not be provided for designated employees in the event of early termination of the plan under provisions of the plan adopted pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary to preclude the discrimination prohibited by section 401(a)(4).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Termination or partial termination; discontinuance of contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), a trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under section 401(a) unless the plan of which such trust is a part provides that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) upon its termination or partial termination, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a plan to which section 412 does not apply, upon complete discontinuance of contributions under the plan,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the rights of all affected employees to benefits accrued to the date of such termination, partial termination, or discontinuance, to the extent funded as of such date, or the amounts credited to the employees&rsquo; accounts, are nonforfeitable. This paragraph shall not apply to benefits or contributions which, under provisions of the plan adopted pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary to preclude the discrimination prohibited by section 401(a)(4), may not be used for designated employees in the event of early termination of the plan. For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of the complete discontinuance of contributions under a profit-sharing or stock bonus plan, such plan shall be treated as having terminated on the day on which the plan administrator notifies the Secretary (in accordance with regulations) of the discontinuance.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Treatment of voluntary employee contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a defined benefit plan which permits voluntary employee contributions, the portion of an employee's accrued benefit derived from such contributions shall be treated as an accrued benefit derived from employee contributions under a plan other than a defined benefit plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Accrued benefit not to be decreased by amendment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this section if the accrued benefit of a participant is decreased by an amendment of the plan, other than an amendment described in section 412(c)(8), or section 4281 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of certain plan amendments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit or a retirement-type subsidy (as defined in regulations), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) eliminating an optional form of benefit,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment shall be treated as reducing accrued benefits. In the case of a retirement-type subsidy, the preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to a participant who satisfies (either before or after the amendment) the preamendment conditions for the subsidy. The Secretary may by regulations provide that this subparagraph shall not apply to a plan amendment described in clause (ii) (other than a plan amendment having an effect described in clause (i)).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Special rule for ESOPS</h4>

<h4 class="note-head">Alternate Methods of Satisfying Requirements for Vesting and Accrued Benefits</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 1012(c) of Pub. L. 93&ndash;406, as amended by Pub. L. 99&ndash;514, &sect;2, Oct. 22, 1986, 100 Stat. 2095, provided that: &ldquo;In the case of any plan maintained on January 1, 1974, if, not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act [Sept. 2, 1974], the plan administrator petitions the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Labor may prescribe an alternate method which shall be treated as satisfying the requirements of subsection (a)(2) of section 411 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [formerly I.R.C. 1954], or of subsection (b)(1) (other than subparagraph (D) thereof) of such section 411, or of both such provisions for a period of not more than 4 years.

<p class="note-body-block">In the case of any plan with respect to which an alternate method has been prescribed under the preceding provisions of this subsection for a period of not more than 4 years, if, not later than 1 year before the expiration of such period, the plan administrator petitions the Secretary of Labor for an extension of such alternate method, and the Secretary makes the findings required by the preceding sentence, such alternate method may be extended for not more than 3 years.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (h), this section applies to a plan if, for any plan year beginning on or after the effective date of this section for such plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such plan included a trust which qualified (or was determined by the Secretary to have qualified) under section 401(a), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such plan satisfied (or was determined by the Secretary to have satisfied) the requirements of section 403(a).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A plan to which this section applies shall have satisfied the minimum funding standard for such plan for a plan year if as of the end of such plan year, the plan does not have an accumulated funding deficiency. For purposes of this section and section 4971, the term &ldquo;accumulated funding deficiency&rdquo; means for any plan the excess of the total charges to the funding standard account for all plan years (beginning with the first plan year to which this section applies) over the total credits to such account for such years or, if less, the excess of the total charges to the alternative minimum funding standard account for such plan years over the total credits to such account for such years. In any plan year in which a multiemployer plan is in reorganization, the accumulated funding deficiency of the plan shall be determined under section 418B.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Funding standard account</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Account required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each plan to which this section applies shall establish and maintain a funding standard account. Such account shall be credited and charged solely as provided in this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Charges to account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be charged with the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the normal cost of the plan for the plan year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amounts necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of a plan in existence on January 1, 1974, the unfunded past service liability under the plan on the first day of the first plan year to which this section applies, over a period of 40 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a plan which comes into existence after January 1, 1974, the unfunded past service liability under the plan on the first day of the first plan year to which this section applies, over a period of 30 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net increase (if any) in unfunded past service liability under the plan arising from plan amendments adopted in such year, over a period of 30 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net experience loss (if any) under the plan, over a period of 5 plan years (15 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net loss (if any) resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used under the plan, over a period of 10 plan years (30 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the amount necessary to amortize each waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of subsection (d)(3)) for each prior plan year in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 5 plan years (15 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 5 plan years any amount credited to the funding standard account under paragraph (3)(D).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For additional requirements in the case of plans other than multiemployer plans, see subsection (<em>l</em>).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Credits to account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be credited with the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount considered contributed by the employer to or under the plan for the plan year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized)&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:834 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net decrease (if any) in unfunded past service liability under the plan arising from plan amendments adopted in such year, over a period of 30 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net experience gain (if any) under the plan, over a period of 5 plan years (15 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net gain (if any) resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used under the plan, over a period of 10 plan years (30 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the amount of the waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of subsection (d)(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#412_1_target" name="412_1">1</a></sup> for the plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in the case of a plan year for which the accumulated funding deficiency is determined under the funding standard account if such plan year follows a plan year for which such deficiency was determined under the alternative minimum funding standards, the excess (if any) of any debit balance in the funding standard account (determined without regard to this subparagraph) over any debit balance in the alternative minimum funding standard account.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Combining and offsetting amounts to be amortized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, amounts required to be amortized under paragraph (2) or paragraph (3), as the case may be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may be combined into one amount under such paragraph to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization period for all items entering into such combined amount, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may be offset against amounts required to be amortized under the other such paragraph, with the resulting amount to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization periods for all items entering into whichever of the two amounts being offset is the greater.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Interest</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The funding standard account (and items therein) shall be charged or credited (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) with interest at the appropriate rate consistent with the rate or rates of interest used under the plan to determine costs.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Required change of interest rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of determining a plan's current liability and for purposes of determining a plan's required contribution under section 412(<em>l</em>) for any plan year&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If any rate of interest used under the plan to determine cost is not within the permissible range, the plan shall establish a new rate of interest within the permissible range.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Permissible range</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">Except as provided in subclause (II), the term &ldquo;permissible range&rdquo; means a rate of interest which is not more than 10 percent above, and not more than 10 percent below, the weighted average of the rates of interest on 30-year Treasury securities during the 4-year period ending on the last day before the beginning of the plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Secretarial authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">If the Secretary finds that the lowest rate of interest permissible under subclause (I) is unreasonably high, the Secretary may prescribe a lower rate of interest, except that such rate may not be less than 80 percent of the average rate determined under subclause (I).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Assumptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Notwithstanding subsection (c)(3)(A)(i), the interest rate used under the plan shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) determined without taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations, but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) consistent with the assumptions which reflect the purchase rates which would be used by insurance companies to satisfy the liabilities under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Certain amortization charges and credits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a plan which, immediately before the date of the enactment of the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, was a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of section 414(f) as in effect immediately before such date)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any amount described in paragraph (2)(B)(ii), (2)(B)(iii), or (3)(B)(i) of this subsection which arose in a plan year beginning before such date shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 40 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the amount arose;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any amount described in paragraph (2)(B)(iv) or (3)(B)(ii) of this subsection which arose in a plan year beginning before such date shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 20 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the amount arose;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any change in past service liability which arises during the period of 3 plan years beginning on or after such date, and results from a plan amendment adopted before such date, shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 40 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the change arises; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any change in past service liability which arises during the period of 2 plan years beginning on or after such date, and results from the changing of a group of participants from one benefit level to another <!-- PDFPage:835 -->benefit level under a schedule of plan benefits which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) was adopted before such date, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) was effective for any plan participant before the beginning of the first plan year beginning on or after such date,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 40 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the change arises.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Special rules for multiemployer plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Withdrawal liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount received by a multiemployer plan in payment of all or part of an employer's withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 shall be considered an amount contributed by the employer to or under the plan. The Secretary may prescribe by regulation additional charges and credits to a multiemployer plan's funding standard account to the extent necessary to prevent withdrawal liability payments from being unduly reflected as advance funding for plan liabilities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjustments when a multiemployer plan leaves reorganization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a multiemployer plan is not in reorganization in the plan year but was in reorganization in the immediately preceding plan year, any balance in the funding standard account at the close of such immediately preceding plan year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall be eliminated by an offsetting credit or charge (as the case may be), but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall be taken into account in subsequent plan years by being amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 30 plan years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent of any accumulated funding deficiency under section 418B(a) as of the end of the last plan year that the plan was in reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Plan payments to supplemental program or withdrawal liability payment fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount paid by a plan during a plan year to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation pursuant to section 4222 of such Act or to a fund exempt under section 501(c)(22) pursuant to section 4223 of such Act shall reduce the amount of contributions considered received by the plan for the plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Interim withdrawal liability payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount paid by an employer pending a final determination of the employer's withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of title IV of such Act and subsequently refunded to the employer by the plan shall be charged to the funding standard account in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) For purposes of the full funding limitation under subsection (c)(7), unless otherwise provided by the plan, the accrued liability under a multiemployer plan shall not include benefits which are not nonforfeitable under the plan after the termination of the plan (taking into consideration section 411(d)(3)).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determinations to be made under funding method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, normal costs, accrued liability, past service liabilities, and experience gains and losses shall be determined under the funding method used to determine costs under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Valuation of assets</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section, the value of the plan's assets shall be determined on the basis of any reasonable actuarial method of valuation which takes into account fair market value and which is permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Election with respect to bonds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The value of a bond or other evidence of indebtedness which is not in default as to principal or interest may, at the election of the plan administrator, be determined on an amortized basis running from initial cost at purchase to par value at maturity or earliest call date. Any election under this subparagraph shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulations provide, shall apply to all such evidences of indebtedness, and may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary. In the case of a plan other than a multiemployer plan, this subparagraph shall not apply, but the Secretary may by regulations provide that the value of any dedicated bond portfolio of such plan shall be determined by using the interest rate under subsection (b)(5).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Actuarial assumptions must be reasonable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, all costs, liabilities, rates of interest, and other factors under the plan shall be determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions and methods&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a plan other than a multiemployer plan, each of which is reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations) or which, in the aggregate, result in a total contribution equivalent to that which would be determined if each such assumption and method were reasonable, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a multiemployer plan, which, in the aggregate, are reasonable (taking into account the experiences of the plan and reasonable expectations), and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which, in combination, offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of certain changes as experience gain or loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a change in benefits under the Social Security Act or in other retirement benefits created under Federal or State law, or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:836 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a change in the definition of the term &ldquo;wages&rdquo; under section 3121, or a change in the amount of such wages taken into account under regulations prescribed for purposes of section 401(a)(5),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">results in an increase or decrease in accrued liability under a plan, such increase or decrease shall be treated as an experience loss or gain.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Change in funding method or in plan year requires approval</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the funding method for a plan is changed, the new funding method shall become the funding method used to determine costs and liabilities under the plan only if the change is approved by the Secretary. If the plan year for a plan is changed, the new plan year shall become the plan year for the plan only if the change is approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Approval required for certain changes in assumptions by certain single-employer plans subject to additional funding requirement</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">No actuarial assumption (other than the assumptions described in subsection (<em>l</em>)(7)(C)) used to determine the current liability for a plan to which this subparagraph applies may be changed without the approval of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Plans to which subparagraph applies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">This subparagraph shall apply to a plan only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the plan is a defined benefit plan (other than a multiemployer plan) to which title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 applies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the aggregate unfunded vested benefits as of the close of the preceding plan year (as determined under section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iii) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) of such plan and all other plans maintained by the contributing sponsors (as defined in section 4001(a)(13) of such Act) and members of such sponsors&rsquo; controlled groups (as defined in section 4001(a)(14) of such Act) which are covered by title IV of such Act (disregarding plans with no unfunded vested benefits) exceed $50,000,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the change in assumptions (determined after taking into account any changes in interest rate and mortality table) results in a decrease in the unfunded current liability of the plan for the current plan year that exceeds $50,000,000, or that exceeds $5,000,000 and that is 5 percent or more of the current liability of the plan before such change.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Full funding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, as of the close of a plan year, a plan would (without regard to this paragraph) have an accumulated funding deficiency (determined without regard to the alternative minimum funding standard account permitted under subsection (g)) in excess of the full funding limitation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the funding standard account shall be credited with the amount of such excess, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) all amounts described in paragraphs (2)(B), (C), and (D) and (3)(B) of subsection (b) which are required to be amortized shall be considered fully amortized for purposes of such paragraphs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the fair market value of the plan's assets, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the value of such assets determined under paragraph (2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) for the treatment under this section of contributions which would be required to be made under the plan but for the provisions of subparagraph (A)(i)(I).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Minimum amount</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In no event shall the full-funding limitation determined under subparagraph (A) be less than the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>

<!-- PDFPage:837 --><p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the value of the plan's assets determined under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Current liability; assets</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) assets shall not be reduced by any credit balance in the funding standard account.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Certain retroactive plan amendments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, any amendment applying to a plan year which&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall, at the election of the plan administrator, be deemed to have been made on the first day of such plan year. No amendment described in this paragraph which reduces the accrued benefits of any participant shall take effect unless the plan administrator files a notice with the Secretary of Labor notifying him of such amendment and the Secretary of Labor has approved such amendment, or within 90 days after the date on which such notice was filed, failed to disapprove such amendment. No amendment described in this subsection shall be approved by the Secretary of Labor unless he determines that such amendment is necessary because of a substantial business hardship (as determined under subsection (d)(2)) and that a waiver under subsection (d)(1) is unavailable or inadequate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Annual valuation</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A trust which is a part of a pension, profitsharing, or stock bonus plan shall not constitute a qualified trust under section 401(a) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a defined benefit plan, the plan provides for the payment of benefits with respect to a participant which exceed the limitation of subsection (b),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a defined contribution plan, contributions and other additions under the plan with respect to any participant for any taxable year exceed the limitation of subsection (c), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in any case in which an individual is a participant in both a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan maintained by the employer, the trust has been disqualified under subsection (g).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Section applies to certain annuities and accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an employee annuity plan described in section 403(a),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an annuity contract described in section 403(b), or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:869 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a simplified employee pension described in section 408(k),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">such a contract, plan, or pension shall not be considered to be described in section 403(a), 403(b), or 408(k), as the case may be, unless it satisfies the requirements of subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1), whichever is appropriate, and has not been disqualified under subsection (g). In the case of an annuity contract described in section 403(b), the preceding sentence shall apply only to the portion of the annuity contract which exceeds the limitation of subsection (b) or the limitation of subsection (c), whichever is appropriate, and the amount of the contribution for such portion shall reduce the exclusion allowance as provided in section 403(b)(2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation for defined benefit plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Benefits with respect to a participant exceed the limitation of this subsection if, when expressed as an annual benefit (within the meaning of paragraph (2)), such annual benefit is greater than the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) $90,000, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 100 percent of the participant's average compensation for his high 3 years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual benefit</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;annual benefit&rdquo; means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) under a plan to which employees do not contribute and under which no rollover contributions (as defined in sections 402(c), 403(a)(4), and 408(d)(3)) are made.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjustment for certain other forms of benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the benefit under the plan is payable in any form other than the form described in subparagraph (A), or if the employees contribute to the plan or make rollover contributions (as defined in sections 402(c), 403(a)(4), and 408(d)(3)), the determinations as to whether the limitation described in paragraph (1) has been satisfied shall be made, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary by adjusting such benefit so that it is equivalent to the benefit described in subparagraph (A). For purposes of this subparagraph, any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits shall not be taken into account; and that portion of any joint and survivor annuity which constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity (as defined in section 417) shall not be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Adjustment to $90,000 limit where benefit begins before the social security retirement age</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the retirement income benefit under the plan begins before the social security retirement age, the determination as to whether the $90,000 limitation set forth in paragraph (1)(A) has been satisfied shall be made, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by reducing the limitation of paragraph (1)(A) so that such limitation (as so reduced) equals an annual benefit (beginning when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $90,000 annual benefit beginning at the social security retirement age. The reduction under this subparagraph shall be made in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe which is consistent with the reduction for old-age insurance benefits commencing before the social security retirement age under the Social Security Act.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Adjustment to $90,000 limit where benefit begins after the social security retirement age</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the retirement income benefit under the plan begins after the social security retirement age, the determination as to whether the $90,000 limitation set forth in paragraph (1)(A) has been satisfied shall be made, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by increasing the limitation of paragraph (1)(A) so that such limitation (as so increased) equals an annual benefit (beginning when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $90,000 annual benefit beginning at the social security retirement age.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Limitation on certain assumptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), for purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation under subparagraph (B) or (C), the interest rate assumption shall not be less than the greater of 5 percent or the rate specified in the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For purposes of adjusting the benefit or limitation of any form of benefit subject to section 417(e)(3), the applicable interest rate (as defined in section 417(e)(3)) shall be substituted for &ldquo;5 percent&rdquo; in clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) For purposes of adjusting any limitation under subparagraph (D), the interest rate assumption shall not be greater than the lesser of 5 percent or the rate specified in the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) For purposes of this subsection, no adjustments under subsection (d)(1) shall be taken into account before the year for which such adjustment first takes effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) For purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation under subparagraph (B), (C), or (D), the mortality table used shall be the table prescribed by the Secretary. Such table shall be based on the prevailing commissioners&rsquo; standard table (described in section 807(d)(5)(A)) used to determine reserves for group annuity contracts issued on the date the adjustment is being made (without regard to any other subparagraph of section 807(d)(5)).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Plans maintained by governments and tax-exempt organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a governmental plan (within the meaning of section 414(d)), a plan maintained by an organization (other than a governmental unit) exempt from tax under this subtitle, or a qualified merchant marine plan&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:870 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) subparagraph (C) shall be applied&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) by substituting &ldquo;age 62&rdquo; for &ldquo;social security retirement age&rdquo; each place it appears, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) as if the last sentence thereof read as follows: &ldquo;The reduction under this subparagraph shall not reduce the limitation of paragraph (1)(A) below (i) $75,000 if the benefit begins at or after age 55, or (ii) if the benefit begins before age 55, the equivalent of the $75,000 limitation for age 55.&rdquo;, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) subparagraph (D) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;age 65&rdquo; for &ldquo;social security retirement age&rdquo; each place it appears.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;qualified merchant marine plan&rdquo; means a plan in existence on January 1, 1986, the participants in which are merchant marine officers holding licenses issued by the Secretary of Transportation under title 46, United States Code.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Special limitation for qualified police or firefighters</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a qualified participant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) subparagraph (C) shall not reduce the limitation of paragraph (1)(A) to an amount less than $50,000, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the rules of subparagraph (F) shall apply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The Secretary shall adjust the $50,000 amount in clause (i) at the same time and in the same manner as under section 415(d).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(H) Qualified participant defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (G), the term &ldquo;qualified participant&rdquo; means a participant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in a defined benefit plan which is maintained by a State or political subdivision thereof,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) with respect to whom the period of service taken into account in determining the amount of the benefit under such defined benefit plan includes at least 15 years of service of the participant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) as a full-time employee of any police department or fire department which is organized and operated by the State or political subdivision maintaining such defined benefit plan to provide police protection, firefighting services, or emergency medical services for any area within the jurisdiction of such State or political subdivision, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Average compensation for high 3 years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a participant's high 3 years shall be the period of consecutive calendar years (not more than 3) during which the participant both was an active participant in the plan and had the greatest aggregate compensation from the employer. In the case of an employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting for &ldquo;compensation from the employer&rdquo; the following: &ldquo;the participant's earned income (within the meaning of section 401(c)(2) but determined without regard to any exclusion under section 911)&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Total annual benefits not in excess of $10,000</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, the benefits payable with respect to a participant under any defined benefit plan shall be deemed not to exceed the limitation of this subsection if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the retirement benefits payable with respect to such participant under such plan and under all other defined benefit plans of the employer do not exceed $10,000 for the plan year, or for any prior plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the employer has not at any time maintained a defined contribution plan in which the participant participated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Reduction for participation or service of less than 10 years</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Dollar limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an employee who has less than 10 years of participation in a defined benefit plan, the limitation referred to in paragraph (1)(A) shall be the limitation determined under such paragraph (without regard to this paragraph) multiplied by a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the defined benefit plan of the employer, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the denominator of which is 10.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Compensation and benefits limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The provisions of subparagraph (A) shall apply to the limitations under paragraphs (1)(B) and (4) and subsection (e), except that such subparagraph shall be applied with respect to years of service with an employer rather than years of participation in a plan.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitation on reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In no event shall subparagraph (A) or (B) reduce the limitations referred to in paragraphs (1) and (4) to an amount less than 1/10 of such limitation (determined without regard to this paragraph).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Application to changes in benefit structure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent provided in regulations, subparagraph (A) shall be applied separately with respect to each change in the benefit structure of a plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Computation of benefits and contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The computation of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) benefits under a defined contribution plan, for purposes of section 401(a)(4),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) contributions made on behalf of a participant in a defined benefit plan, for purposes of section 401(a)(4), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) contributions and benefits provided for a participant in a plan described in section 414(k), for purposes of this section</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall not be made on a basis inconsistent with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Benefits under certain collectively bargained plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For a year, the limitation referred to in paragraph (1)(B) shall not apply to benefits <!-- PDFPage:871 -->with respect to a participant under a defined benefit plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which is maintained for such year pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between employee representatives and one or more employers,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which, at all times during such year, has at least 100 participants,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) under which benefits are determined solely by reference to length of service, the particular years during which service was rendered, age at retirement, and date of retirement,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) which provides that an employee who has at least 4 years of service has a nonforfeitable right to 100 percent of his accrued benefit derived from employer contributions, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) which requires, as a condition of participation in the plan, that an employee complete a period of not more than 60 consecutive days of service with the employer or employers maintaining the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">This paragraph shall not apply to a participant whose compensation for any 3 years during the 10-year period immediately preceding the year in which he separates from service exceeded the average compensation for such 3 years of all participants in such plan. This paragraph shall not apply to a participant for any period for which he is a participant under another plan to which this section applies which is maintained by an employer maintaining this plan. For any year for which the paragraph applies to benefits with respect to a participant, paragraph (1)(A) and subsection (d)(1)(A) shall be applied with respect to such participant by substituting the greater of $68,212 or one-half the amount otherwise applicable for such year under paragraph (1)(A) for &ldquo;$90,000&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Social security retirement age defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;social security retirement age&rdquo; means the age used as the retirement age under section 216(<em>l</em>) of the Social Security Act, except that such section shall be applied&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Individuals who separate from service before age 60</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;qualified participant&rdquo; means a participant who first became a participant in the plan maintained by the employer before January 1, 1990.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) it is established to the satisfaction of a plan representative that the consent required under subparagraph (A) may not be obtained because there is no spouse, because the spouse cannot be located, or because of such other circumstances as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Any consent by a spouse (or establishment that the consent of a spouse may not be obtained) under the preceding sentence shall be effective only with respect to such spouse.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) under the plan, the earliest period for which the surviving spouse may receive a payment under such annuity is not later than the month in which the participant would have attained the earliest retirement age under the plan.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Security interests taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), any security interest held by the plan by reason of a loan outstanding to the participant shall be taken into account in determining the amount of the qualified preretirement survivor annuity.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), a plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(11) merely because the plan provides that a qualified joint and survivor annuity (or a qualified preretirement survivor annuity) will not be provided unless the participant and spouse had been married throughout the 1-year period ending on the earlier of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the net charge to the funding standard account for such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Net charge to funding standard account</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Vested benefits charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The vested benefits charge for any plan year is the amount which would be necessary to amortize the plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the base plan year in equal annual installments&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) over 10 years, to the extent such benefits are attributable to persons in pay status, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) over 25 years, to the extent such benefits are attributable to other participants.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Determination of vested benefits charge</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Plan in reorganization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as otherwise determined by the Secretary, in determining the vested benefits charge for any plan year following any plan year in which the plan was in reorganization, any change in benefits&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) described in clause (i)(I), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) described in clause (i)(II) as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary,</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, any other person who is entitled to such a benefit under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Other definitions and special rules</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Unfunded vested benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;unfunded vested benefits&rdquo; means, in connection with a plan, an amount (determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary) equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the value of vested benefits under the plan, less</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the value of the assets of the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Vested benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;vested benefits&rdquo; means any nonforfeitable benefit (within the meaning of section 4001(a)(8) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Treatment of certain benefit reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The vested benefits charge shall be determined without regard to reductions in accrued benefits under section 418D which are first effective in the plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Withdrawal liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this part, any outstanding claim for withdrawal liability shall not be considered a plan asset, except as otherwise <!-- PDFPage:893 -->provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prohibition of nonannuity payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, while a plan is in reorganization a benefit with respect to a participant (other than a death benefit) which is attributable to employer contributions and which has a value of more than $1,750 may not be paid in a form other than an annuity which (by itself or in combination with social security, railroad retirement, or workers&rsquo; compensation benefits) provides substantially level payments over the life of the participant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Terminated plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any multiemployer plan which terminates under section 4041A(a)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 shall not be considered in reorganization after the last day of the plan year in which the plan is treated as having terminated.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;418C. Overburden credit against minimum contribution requirement</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining the contribution under section 418B (before the application of section 418B(b)(2) or (d)), the plan sponsor of a plan which is overburdened for the plan year shall apply an overburden credit against the plan's minimum contribution requirement for the plan year (determined without regard to section 418B(b)(2) or (d) and without regard to this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definition of overburdened plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A plan is overburdened for a plan year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the average number of pay status participants under the plan in the base plan year exceeds the average of the number of active participants in the base plan year and the 2 plan years preceding the base plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the rate of employer contributions under the plan equals or exceeds the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such rate for the preceding plan year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such rate for the plan year preceding the first year in which the plan is in reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount of overburden credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of the overburden credit for a plan year is the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) one-half of the average guaranteed benefit paid for the base plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the overburden factor for the plan year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The amount of the overburden credit for a plan year shall not exceed the amount of the minimum contribution requirement for such year (determined without regard to this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Overburden factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the overburden factor of a plan for the plan year is an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the average number of pay status participants for the base plan year, reduced by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the average of the number of active participants for the base plan year and for each of the 2 plan years preceding the base plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Pay status participant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;pay status participant&rdquo; means, with respect to a plan, a participant receiving retirement benefits under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Number of active participants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The number of active participants for a plan year shall be the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number of active employees who are participants in the plan and on whose behalf contributions are required to be made during the plan year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of active employees who are not participants in the plan but who are in an employment unit covered by a collective bargaining agreement which requires the employees&rsquo; employer to contribute to the plan unless service in such employment unit was never covered under the plan or a predecessor thereof, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the total number of active employees attributed to employers who made payments to the plan for the plan year of withdrawal liability pursuant to part 1 of subtitle E of title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, determined by dividing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the total amount of such payments, by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount equal to the total contributions received by the plan during the plan year divided by the average number of active employees who were participants in the plan during the plan year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Secretary shall by regulations provide alternative methods of determining active participants where (by reason of irregular employment, contributions on a unit basis, or otherwise) this paragraph does not yield a representative basis for determining the credit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Average number</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;average number&rdquo; means, with respect to pay status participants for a plan year, a number equal to one-half the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number with respect to the plan as of the beginning of the plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number with respect to the plan as of the end of the plan year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Average guaranteed benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The average guaranteed benefit paid is 12 times the average monthly pension payment guaranteed under section 4022A(c)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 determined under the provisions of the plan in effect at the beginning of the first plan year in which the plan is in reorganization and without regard to section 4022A(c)(2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) First year in reorganization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The first year in which the plan is in reorganization is the first of a period of 1 or more consecutive plan years in which the plan has been in reorganization not taking into account any plan years the plan was in reorganization prior to any period of 3 or more consecutive plan years in which the plan was not in reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) No overburden credit in case of certain reductions in contributions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a plan is not eligible for an overburden credit for a plan year if the Secretary <!-- PDFPage:897 -->finds that the plan's current contribution base for any plan year was reduced, without a corresponding reduction in the plan's unfunded vested benefits attributable to pay status participants, as a result of a change in an agreement providing for employer contributions under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of certain withdrawals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a complete or partial withdrawal of an employer (within the meaning of part 1 of subtitle E of title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) does not impair a plan's eligibility for an overburden credit, unless the Secretary finds that a contribution base reduction described in paragraph (1) resulted from a transfer of liabilities to another plan in connection with the withdrawal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Mergers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if 2 or more multiemployer plans merge, the amount of the overburden credit which may be applied under this section with respect to the plan resulting from the merger for any of the 3 plan years ending after the effective date of the merger shall not exceed the sum of the used overburden credit for each of the merging plans for its last plan year ending before the effective date of the merger. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the used overburden credit is that portion of the credit which does not exceed the excess of the minimum contribution requirement determined without regard to any overburden credit under this section over the employer contributions required under the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A plan which has been amended to reduce accrued benefits under this section may be amended to increase or restore accrued benefits, or the rate of future benefit accruals, only if the plan is amended to restore levels of previously reduced accrued benefits of inactive participants and of participants who are within 5 years of attaining normal retirement age to at least the same extent as any such increase in accrued benefits or in the rate of future benefit accruals.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Benefit increases and benefit restorations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, in the case of a plan which has been amended under this section to reduce accrued benefits&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an increase in a benefit, or in the rate of future benefit accruals, shall be considered a benefit increase to the extent that the benefit, or the accrual rate, is thereby increased above the highest benefit level, or accrual rate, which was in effect under the terms of the plan before the effective date of the amendment reducing accrued benefits, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an increase in a benefit, or in the rate of future benefit accruals, shall be considered a benefit restoration to the extent that the benefit, or the accrual rate, is not thereby increased above the highest benefit level, or accrual rate, which was in effect under the terms of the plan immediately before the effective date of the amendment reducing accrued benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Uniformity in benefit restoration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a plan is amended to partially restore previously reduced accrued benefit levels, or the rate of future benefit accruals, the benefits of inactive participants shall be restored in at least the same proportions as other accrued benefits which are restored.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) No benefit increases in year of benefit reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No benefit increase under a plan may take effect in a plan year in which an amendment reducing accrued benefits under the plan, in accordance with this section, is adopted or first becomes effective.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Retroactive payments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding section 411, in any case in which benefit payments under an insolvent multiemployer plan exceed the resource benefit level, any such payments of benefits which are not basic benefits shall be suspended, in accordance with this section, to the extent necessary to reduce the sum of such payments and the payments of such basic benefits to the greater of the resource benefit level or the level of basic benefits, unless an alternative procedure is prescribed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation under section 4022A(g)(5) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, for a plan year&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Insolvency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A multiemployer plan is insolvent if the plan's available resources are not sufficient to pay benefits under the plan when due for the plan year, or if the plan is determined to be insolvent under subsection (d).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;resource benefit level&rdquo; means the level of monthly benefits determined under <!-- PDFPage:899 -->subsections (c)(1) and (3) and (d)(3) to be the highest level which can be paid out of the plan's available resources.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Insolvency year</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determination of resource benefit level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization shall determine in writing the plan's resource benefit level for each insolvency year, based on the plan sponsor's reasonable projection of the plan's available resources and the benefits payable under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Uniformity of the benefit suspension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The suspension of benefit payments under this section shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, apply in substantially uniform proportions to the benefits of all persons in pay status (within the meaning of section 418(b)(6)) under the plan, except that the Secretary may prescribe rules under which benefit suspensions for different participant groups may be varied equitably to reflect variations in contribution rates and other relevant factors including differences in negotiated levels of financial support for plan benefit obligations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Resource benefit level below level of basic benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (2), if a plan sponsor determines in writing a resource benefit level for a plan year which is below the level of basic benefits, the payment of all benefits other than basic benefits shall be suspended for that plan year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Excess resources</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, by the end of an insolvency year, the plan sponsor determines in writing that the plan's available resources in that insolvency year could have supported benefit payments above the resource benefit level for that insolvency year, the plan sponsor shall distribute the excess resources to the participants and beneficiaries who received benefit payments from the plan in that insolvency year, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Excess resources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;excess resources&rdquo; means available resources above the amount necessary to support the resource benefit level, but no greater than the amount necessary to pay benefits for the plan year at the benefit levels under the plan.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Retroactive payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (4) or (5), a plan is not required to make retroactive benefit payments with respect to that portion of a benefit which was suspended under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Plan sponsor determination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Triennial test</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As of the end of the first plan year in which a plan is in reorganization, and at least every 3 plan years thereafter (unless the plan is no longer in reorganization), the plan sponsor shall compare the value of plan assets (determined in accordance with section 418B(b)(3)(B)(ii)) for that plan year with the total amount of benefit payments made under the plan for that plan year. Unless the plan sponsor determines that the value of plan assets exceeds 3 times the total amount of benefit payments, the plan sponsor shall determine whether the plan will be insolvent in any of the next 3 plan years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of insolvency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, at any time, the plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization reasonably determines, taking into account the plan's recent and anticipated financial experience, that the plan's available resources are not sufficient to pay benefits under the plan when due for the next plan year, the plan sponsor shall make such determination available to interested parties.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determination of resource benefit level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization shall determine in writing for each insolvency year the resource benefit level and the level of basic benefits no later than 3 months before the insolvency year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Notice requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Impending insolvency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization determines under subsection (d)(1) or (2) that the plan may become insolvent (within the meaning of subsection (b)(1)), the plan sponsor shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) notify the Secretary, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the parties described in section 418A(a)(2), and the plan participants and beneficiaries of that determination, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) inform the parties described in section 418A(a)(2) and the plan participants and beneficiaries that if insolvency occurs certain benefit payments will be suspended, but that basic benefits will continue to be paid.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Resource benefit level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No later than 2 months before the first day of each insolvency year, the plan sponsor of a <!-- PDFPage:900 -->plan in reorganization shall notify the Secretary, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the parties described in section 418A(a)(2), and the plan participants and beneficiaries of the resource benefit level determined in writing for that insolvency year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Potential need for financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which the plan sponsor anticipates that the resource benefit level for an insolvency year may not exceed the level of basic benefits, the plan sponsor shall notify the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notice required by this subsection shall be given in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, except that notice to the Secretary shall be given in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Mandatory application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A plan sponsor who has determined a resource benefit level for an insolvency year which is below the level of basic benefits shall apply for financial assistance from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation under section 4261 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any amount of any financial assistance from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to any plan, and any repayment of such amount, shall be taken into account under this subpart in such manner as determined by the Secretary.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Effect of qualifying transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a share of stock is transferred to an individual in a transfer in respect of which the requirements of section 422(a) or 423(a) are met&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no income shall result at the time of the transfer of such share to the individual upon his exercise of the option with respect to such share;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) no deduction under section 162 (relating to trade or business expenses) shall be allowable at any time to the employer corporation, a parent or subsidiary corporation of such corporation, or a corporation issuing or assuming a stock option in a transaction to which section 424(a) applies, with respect to the share so transferred; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) no amount other than the price paid under the option shall be considered as received by any of such corporations for the share so transferred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Effect of disqualifying disposition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the transfer of a share of stock to an individual pursuant to his exercise of an option would otherwise meet the requirements of section 422(a) or 423(a) except that there is a failure to meet any of the holding period requirements of section 422(a)(1) or 423(a)(1), then any increase in the income of such individual or deduction from the income of his employer corporation for the taxable year in which such exercise occurred attributable to such disposition, shall be treated as an increase in income or a deduction from income in the taxable year of such individual or of such employer corporation in which such disposition occurred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exercise by estate</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an option to which this part applies is exercised after the death of the employee by the estate of the decedent, or by a person who acquired the right to exercise such option by bequest or inheritance or by reason of the death of the decedent, the provisions of subsection (a) shall apply to the same extent as if the option had been exercised by the decedent, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the holding period and employment requirements of sections 422(a) and 423(a) shall not apply, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any transfer by the estate of stock acquired shall be considered a disposition of such stock for purposes of section 423(c).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Deduction for estate tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an amount is required to be included under section 423(c) in gross income of the estate of the deceased employee or of a person described in paragraph (1), there shall be allowed to the estate or such person a deduction with respect to the estate tax attributable to the inclusion in the taxable estate of the deceased employee of the net value for estate tax purposes of the option. For this purpose, the deduction shall be determined under section 691(c) as if the option acquired from the deceased employee were an item of gross income in respect of the decedent under section 691 and as if the amount includible in gross income under section 423(c) were an amount included in gross income under section 691 in respect of such item of gross income.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Basis of shares acquired</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a share of stock acquired by the exercise of an option to which paragraph (1) applies&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the basis of such share shall include so much of the basis of the option as is attributable to such share; except that the basis of such share shall be reduced by the excess (if any) of (i) the amount which would have been includible in gross income under section 423(c) if the employee had exercised the option on the date of his death and had held the share acquired pursuant to such exercise at the time of his death, over (ii) the amount which is includible in gross income under such section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the last sentence of section 423(c) shall apply only to the extent that the amount includible in gross income under such section exceeds so much of the basis of the option as is attributable to such share.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Section 421(a) shall apply with respect to the transfer of a share of stock to an individual pursuant to his exercise of an incentive stock option if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no disposition of such share is made by him within 2 years from the date of the granting of the option nor within 1 year after the transfer of such share to him, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) at all times during the period beginning on the date of the granting of the option and ending on the day 3 months before the date of such exercise, such individual was an employee of either the corporation granting such option, a parent or subsidiary corporation of such corporation, or a corporation or a parent or subsidiary corporation of such corporation issuing or assuming a stock option in a transaction to which section 424(a) applies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Incentive stock option</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;incentive stock option&rdquo; means an option granted to an individual for any reason connected with his employment by a corporation, if granted by the employer corporation or its parent or subsidiary corporation, to purchase stock of any of such corporations, but only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the option is granted pursuant to a plan which includes the aggregate number of shares which may be issued under options and the employees (or class of employees) eligible to receive options, and which is approved by the stockholders of the granting corporation within 12 months before or after the date such plan is adopted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such option is granted within 10 years from the date such plan is adopted, or the date such plan is approved by the stockholders, whichever is earlier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such option by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the date such option is granted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the option price is not less than the fair market value of the stock at the time such option is granted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) such option by its terms is not transferable by such individual otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable, during his lifetime, only by him; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:911 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) such individual, at the time the option is granted, does not own stock possessing more than 10 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the employer corporation or of its parent or subsidiary corporation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such term shall not include any option if (as of the time the option is granted) the terms of such option provide that it will not be treated as an incentive stock option.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Good faith efforts to value of stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a share of stock is transferred pursuant to the exercise by an individual of an option which would fail to qualify as an incentive stock option under subsection (b) because there was a failure in an attempt, made in good faith, to meet the requirement of subsection (b)(4), the requirement of subsection (b)(4) shall be considered to have been met. To the extent provided in regulations by the Secretary, a similar rule shall apply for purposes of subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain disqualifying dispositions where amount realized is less than value at exercise</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an individual who has acquired a share of stock by the exercise of an incentive stock option makes a disposition of such share within either of the periods described in subsection (a)(1), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such disposition is a sale or exchange with respect to which a loss (if sustained) would be recognized to such individual,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then the amount which is includible in the gross income of such individual, and the amount which is deductible from the income of his employer corporation, as compensation attributable to the exercise of such option shall not exceed the excess (if any) of the amount realized on such sale or exchange over the adjusted basis of such share.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certain transfers by insolvent individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an insolvent individual holds a share of stock acquired pursuant to his exercise of an incentive stock option, and if such share is transferred to a trustee, receiver, or other similar fiduciary in any proceeding under title 11 or any other similar insolvency proceeding, neither such transfer, nor any other transfer of such share for the benefit of his creditors in such proceeding, shall constitute a disposition of such share for purposes of subsection (a)(1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Permissible provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An option which meets the requirements of subsection (b) shall be treated as an incentive stock option even if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the employee may pay for the stock with stock of the corporation granting the option,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the employee has a right to receive property at the time of exercise of the option, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the option is subject to any condition not inconsistent with the provisions of subsection (b).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Subparagraph (B) shall apply to a transfer of property (other than cash) only if section 83 applies to the property so transferred.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) 10-percent shareholder rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (b)(6) shall not apply if at the time such option is granted the option price is at least 110 percent of the fair market value of the stock subject to the option and such option by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of 5 years from the date such option is granted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Special rule when disabled</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (a)(2), in the case of an employee who is disabled (within the meaning of section 22(e)(3)), the 3-month period of subsection (a)(2) shall be 1 year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Fair market value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the fair market value of stock shall be determined without regard to any restriction other than a restriction which, by its terms, will never lapse.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) $100,000 per year limitation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent that the aggregate fair market value of stock with respect to which incentive stock options (determined without regard to this subsection) are exercisable for the 1st time by any individual during any calendar year (under all plans of the individual's employer corporation and its parent and subsidiary corporations) exceeds $100,000, such options shall be treated as options which are not incentive stock options.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Ordering rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall be applied by taking options into account in the order in which they were granted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determination of fair market value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the fair market value of any stock shall be determined as of the time the option with respect to such stock is granted.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;423. Employee stock purchase plans</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Section 421(a) shall apply with respect to the transfer of a share of stock to an individual pursuant to his exercise of an option granted after December 31, 1963, under an employee stock purchase plan (as defined in subsection (b)) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no disposition of such share is made by him within 2 years after the date of the granting of the option nor within 1 year after the transfer of such share to him; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) at all times during the period beginning with the date of the granting of the option and ending on the day 3 months before the date of such exercise, he is an employee of the corporation granting such option, a parent or subsidiary corporation of such corporation, or a corporation or a parent or subsidiary corporation of such corporation issuing or assuming a stock option in a transaction to which section 424(a) applies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Employee stock purchase plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;employee stock purchase plan&rdquo; means a plan which meets the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the plan provides that options are to be granted only to employees of the employer corporation or of its parent or subsidiary corporation to purchase stock in any such corporation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such plan is approved by the stockholders of the granting corporation within 12 months before or after the date such plan is adopted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) under the terms of the plan, no employee can be granted an option if such employee, immediately after the option is granted, owns stock possessing 5 percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the employer corporation or of its parent or subsidiary corporation. For purposes of this paragraph, the rules of section 424(d) shall apply in determining the stock ownership of an individual, and stock which the employee may purchase under outstanding options shall be treated as stock owned by the employee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) under the terms of the plan, options are to be granted to all employees of any corporation whose employees are granted any of such options by reason of their employment by such corporation, except that there may be excluded&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) employees who have been employed less than 2 years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) employees whose customary employment is 20 hours or less per week,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) employees whose customary employment is for not more than 5 months in any calendar year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q));</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) under the terms of the plan, all employees granted such options shall have the same rights and privileges, except that the amount of stock which may be purchased by any employee under such option may bear a uniform relationship to the total compensation, or the basic or regular rate of compensation, of employees, and the plan may provide that no employee may purchase more than a maximum amount of stock fixed under the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) under the terms of the plan, the option price is not less than the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an amount equal to 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock at the time such option is granted, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an amount which under the terms of the option may not be less than 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock at the time such option is exercised;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) under the terms of the plan, such option cannot be exercised after the expiration of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 5 years from the date such option is granted if, under the terms of such plan, the option price is to be not less than 85 percent of the fair market value of such stock at the time of the exercise of the option, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 27 months from the date such option is granted, if the option price is not determinable in the manner described in subparagraph (A)</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) under the terms of the plan, no employee may be granted an option which permits his rights to purchase stock under all such plans of his employer corporation and its parent and subsidiary corporations to accrue at a rate which exceeds $25,000 of fair market value of <!-- PDFPage:914 -->such stock (determined at the time such option is granted) for each calendar year in which such option is outstanding at any time. For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the right to purchase stock under an option accrues when the option (or any portion thereof) first becomes exercisable during the calendar year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the right to purchase stock under an option accrues at the rate provided in the option, but in no case may such rate exceed $25,000 of fair market value of such stock (determined at the time such option is granted) for any one calendar year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a right to purchase stock which has accrued under one option granted pursuant to the plan may not be carried over to any other option; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) under the terms of the plan, such option is not transferable by such individual otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable, during his lifetime, only by him.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of paragraphs (3) to (9), inclusive, where additional terms are contained in an offering made under a plan, such additional terms shall, with respect to options exercised under such offering, be treated as a part of the terms of such plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rule where option price is between 85 percent and 100 percent of value of stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the option price of a share of stock acquired by an individual pursuant to a transfer to which subsection (a) applies was less than 100 percent of the fair market value of such share at the time such option was granted, then, in the event of any disposition of such share by him which meets the holding period requirements of subsection (a), or in the event of his death (whenever occurring) while owning such share, there shall be included as compensation (and not as gain upon the sale or exchange of a capital asset) in his gross income, for the taxable year in which falls the date of such disposition or for the taxable year closing with his death, whichever applies, an amount equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the excess of the fair market value of the share at the time of such disposition or death over the amount paid for the share under the option, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the excess of the fair market value of the share at the time the option was granted over the option price.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the option price is not fixed or determinable at the time the option is granted, then for purposes of this subsection, the option price shall be determined as if the option were exercised at such time. In the case of the disposition of such share by the individual, the basis of the share in his hands at the time of such disposition shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount so includible in his gross income.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the new option or the assumption of the old option does not give the employee additional benefits which he did not have under the old option.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The acquisition of a share of stock in the name of the employee and another jointly with the right of survivorship or a subsequent transfer of a share of stock into such joint ownership shall not be deemed a disposition, but a termination of such joint tenancy (except to the extent such employee acquires ownership of such stock) shall be treated as a disposition by him occurring at the time such joint tenancy is terminated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule where incentive stock is acquired through use of other statutory option stock</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the fair market value of such stock on the date of the making of such modification, extension, or renewal, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the fair market value of such stock at the time of the making of any intervening modification, extension, or renewal.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Definition of modification</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) attributable to the issuance or assumption of an option under subsection (a);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to permit the option to qualify under section 423(b)(9); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of an option not immediately exercisable in full, to accelerate the time at which the option may be exercised.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Stockholder approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, if the grant of an option is subject to approval by stockholders, the date of grant of the option shall be determined as if the option had not been subject to such approval.</p>
