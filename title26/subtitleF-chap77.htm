<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Mailing of deposits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Date of deposit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any deposit required to be made (pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary under section 6302(c)) on or before a prescribed date is, after such date, delivered by the United States mail to the bank, trust company, domestic building and loan association, or credit union authorized to receive such deposit, such deposit shall be deemed received by such bank, trust company, domestic building and loan association, or credit union on the date the deposit was mailed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any reference in this section to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any designated delivery service, and any reference in this section to a postmark by the United States Postal Service shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked as described in paragraph (2)(C) by any designated delivery service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Designated delivery service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;designated delivery service&rdquo; means any delivery service provided by a trade or business if such service is designated by the Secretary for purposes of this section. The Secretary <!-- PDFPage:3520 -->may designate a delivery service under the preceding sentence only if the Secretary determines that such service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is available to the general public,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is at least as timely and reliable on a regular basis as the United States mail,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the excess of the product of&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the net required payment balance.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, for any applicable election year, the amount determined under subsection (b)(2) exceeds the amount determined under subsection (b)(1), the entity shall be entitled to a refund of such excess for such year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the aggregate amount of such applicable payments made during the deferral period of the base year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;deferral ratio&rdquo; means the ratio which the number of months in the deferral period of the base year bears to the number of months in the partnership's or S corporation's taxable year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a partnership, net income shall be the amount (not below zero) determined by taking into account the aggregate amount of the partnership's items described in section 702(a) (other than credits and tax-exempt income).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) S corporations</h4>

If the S corporation was a C corporation for the base year, its taxable income for such year shall be treated as its net income for such year (and such corporation shall be treated as an S corporation for such taxable year for purposes of paragraph (3)).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Certain limitations disregarded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A) or (B), any limitation on the amount of any item described in either such paragraph which may be taken into account for purposes of computing the taxable income of a partner or shareholder shall be disregarded.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph, the applicable percentage for any partnership or S corporation shall be 100 percent unless more than 50 percent of such entity's net income for the short taxable year which would have resulted if the entity had not made an election under section 444 would have been allocated to partners or shareholders who would have been entitled to the benefits of section 806(e)(2)(C) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 with respect to such income.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Treatment of guaranteed payments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any guaranteed payment by a partnership shall not be treated as an applicable payment, and the amount of the net income of the partnership shall be determined by not taking such guaranteed payment into account.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Safeguards</h4>
