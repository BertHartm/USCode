<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Treatment of distributions and stock dispositions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a United States person receives an excess distribution in respect of stock in a passive foreign investment company, then&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of the excess distribution shall be allocated ratably to each day in the taxpayer's holding period for the stock,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with respect to such excess distribution, the taxpayer's gross income for the current year shall include (as ordinary income) only the amounts allocated under subparagraph (A) to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the current year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any period in the taxpayer's holding period before the 1st day of the 1st taxable year of the company which begins after December 31, 1986, and for which it was a passive foreign investment company, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the tax imposed by this chapter for the current year shall be increased by the deferred tax amount (determined under subsection (c)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Dispositions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the taxpayer disposes of stock in a passive foreign investment company, then the rules of paragraph (1) shall apply to any gain recognized on such disposition in the same manner as if such gain were an excess distribution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Holding period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The taxpayer's holding period shall be determined under section 1223; except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for purposes of applying this section to an excess distribution, such holding period shall be treated as ending on the date of such distribution, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if section 1296 applied to such stock with respect to the taxpayer for any prior taxable year, such holding period shall be treated as beginning on the first day of the first taxable year beginning after the last taxable year for which section 1296 so applied.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Current year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;current year&rdquo; means the taxable year in which the excess distribution or disposition occurs.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;excess distribution&rdquo; means any distribution in respect of stock received during any taxable year to the extent such distribution does not exceed its ratable portion of the total excess distribution (if any) for such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Total excess distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;total excess distribution&rdquo; means the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount of the distributions in respect of the stock received by the taxpayer during the taxable year, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 125 percent of the average amount received in respect of such stock by the taxpayer during the 3 preceding taxable years (or, if shorter, the portion of the taxpayer's holding period before the taxable year).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of clause (ii), any excess distribution received during such 3-year period shall be taken into account only to the extent it was included in gross income under subsection (a)(1)(B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) No excess for 1st year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The total excess distributions with respect to any stock shall be zero for the taxable year in which the taxpayer's holding period in such stock begins.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) determinations under this subsection shall be made on a share-by-share basis, except that shares with the same holding period may be aggregated,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) proper adjustments shall be made for stock splits and stock dividends,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if the taxpayer does not hold the stock during the entire taxable year, distributions received during such year shall be annualized,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) if the taxpayer's holding period includes periods during which the stock was held by another person, distributions received by such other person shall be taken into account as if received by the taxpayer,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) if the distributions are received in a foreign currency, determinations under this subsection shall be made in such currency and the amount of any excess distribution determined in such currency shall be translated into dollars,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) proper adjustment shall be made for amounts not includible in gross income by reason of section 551(d), 959(a), or 1293(c), and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1787 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) if a charitable deduction was allowable under section 642(c) to a trust for any distribution of its income, proper adjustments shall be made for the deduction so allowable to the extent allocable to distributions or gain in respect of stock in a passive foreign investment company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Deferred tax amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;deferred tax amount&rdquo; means, with respect to any distribution or disposition to which subsection (a) applies, an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the aggregate increases in taxes described in paragraph (2), plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the aggregate amount of interest (determined in the manner provided under paragraph (3)) on such increases in tax.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Any increase in the tax imposed by this chapter for the current year under subsection (a) to the extent attributable to the amount referred to in subparagraph (B) shall be treated as interest paid under section 6601 on the due date for the current year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Aggregate increases in taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the aggregate increases in taxes shall be determined by multiplying each amount allocated under subsection (a)(1)(A) to any taxable year (other than any taxable year referred to in subsection (a)(1)(B)) by the highest rate of tax in effect for such taxable year under section 1 or 11, whichever applies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Computation of interest</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of interest referred to in paragraph (1)(B) on any increase determined under paragraph (2) for any taxable year shall be determined for the period&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) beginning on the due date for such taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) ending on the due date for the taxable year with or within which the distribution or disposition occurs,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">by using the rates and method applicable under section 6621 for underpayments of tax for such period.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Due date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;due date&rdquo; means the date prescribed by law (determined without regard to extensions) for filing the return of the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Coordination with subparts B and C</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This section shall not apply with respect to any distribution paid by a passive foreign investment company, or any disposition of stock in a passive foreign investment company, if such company is a qualified electing fund with respect to the taxpayer for each of its taxable years&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which begins after December 31, 1986, and for which such company is a passive foreign investment company, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which includes any portion of the taxpayer's holding period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Except as provided in section 1296(j), this section also shall not apply if an election under section 1296(k) is in effect for the taxpayer's taxable year. In the case of stock which is marked to market under section 475 or any other provision of this chapter, this section shall not apply, except that rules similar to the rules of section 1296(j) shall apply.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Election to recognize gain where company becomes qualified electing fund</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a passive foreign investment company becomes a qualified electing fund with respect to the taxpayer for a taxable year which begins after December 31, 1986,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the taxpayer holds stock in such company on the first day of such taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary the fair market value of such stock on such first day,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the taxpayer may elect to recognize gain as if he sold such stock on such first day for such fair market value.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the taxpayer holds stock in such company on the first day of such taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) such company is a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957(a)),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;the taxpayer may elect to include in gross income as a dividend received on such first day an amount equal to the portion of the post-1986 earnings and profits of such company attributable (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) to the stock in such company held by the taxpayer on such first day. The amount treated as a dividend under the preceding sentence shall be treated as an excess distribution and shall be allocated under subsection (a)(1)(A) only to days during periods taken into account in determining the post-1986 earnings and profits so attributable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of section 959(e), any amount included in gross income under <!-- PDFPage:1788 -->this subparagraph shall be treated as included in gross income under section 1248(a).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any stock to which subparagraph (A) or (B) applies&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the adjusted basis of such stock shall be increased by the gain recognized under subparagraph (A) or the amount treated as a dividend under subparagraph (B), as the case may be, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the taxpayer's holding period in such stock shall be treated as beginning on the first day referred to in such subparagraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the reduction under subsection (e) of such section shall be the excess of the basis determined under section 1014 over the adjusted basis of the stock immediately before the decedent's death, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such a reduction shall not apply in the case of a decedent who was a nonresident alien at all times during his holding period in the stock.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Recognition of gain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent provided in regulations, in the case of any transfer of stock in a passive foreign investment company where (but for this subsection) there is not full recognition of gain, the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the fair market value of such stock, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) its adjusted basis,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such stock and shall be recognized notwithstanding any provision of law. Proper adjustment shall be made to the basis of any such stock for gain recognized under the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Coordination with foreign tax credit rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of such distribution shall be determined for purposes of this section with regard to section 78,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the excess distribution taxes shall be allocated ratably to each day in the taxpayer's holding period for the stock, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to the extent&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) that such excess distribution taxes are allocated to a taxable year referred to in subsection (a)(1)(B), such taxes shall be taken into account under section 901 for the current year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) that such excess distribution taxes are allocated to any other taxable year, such taxes shall reduce (subject to the principles of section 904(d) and not below zero) the increase in tax determined under subsection (c)(2) for such taxable year by reason of such distribution (but such taxes shall not be taken into account under section 901).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Definitions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;excess distribution taxes&rdquo; means, with respect to any distribution, the portion of the creditable foreign taxes with respect to such distribution which is attributable (on a pro rata basis) to the portion of such distribution which is an excess distribution.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Section 1248 gain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The rules of this subsection also shall apply in the case of any gain which but for this section would be includible in gross income as a dividend under section 1248.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1293. Current taxation of income from qualified electing funds</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Inclusion</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Every United States person who owns (or is treated under section 1298(a) as owning) stock of a qualified electing fund at any time during the taxable year of such fund shall include in gross income&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) as ordinary income, such shareholder's pro rata share of the ordinary earnings of such fund for such year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as long-term capital gain, such shareholder's pro rata share of the net capital gain of such fund for such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Year of inclusion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The inclusion under paragraph (1) shall be for the taxable year of the shareholder in which or with which the taxable year of the fund ends.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Pro rata share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The pro rata share referred to in subsection (a) in the case of any shareholder is the amount which would have been distributed with respect to the shareholder's stock if, on each day during the taxable year of the fund, the fund had distributed to each shareholder a pro rata share of that day's ratable share of the fund's ordinary earnings and net capital gain for such year. To the extent provided in regulations, if the fund establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it uses a shorter period than the taxable year to determine shareholders&rsquo; interests in the earnings of such fund, pro rata shares may be determined by using such shorter period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Previously taxed amounts distributed tax free</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that any amount distributed by <!-- PDFPage:1790 -->a passive foreign investment company is paid out of earnings and profits of the company which were included under subsection (a) in the income of any United States person, such amount shall be treated, for purposes of this chapter, as a distribution which is not a dividend; except that such distribution shall immediately reduce earnings and profits. If the passive foreign investment company is a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957(a)), the preceding sentence shall not apply to any United States shareholder (as defined in section 951(b)) in such corporation, and, in applying section 959 to any such shareholder, any inclusion under this section shall be treated as an inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Basis adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The basis of the taxpayer's stock in a passive foreign investment company shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) increased by any amount which is included in the income of the taxpayer under subsection (a) with respect to such stock, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) decreased by any amount distributed with respect to such stock which is not includible in the income of the taxpayer by reason of subsection (c).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A similar rule shall apply also in the case of any property if by reason of holding such property the taxpayer is treated under section 1298(a) as owning stock in a qualified electing fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Ordinary earnings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Ordinary earnings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;ordinary earnings&rdquo; means the excess of the earnings and profits of the qualified electing fund for the taxable year over its net capital gain for such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation on net capital gain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A qualified electing fund's net capital gain for any taxable year shall not exceed its earnings and profits for such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determination of earnings and profits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The earnings and profits of any qualified electing fund shall be determined without regard to paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of section 312(n). Under regulations, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent it would increase earnings and profits by an amount which was previously distributed by the qualified electing fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Foreign tax credit allowed in the case of 10-percent corporate shareholder</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of section 960&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any amount included in the gross income under subsection (a) shall be treated as if it were included under section 951(a), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any amount excluded from gross income under subsection (c) shall be treated in the same manner as amounts excluded from gross income under section 959.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Other special rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Exception for certain income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of determining the amount included in the gross income of any person under this section, the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of a qualified electing fund shall not include any item of income received by such fund if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such fund is a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957(a)) and such person is a United States shareholder (as defined in section 951(b)) in such fund, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such person establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such income was subject to an effective rate of income tax imposed by a foreign country greater than 90 percent of the maximum rate of tax specified in section 11, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such income is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) from sources within the United States,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) effectively connected with the conduct by the qualified electing fund of a trade or business in the United States, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) not exempt from taxation (or subject to a reduced rate of tax) pursuant to a treaty obligation of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prevention of double inclusion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe such adjustment to the provisions of this section as may be necessary to prevent the same item of income of a qualified electing fund from being included in the gross income of a United States person more than once.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At the election of the taxpayer, the time for payment of any undistributed PFIC earnings tax liability of the taxpayer for the taxable year shall be extended to the extent and subject to the limitations provided in this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Election not permitted where amounts otherwise includible under section 551 or 951</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The taxpayer may not make an election under paragraph (1) with respect to the undistributed PFIC earnings tax liability attributable to a qualified electing fund for the taxable year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any amount is includible in the gross income of the taxpayer under section 551 with respect to such fund for such taxable year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any amount is includible in the gross income of the taxpayer under section 951 with respect to such fund for such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Undistributed PFIC earnings tax liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;undistributed PFIC earnings tax liability&rdquo; means, in the case of any taxpayer, the excess of&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Termination of extension</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Distributions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a distribution is not includible in gross income for the taxable year by reason of section 1293(c), then the extension under subsection (a) for payment of the undistributed PFIC earnings tax liability with respect to the earnings to which such distribution is attributable shall expire on the last date prescribed by law (determined without regard to extensions) for filing the return of tax for such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Ordering rule</h4>

To the extent provided in regulations, the preceding sentence shall not apply in the case of a transfer in a transaction with respect to which gain or loss is not recognized (in whole or in part), and the transferee in such transaction shall succeed to the treatment under this section of the transferor.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The election under subsection (a) shall be made not later than the time prescribed by law (including extensions) for filing the return of tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Authority to require bond</h4>
