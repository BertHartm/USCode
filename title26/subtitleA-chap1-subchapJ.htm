<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) income accumulated in trust for the benefit of unborn or unascertained persons or persons with contingent interests, and income accumulated or held for future distribution under the terms of the will or trust;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) income which is to be distributed currently by the fiduciary to the beneficiaries, and income collected by a guardian of an infant which is to be held or distributed as the court may direct;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation and payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The taxable income of an estate or trust shall be computed in the same manner as in the case of an individual, except as otherwise provided in this part.

For purposes of this subsection, a foreign trust or foreign estate shall be treated as a nonresident alien individual who is not present in the United States at any time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exclusion of includible gain from taxable income</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this part, the taxable income of a trust does not include the amount of any includible gain as defined in section 644(b)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#641_1_target" name="641_1">1</a></sup> reduced by any deductions properly allocable thereto.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Cross reference</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the portion of any electing small business trust which consists of stock in 1 or more S corporations shall be treated as a separate trust, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such separate trust shall be determined with the modifications of paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Modifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the modifications of this paragraph are the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Except as provided in section 1(h), the amount of the tax imposed by section 1(e) shall be determined by using the highest rate of tax set forth in section 1(e).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The exemption amount under section 55(d) shall be zero.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The only items of income, loss, deduction, or credit to be taken into account are the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on the portion of any electing small business trust not treated as a separate trust under paragraph (1), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the distributable net income of the entire trust,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the items referred to in paragraph (2)(C) shall be excluded. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this subsection shall not affect the taxation of any distribution from the trust.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of unused deductions where termination of separate trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a portion of an electing small business trust ceases to be treated as a separate trust under paragraph (1), any carryover or excess deduction of the separate trust which is referred to in section 642(h) shall be taken into account by the entire trust.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Electing small business trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;electing small business trust&rdquo; has the meaning given such term by section 1361(e)(1).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Foreign tax credit allowed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An estate or trust shall be allowed the credit against tax for taxes imposed by foreign countries and possessions of the United States, to the extent allowed by section 901, only in respect of so much of the taxes described in such section as is not properly allocable under such section to the beneficiaries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deduction for personal exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An estate shall be allowed a deduction of $600. A trust which, under its governing instrument, is required to distribute all of its income currently shall be allowed a deduction of $300. All other trusts shall be allowed a deduction of $100. The deductions allowed by this subsection shall be in lieu of the deductions allowed under section 151 (relating to deduction for personal exemption).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Deduction for amounts paid or permanently set aside for a charitable purpose</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an estate or trust (other then&nbsp;<sup><a href="#642_1_target" name="642_1">1</a></sup> a trust meeting the specifications of subpart B), there shall be allowed as a deduction in computing its taxable income (in lieu of the deduction allowed by section 170(a), relating to deduction for charitable, etc., contributions and gifts) any amount of the gross income, without limitation, which pursuant to the terms of the governing instrument is, during the taxable year, paid for a purpose specified in section 170(c) (determined without regard to section 170(c)(2)(A)). If a charitable contribution is paid after the close of such taxable year and on or before the last day of the year following the close of such taxable year, then the trustee or administrator may elect to treat such contribution as paid during such taxable year. The election shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary prescribes by regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amounts permanently set aside</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an estate, and in the case of a trust (other than a trust meeting the specifications of subpart B) required by the terms of its governing instrument to set aside amounts which was&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) created on or before October 9, 1969, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an irrevocable remainder interest is transferred to or for the use of an organization described in section 170(c), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the grantor is at all times after October 9, 1969, under a mental disability to change the terms of the trust; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) established by a will executed on or before October 9, 1969, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the testator dies before October 9, 1972, without having republished the will after October 9, 1969, by codicil or otherwise,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the testator at no time after October 9, 1969, had the right to change the portions of the will which pertain to the trust, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the will is not republished by codicil or otherwise before October 9, 1972, and the testator is on such date and at all times thereafter under a mental disability to republish the will by codicil or otherwise,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">there shall also be allowed as a deduction in computing its taxable income any amount of the gross income, without limitation, which pursuant to the terms of the governing instrument is, during the taxable year, permanently set aside for a purpose specified in section 170(c), or is to be used exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, or for the establishment, acquisition, maintenance, or operation of a public cemetery not operated for profit. In the case of a trust, the preceding sentence shall apply only to gross income earned with respect to amounts transferred to the trust before October 9, 1969, or transferred under a will to which subparagraph (B) applies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Pooled income funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a pooled income fund (as defined in paragraph (5)), there shall also be allowed as a deduction in computing its taxable income any amount of the gross income attributable to gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than 1 year, without limitation, which pursuant to the terms of the governing instrument is, during the taxable year, permanently set aside for a purpose specified in section 170(c).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent that the amount otherwise allowable as a deduction under this subsection consists of gain described in section 1202(a), proper adjustment shall be made for any exclusion allowable to the estate or trust under section 1202. In the case of a trust, the deduction allowed by this subsection shall be sub<!-- PDFPage:1229 -->ject to section 681 (relating to unrelated business income).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Definition of pooled income fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (3), a pooled income fund is a trust&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to which each donor transfers property, contributing an irrevocable remainder interest in such property to or for the use of an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A) (other than in clauses (vii) or (viii)), and retaining an income interest for the life of one or more beneficiaries (living at the time of such transfer),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in which the property transferred by each donor is commingled with property transferred by other donors who have made or make similar transfers,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) which cannot have investments in securities which are exempt from the taxes imposed by this subtitle,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) which includes only amounts received from transfers which meet the requirements of this paragraph,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) which is maintained by the organization to which the remainder interest is contributed and of which no donor or beneficiary of an income interest is a trustee, and</p>

Losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets shall be excluded, except to the extent such losses are taken into account in determining the amount of gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets which are paid, credited, or required to be distributed to any beneficiary during the taxable year. The exclusion under section 1202 shall not be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Extraordinary dividends and taxable stock dividends</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes only of subpart B (relating to trusts which distribute current income only), there shall be excluded those items of gross income constituting extraordinary dividends or taxable stock dividends which the fiduciary, acting in good faith, does not pay or credit to any beneficiary by reason of his determination that such dividends are allocable to corpus under the terms of the governing instrument and applicable local law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the value (determined under section 7520) of such remainder interest is at least 10 percent of the initial net fair market value of all property placed in the trust.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Charitable remainder unitrust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, a charitable remainder unitrust is a trust&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1241 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) from which a fixed percentage (which is not less than 5 percent nor more than 50 percent) of the net fair market value of its assets, valued annually, is to be paid, not less often than annually, to one or more persons (at least one of which is not an organization described in section 170(c) and, in the case of individuals, only to an individual who is living at the time of the creation of the trust) for a term of years (not in excess of 20 years) or for the life or lives of such individual or individuals,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) from which no amount other than the payments described in subparagraph (A) and other than qualified gratuitous transfers described in subparagraph (C) may be paid to or for the use of any person other than an organization described in section 170(c),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) with respect to each contribution of property to the trust, the value (determined under section 7520) of such remainder interest in such property is at least 10 percent of the net fair market value of such property as of the date such property is contributed to the trust.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (2)(A) and (B), the trust instrument may provide that the trustee shall pay the income beneficiary for any year&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any amount of the trust income which is in excess of the amount required to be distributed under paragraph (2)(A), to the extent that (by reason of subparagraph (A)) the aggregate of the amounts paid in prior years was less than the aggregate of such required amounts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Severance of certain additional contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any contribution is made to a trust which before the contribution is a charitable remainder unitrust, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such contribution would (but for this paragraph) result in such trust ceasing to be a charitable unitrust by reason of paragraph (2)(D),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">such contribution shall be treated as a transfer to a separate trust under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Valuation for purposes of charitable contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining the amount of any charitable contribution, the remainder interest of a charitable remainder annuity trust or charitable remainder unitrust shall be computed on the basis that an amount equal to 5 percent of the net fair market value of its assets (or a greater amount, if required under the terms of the trust instrument) is to be distributed each year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Certain contingencies permitted</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Value determined without regard to qualified contingency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of determining the amount of any charitable contribution (or the actuarial value of any interest), a qualified contingency shall not be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Qualified contingency</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Qualified gratuitous transfer of qualified employer securities</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;qualified gratuitous transfer&rdquo; means a transfer of qualified employer securities to an employee stock ownership plan (as defined in section 4975(e)(7)) but only to the extent that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the securities transferred previously passed from a decedent dying before January 1, 1999, to a trust described in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (d),</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Plan requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A plan contains the provisions required by this paragraph if such plan provides that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) on termination of the plan, all securities so transferred which are not allocated to plan participants as of such termination are to be transferred to, or for the use of, an organization described in section 170(c).</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the plan shall be treated as having distributed (at the time of such allocation) to such person or shareholder the amount so allocated.</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Amount allocated</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a trust which is subject to subpart C, the amount of the accumulation distribution of such trust for a taxable year shall be deemed to be an amount within the meaning of paragraph (2) of section 661(a) distributed on the last day of each of the preceding taxable years, commencing with the earliest of such years, to the extent that such amount exceeds the total of any undistributed net income for all earlier preceding taxable years. The amount deemed to be distributed in any such preceding taxable year under the preceding sentence shall not exceed the undistributed net income for such preceding taxable year. For purposes of this subsection, undistributed net income for each of such preceding taxable years shall be computed without regard to such accumulation distribution and without regard to any accumulation distribution determined for any succeeding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Total taxes deemed distributed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any portion of an accumulation distribution for any taxable year is deemed under subsection (a) to be an amount within the meaning of paragraph (2) of section 661(a) distributed on the last day of any preceding taxable year, and such portion of such distribution is not less than the undistributed net income for such preceding taxable year, the trust shall be deemed to have distributed on the last day of such preceding taxable year an additional amount within the meaning of paragraph (2) of section 661(a). Such additional amount shall be equal to the taxes (other than the tax imposed by section 55) imposed on the trust for such preceding taxable year attributable to the undistributed net income. For purposes of this subsection, the undistributed net income and the taxes imposed on the trust for such preceding taxable year attributable to such undistributed net income shall be computed without regard to such accumulation distribution and without regard to any accumulation distribution determined for any succeeding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Pro rata portion of taxes deemed distributed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any portion of an accumulation distribution for any taxable year is deemed under subsection (a) to be an amount within the meaning of paragraph (2) of section 661(a) distributed on the last day of any preceding taxable year and such portion of the accumulation distribution is less than the undistributed net income for such preceding taxable year, the trust shall be deemed to have distributed on the last day of such preceding taxable year an additional amount within the meaning of paragraph (2) of section 661(a). Such additional amount shall be equal to the taxes (other than the tax imposed by section 55) imposed on the trust for such taxable year attributable to the undistributed net income multiplied by the ratio of the portion of the accumulation distribution to the undistributed net income of the trust for such year. For purposes of this subsection, the undistributed net income and the taxes imposed on the trust for such preceding taxable year attributable to such undistributed net income shall be computed without regard to the accumulation distribution and without regard to any accumulation distribution determined for any succeeding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rule when information is not available</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If adequate records are not available to determine the proper application of this subpart to an amount distributed by a trust, such amount shall be deemed to be an accumulation distribution consisting of undistributed net income earned during the earliest preceding taxable year of the trust in which it can be established that the trust was in existence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Denial of refund to trusts and beneficiaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No refund or credit shall be allowed to a trust or a beneficiary of such trust for any preceding <!-- PDFPage:1247 -->taxable year by reason of a distribution deemed to have been made by such trust in such year under this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;667. Treatment of amounts deemed distributed by trust in preceding years</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The total of the amounts which are treated under section 666 as having been distributed by a trust in a preceding taxable year shall be included in the income of a beneficiary of the trust when paid, credited, or required to be distributed to the extent that such total would have been included in the income of such beneficiary under section 662(a)(2) (and, with respect to any tax-exempt interest to which section 103 applies, under section 662(b)) if such total had been paid to such beneficiary on the last day of such preceding taxable year. The tax imposed by this subtitle on a beneficiary for a taxable year in which any such amount is included in his income shall be determined only as provided in this section and shall consist of the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a partial tax computed on the taxable income reduced by an amount equal to the total of such amounts, at the rate and in the manner as if this section had not been enacted,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a partial tax determined as provided in subsection (b) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of a foreign trust, the interest charge determined as provided in section 668.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Tax on distribution</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The partial tax imposed by subsection (a)(2) shall be determined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by determining the number of preceding taxable years of the trust on the last day of which an amount is deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by taking from the 5 taxable years immediately preceding the year of the accumulation distribution the 1 taxable year for which the beneficiary's taxable income was the highest and the 1 taxable year for which his taxable income was the lowest,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) by adding to the beneficiary's taxable income for each of the 3 taxable years remaining after the application of subparagraph (B) an amount determined by dividing the amount deemed distributed under section 666 and required to be included in income under subsection (a) by the number of preceding taxable years determined under subparagraph (A), and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1248 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) by determining the average increase in tax for the 3 taxable years referred to in subparagraph (C) resulting from the application of such subparagraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The partial tax imposed by subsection (a)(2) shall be the excess (if any) of the average increase in tax determined under subparagraph (D), multiplied by the number of preceding taxable years determined under subparagraph (A), over the amount of taxes (other than the amount of taxes described in section 665(d)(2)) deemed distributed to the beneficiary under sections 666(b) and (c).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of loss years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the taxable income of the beneficiary for any taxable year shall be deemed to be not less than zero.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certain preceding taxable years not taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), if the amount of the undistributed net income deemed distributed in any preceding taxable year of the trust is less than 25 percent of the amount of the accumulation distribution divided by the number of preceding taxable years to which the accumulation distribution is allocated under section 666(a), the number of preceding taxable years of the trust with respect to which an amount is deemed distributed to a beneficiary under section 666(a) shall be determined without regard to such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Effect of other accumulation distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In computing the partial tax under paragraph (1) for any beneficiary, the income of such beneficiary for each of his prior taxable years shall include amounts previously deemed distributed to such beneficiary in such year under section 666 as a result of prior accumulation distributions (whether from the same or another trust).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Multiple distributions in the same taxable year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of accumulation distributions made from more than one trust which are includible in the income of a beneficiary in the same taxable year, the distributions shall be deemed to have been made consecutively in whichever order the beneficiary shall determine.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Adjustment in partial tax for estate and generation-skipping transfer taxes attributable to partial tax</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The partial tax shall be reduced by an amount which is equal to the pre-death portion of the partial tax multiplied by a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the numerator of which is that portion of the tax imposed by chapter 11 or 13, as the case may be, which is attributable (on a proportionate basis) to amounts included in the accumulation distribution, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the denominator of which is the amount of the accumulation distribution which is subject to the tax imposed by chapter 11 or 13, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Partial tax determined without regard to this paragraph</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;partial tax&rdquo; means the partial tax imposed by subsection (a)(2) determined under this subsection without regard to this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Pre-death portion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the pre-death portion of the partial tax shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the partial tax as the portion of the accumulation distribution which is attributable to the period before the date of the death of the decedent or the date of the generation-skipping transfer bears to the total accumulation distribution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rule for multiple trusts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, in the same prior taxable year of the beneficiary in which any part of the accumulation distribution from a trust (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as &ldquo;third trust&rdquo;) is deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed to such beneficiary, some part of prior distributions by each of 2 or more other trusts is deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed to such beneficiary, then subsections (b) and (c) of section 666 shall not apply with respect to such part of the accumulation distribution from such third trust.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Accumulation distributions from trust not taken into account unless they equal or exceed $1,000</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), an accumulation distribution from a trust to a beneficiary shall be taken into account only if such distribution, when added to any prior accumulation distributions from such trust which are deemed under section 666(a) to have been distributed to such beneficiary for the same prior taxable year of the beneficiary, equals or exceeds $1,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rules for foreign trust</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Foreign tax deemed paid by beneficiary</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining the increase in tax under subsection (b)(1)(D) for any computation year, the taxes described in section 665(d)(2) which are deemed distributed under section 666(b) or (c) and added under subsection (b)(1)(C) to the taxable income of the beneficiary for any computation year shall, except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), be treated as a credit against the increase in tax for such computation year under subsection (b)(1)(D).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Deduction in lieu of credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the beneficiary did not choose the benefits of subpart A of part III of subchapter N with respect to the computation year, the beneficiary may in lieu of treating the amounts described in subparagraph (A) (without regard to subparagraph (C)) as a credit may treat such amounts as a deduction in computing the beneficiary's taxable income under subsection (b)(1)(C) for the computation year.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1249 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitation on credit; retention of character</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Limitation on credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of determining under subparagraph (A) the amount treated as a credit for any computation year, the limitations under subpart A of part III of subchapter N shall be applied separately with respect to amounts added under subsection (b)(1)(C) to the taxable income of the beneficiary for such computation year. For purposes of computing the increase in tax under subsection (b)(1)(D) for any computation year for which the beneficiary did not choose the benefits of subpart A of part III of subchapter N, the beneficiary shall be treated as having chosen such benefits for such computation year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Retention of character</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The items of income, deduction, and credit of the Trust shall retain their character (subject to the application of section 904(f)(5)) to the extent necessary to apply this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Computation year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;computation year&rdquo; means any of the three taxable years remaining after application of subsection (b)(1)(B).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Retention of character of amounts distributed from accumulation trust to nonresident aliens and foreign corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a distribution from a trust to a nonresident alien individual or to a foreign corporation, the first sentence of subsection (a) shall be applied as if the reference to the determination of character under section 662(b) applied to all amounts instead of just to tax-exempt interest.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the period described in this paragraph is the period which begins on the date which is the applicable number of years before the date of the distribution and which ends on the date of the distribution.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Certain revocable and irrevocable trusts</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Power to apply income to support of a dependent</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Power affecting beneficial enjoyment only after occurrence of event</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A power, the exercise of which can only affect the beneficial enjoyment of the income for a period commencing after the occurrence of an event such that a grantor would not be treated as the owner under section 673 if the power were a reversionary interest; but the grantor may be treated as the owner after the occurrence of the event unless the power is relinquished.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Power exercisable only by will</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A power exercisable only by will, other than a power in the grantor to appoint by will the income of the trust where the income is accumulated for such disposition by the grantor or may be so accumulated in the discretion of the grantor or a nonadverse party, or both, without the approval or consent of any adverse party.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Power to allocate among charitable beneficiaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A power to determine the beneficial enjoyment of the corpus or the income therefrom if the corpus or income is irrevocably payable for a purpose specified in section 170(c) (relating to definition of charitable contributions) or to an employee stock ownership plan (as defined in section 4975(e)(7)) in a qualified gratuitous transfer (as defined in section 664(g)(1)).</p>

A power does not fall within the powers described in this paragraph if any person has a power to add to the beneficiary or beneficiaries or to a class of beneficiaries designated to receive the income or corpus except where such action is to provide for after-born or after-adopted children.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Power to withhold income during disability of a beneficiary</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exception for certain powers of independent trustees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) shall not apply to a power solely exercisable (without the approval or consent of any other person) by a trustee or trustees, none of whom is the grantor, and no more than half of whom are related or subordinate parties who are subservient to the wishes of the grantor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to distribute, apportion, or accumulate income to or for a beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to, for, or within a class of beneficiaries; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A power does not fall within the powers described in this subsection if any person has a power to add to the beneficiary or beneficiaries or to a class of beneficiaries designated to receive the income or corpus, except where such action is to provide for after-born or after-adopted children.

A power does not fall within the powers described in this subsection if any person has a power to add to the beneficiary or beneficiaries or to a class of beneficiaries designated to receive the income or corpus except where such action is to provide for after-born or after-adopted children.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) subparts B, C, D, and E shall not apply, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) no deduction shall be allowed by section 642(b).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Qualified funeral trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;qualified funeral trust&rdquo; means any trust (other than a foreign trust) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the trust arises as a result of a contract with a person engaged in the trade or business of providing funeral or burial services or property necessary to provide such services,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the sole purpose of the trust is to hold, invest, and reinvest funds in the trust and to use such funds solely to make payments for such services or property for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the only beneficiaries of such trust are individuals with respect to whom such services or property are to be provided at their death under contracts described in paragraph (1),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the only contributions to the trust are contributions by or for the benefit of such beneficiaries,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the trustee elects the application of this subsection, and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Dollar limitation on contributions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;qualified funeral trust&rdquo; shall not include any trust which accepts aggregate contributions by or for the benefit of an individual in excess of $7,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Related trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), all trusts having trustees which are related persons shall be treated as 1 trust. For purposes of the preceding sentence, persons are related if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such persons are treated as a single employer under subsection (a) or (b) of section 52, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Secretary determines that treating such persons as related is necessary to prevent avoidance of the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Inflation adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any contract referred to in subsection (b)(1) which is entered into during any calendar year after 1998, the dollar amount referred to paragraph (1) shall be increased by an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such dollar amount, multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for such calendar year, by substituting &ldquo;calendar year 1997&rdquo; for &ldquo;calendar year 1992&rdquo; in subparagraph (B) thereof.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If any dollar amount after being increased under the preceding sentence is not a multiple of $100, such dollar amount shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $100.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Section 1(e) shall be applied to each qualified funeral trust by treating each beneficiary's interest in each such trust as a separate trust.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Treatment of amounts refunded to purchaser on cancellation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No gain or loss shall be recognized to a purchaser of a contract described in subsection (b)(1) by reason of any payment from such trust to such purchaser by reason of cancellation of <!-- PDFPage:1262 -->such contract. If any payment referred to in the preceding sentence consists of property other than money, the basis of such property in the hands of such purchaser shall be the same as the trust's basis in such property immediately before the payment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Simplified reporting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may prescribe rules for simplified reporting of all trusts having a single trustee.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;691. Recipients of income in respect of decedents</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Inclusion in gross income</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of all items of gross income in respect of a decedent which are not properly includible in respect of the taxable period in which falls the date of his death or a prior period (including the amount of all items of gross income in respect of a prior decedent, if the right to receive such amount was acquired by reason of the death of the prior decedent or by bequest, devise, or inheritance from the prior decedent) shall be included in the gross income, for the taxable year when received, of:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the estate of the decedent, if the right to receive the amount is acquired by the decedent's estate from the decedent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the person who, by reason of the death of the decedent, acquires the right to receive the amount, if the right to receive the amount is not acquired by the decedent's estate from the decedent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the person who acquires from the decedent the right to receive the amount by bequest, devise, or inheritance, if the amount is received after a distribution by the decedent's estate of such right.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Income in case of sale, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a right, described in paragraph (1), to receive an amount is transferred by the estate of the decedent or a person who received such right by reason of the death of the decedent or by bequest, devise, or inheritance from the decedent, there shall be included in the gross income of the estate or such person, as the case may be, for the taxable period in which the transfer occurs, the fair market value of such right at the time of such transfer plus the amount by which any consideration for the transfer exceeds such fair market value. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; includes sale, exchange, or other disposition, or the satisfaction of an installment obligation at other than face value, but does not include transmission at death to the estate of the decedent or a transfer to a person pursuant to the right of such person to receive such amount by reason of the death of the decedent or by bequest, devise, or inheritance from the decedent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Character of income determined by reference to decedent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The right, described in paragraph (1), to receive an amount shall be treated, in the hands of the estate of the decedent or any person who acquired such right by reason of the death of the decedent, or by bequest, devise, or inheritance from the decedent, as if it had been acquired by the estate or such person in the transaction in which the right to receive the income was originally derived and the amount includible in gross income under paragraph (1) or (2) shall be considered in the hands of the estate or such person to have the character which it would have had in the hands of the decedent if the decedent had lived and received such amount.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Installment obligations acquired from decedent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an installment obligation reportable by the decedent on the installment method under section 453, if such obligation is acquired by the decedent's estate from the decedent or by any person by reason of the death of the decedent or by bequest, devise, or inheritance from the decedent&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an amount equal to the excess of the face amount of such obligation over the basis of the obligation in the hands of the decedent (determined under section 453B) shall, for the purpose of paragraph (1), be considered as an item of gross income in respect of the decedent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such obligation shall, for purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3), be considered a right to receive an item of gross income in respect of the decedent, but the amount includible in gross income under paragraph (2) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the basis of the obligation in the hands of the decedent (determined under section 453B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Other rules relating to installment obligations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an installment obligation reportable by the decedent on the installment method under section 453, for purposes of paragraph (2)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the second sentence of paragraph (2) shall be applied by inserting &ldquo;(other than the obligor)&rdquo; after &ldquo;or a transfer to a person&rdquo;,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any cancellation of such an obligation shall be treated as a transfer, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) any cancellation of such an obligation occurring at the death of the decedent shall be treated as a transfer by the estate of the decedent (or, if held by a person other than the decedent before the death of the decedent, by such person).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1263 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Face amount treated as fair market value in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case to which the first sentence of paragraph (2) applies by reason of subparagraph (A), if the decedent and the obligor were related persons (within the meaning of section 453(f)(1)), the fair market value of the installment obligation shall be treated as not less than its face amount.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Cancellation includes becoming unenforceable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), an installment obligation which becomes unenforceable shall be treated as if it were canceled.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allowance of deductions and credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of any deduction specified in section 162, 163, 164, 212, or 611 (relating to deductions for expenses, interest, taxes, and depletion) or credit specified in section 27 (relating to foreign tax credit), in respect of a decedent which is not properly allowable to the decedent in respect of the taxable period in which falls the date of his death, or a prior period, shall be allowed:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Expenses, interest, and taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a deduction specified in sections 162, 163, 164, or 212 and a credit specified in section 27, in the taxable year when paid&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to the estate of the decedent; except that</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the estate of the decedent is not liable to discharge the obligation to which the deduction or credit relates, to the person who, by reason of the death of the decedent or by bequest, devise, or inheritance acquires, subject to such obligation, from the decedent an interest in property of the decedent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Depletion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of the deduction specified in section 611, to the person described in subsection (a)(1)(A), (B), or (C) who, in the manner described therein, receives the income to which the deduction relates, in the taxable year when such income is received.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Deduction for estate tax</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Allowance of deduction</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A person who includes an amount in gross income under subsection (a) shall be allowed, for the same taxable year, as a deduction an amount which bears the same ratio to the estate tax attributable to the net value for estate tax purposes of all the items described in subsection (a)(1) as the value for estate tax purposes of the items of gross income or portions thereof in respect of which such person included the amount in gross income (or the amount included in gross income, whichever is lower) bears to the value for estate tax purposes of all the items described in subsection (a)(1).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Estates and trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an estate or trust, the amount allowed as a deduction under subparagraph (A) shall be computed by excluding from the gross income of the estate or trust the portion (if any) of the items described in subsection (a)(1) which is properly paid, credited, or to be distributed to the beneficiaries during the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Method of computing deduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The term &ldquo;estate tax&rdquo; means the tax imposed on the estate of the decedent or any prior decedent under section 2001 or 2101, reduced by the credits against such tax.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The net value for estate tax purposes of all the items described in subsection (a)(1) shall be the excess of the value for estate tax purposes of all the items described in subsection (a)(1) over the deductions from the gross estate in respect of claims which represent the deductions and credit described in subsection (b). Such net value shall be determined with respect to the provisions of section 421(c)(2), relating to the deduction for estate tax with respect to stock options to which part II of subchapter D applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The estate tax attributable to such net value shall be an amount equal to the excess of the estate tax over the estate tax computed without including in the gross estate such net value.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule for generation-skipping transfers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any tax imposed by chapter 13 on a taxable termination or a direct skip occurring as a result of the death of the transferor, there shall be allowed a deduction (under principles similar to the principles of this subsection) for the portion of such tax attributable to items of gross income of the trust which were not properly includible in the gross income of the trust for periods before the date of such termination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Coordination with capital gain provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of sections 1(h), 1201, 1202, and 1211, the amount of any gain taken into account with respect to any item described in subsection (a)(1) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of the deduction allowable under paragraph (1) of this subsection with respect to such item.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Coordination with section 402(d)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of section 402(d) (other than paragraph (1)(C) thereof), the total taxable amount of any lump sum distribution shall be reduced by the amount of the deduction allowable under paragraph (1) of this subsection which is attributable to the total taxable amount (determined without regard to this paragraph).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amounts received by surviving annuitant under joint and survivor annuity contract</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Deduction for estate tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of computing the deduction under subsection (c)(1)(A), amounts received by a surviving annuitant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) as an annuity under a joint and survivor annuity contract where the decedent annuitant died after December 31, 1953, and <!-- PDFPage:1264 -->after the annuity starting date (as defined in section 72(c)(4)), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) during the surviving annuitant's life expectancy period, shall, to the extent included in gross income under section 72, be considered as amounts included in gross income under subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Net value for estate tax purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the net value for estate tax purposes under subsection (c)(2)(B) for purposes of this subsection, the value for estate tax purposes of the items described in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be computed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by determining the excess of the value of the annuity at the date of the death of the deceased annuitant over the total amount excludable from the gross income of the surviving annuitant under section 72 during the surviving annuitant's life expectancy period, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by multiplying the figure so obtained by the ratio which the value of the annuity for estate tax purposes bears to the value of the annuity at the date of the death of the deceased.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The term &ldquo;life expectancy period&rdquo; means the period beginning with the first day of the first period for which an amount is received by the surviving annuitant under the contract and ending with the close of the taxable year with or in which falls the termination of the life expectancy of the surviving annuitant. For purposes of this subparagraph, the life expectancy of the surviving annuitant shall be determined, as of the date of the death of the deceased annuitant, with reference to actuarial tables prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The surviving annuitant's expected return under the contract shall be computed, as of the death of the deceased annuitant, with reference to actuarial tables prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
