The preceding sentence shall not apply if the individual elects not to have such sentence apply. Such an election, once made, shall be irrevocable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Authority to exempt individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to an individual who is described in a category of individuals prescribed by regulation by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Regulations</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary establishes that it is reasonable to believe that an individual's loss of United States citizenship would, but for this section, result in a substantial reduction for the taxable year in the taxes on his probable income for such year, the burden of proving for such taxable year that such loss of citizenship did not have for one of its principal purposes the avoidance of taxes under this subtitle or subtitle B shall be on such individual.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the President finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) under the laws of any foreign country, considering the tax system of such foreign country, citizens of the United States not residents of such foreign country or domestic corporations are being subjected to more burdensome taxes, on any item of income received by such citizens or corporations from sources within such foreign country, than taxes imposed by the provisions of this subtitle on similar income derived from sources within the United States by residents or corporations of such foreign country,</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1493 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such foreign country, when requested by the United States to do so, has not acted to revise or reduce such taxes so that they are no more burdensome than taxes imposed by the provisions of this subtitle on similar income derived from sources within the United States by residents or corporations of such foreign country, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) it is in the public interest to apply pre-1967 tax provisions in accordance with the provisions of this subsection to residents or corporations of such foreign country,</p>

In implementing a proclamation made under this subsection, the effective rate of tax imposed by this subtitle on an item of income may be adjusted by the disallowance, in whole or in part, of any deduction, credit, or exemption which would otherwise be allowed with respect to that item of income or by increasing the rate of tax otherwise applicable to that item of income.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the laws of any foreign country with respect to which the President has made a proclamation under subsection (b) have been modified so that citizens of the United States or domestic corporations (or any class of such citizens or corporations) are no longer subject to a higher effective rate of tax on the item of income,</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Reduction in amount allowed as foreign tax under section 901</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In applying section 901, the amount of any oil and gas extraction taxes paid or accrued (or deemed to have been paid) during the taxable year which would (but for this subsection) be taken into account for purposes of section 901 shall be reduced by the amount (if any) by which the amount of such taxes exceeds the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount of the foreign oil and gas extraction income for the taxable year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) multiplied by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a corporation, the percentage which is equal to the highest rate of tax specified under section 11(b), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of an individual, a fraction the numerator of which is the tax against which the credit under section 901(a) is taken and the denominator of which is the taxpayer's entire taxable income.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Foreign taxes on foreign oil related income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subtitle, in the case of taxes paid or accrued to any foreign country with respect to foreign oil related income, the term &ldquo;income, war profits, and excess profits taxes&rdquo; shall not include any amount paid or accrued after December 31, 1982, to the extent that the Secretary determines that the foreign law imposing such amount of tax is structured, or in fact operates, so that the amount of tax imposed with respect to foreign oil related income will generally be materially greater, over a reasonable period of time, than the amount generally imposed on income that is neither foreign oil related income nor foreign oil and gas extraction income. In computing the amount not treated as tax under this subsection, such amount shall be treated as a deduction under the foreign law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Foreign income definitions and special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Foreign oil and gas extraction income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;foreign oil and gas extraction income&rdquo; means the taxable income derived from sources without the United States and its possessions from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the extraction (by the taxpayer or any other person) of minerals from oil or gas wells, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the sale or exchange of assets used by the taxpayer in the trade or business described in subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Such term does not include any dividend or interest income which is passive income (as defined in section 904(d)(2)(A)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Foreign oil related income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;foreign oil related income&rdquo; means the taxable income derived from sources outside the United States and its possessions from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the processing of minerals extracted (by the taxpayer or by any other person) from oil or gas wells into their primary products,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the transportation of such minerals or primary products,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the distribution or sale of such minerals or primary products,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the disposition of assets used by the taxpayer in the trade or business described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the performance of any other related service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Such term does not include any dividend or interest income which is passive income (as defined in section 904(d)(2)(A)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Dividends, interest, partnership distribution, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;foreign oil and gas extraction income&rdquo; and the term &ldquo;foreign oil related income&rdquo; include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) dividends and interest from a foreign corporation in respect of which taxes are deemed paid by the taxpayer under section 902,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) amounts with respect to which taxes are deemed paid under section 960(a), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the taxpayer's distributive share of the income of partnerships.<sup><a href="#907_1_target" name="907_1">1</a></sup></p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">to the extent such dividends, interest, amounts, or distributive share is attributable to foreign oil and gas extraction income, or to foreign oil related income, as the case may be; except that interest described in subparagraph (A) shall not be taken into account in computing foreign oil and gas extraction income but shall be taken into account in computing foreign oil-related income.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Recapture of foreign oil and gas extraction losses by recharacterizing later extraction income</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">That portion of the income of the taxpayer for the taxable year which (but for this paragraph) would be treated as foreign oil and gas extraction income shall be treated as income (from sources without the United States) which is not foreign oil and gas extraction income to the extent of the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the aggregate amount of foreign oil extraction losses for preceding taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) so much of such aggregate amount as was recharacterized under this subparagraph for preceding taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Foreign oil extraction loss defined</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;foreign oil extraction loss&rdquo; means the amount by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the gross income for the taxable year from sources without the United States and its possessions (whether or not the taxpayer chooses the benefits of <!-- PDFPage:1531 -->this subpart for such taxable year) taken into account in determining the foreign oil and gas extraction income for such year, is exceeded by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the sum of the deductions properly apportioned or allocated thereto.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Net operating loss deduction not taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), the net operating loss deduction allowable for the taxable year under section 172(a) shall not be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Expropriation and casualty losses not taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), there shall not be taken into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) any foreign expropriation loss (as defined in section 172(h) (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990)) for the taxable year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) any loss for the taxable year which arises from fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, or from theft,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;to the extent such loss is not compensated for by insurance or otherwise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Oil and gas extraction taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;oil and gas extraction taxes&rdquo; means any income, war profits, and excess profits tax paid or accrued (or deemed to have been paid under section 902 or 960) during the taxable year with respect to foreign oil and gas extraction income (determined without regard to paragraph (4)) or loss which would be taken into account for purposes of section 901 without regard to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Disregard of certain posted prices, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this chapter, in determining the amount of taxable income in the case of foreign oil and gas extraction income, if the oil or gas is disposed of, or is acquired other than from the government of a foreign country, at a posted price (or other pricing arrangement) which differs from the fair market value for such oil or gas, such fair market value shall be used in lieu of such posted price (or other pricing arrangement).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">[(e) Repealed. Pub. L. 101&ndash;508, title XI, &sect;11801(a)(32), Nov. 5, 1990, 104 Stat. 1388&ndash;521]</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Carryback and carryover of disallowed credits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the amount of the oil and gas extraction taxes paid or accrued during any taxable year exceeds the limitation provided by subsection (a) for such taxable year (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;unused credit year&rdquo;), such excess shall be deemed to be oil and gas extraction taxes paid or accrued in the second preceding taxable year, in the first preceding taxable year, and in the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth succeeding taxable year, in that order and to the extent not deemed tax paid or accrued in a prior taxable year by reason of the limitation imposed by paragraph (2). Such amount deemed paid or accrued in any taxable year may be availed of only as a tax credit and not as a deduction and only if the taxpayer for such year chooses to have the benefits of this subpart as to taxes paid or accrued for that year to foreign countries or possessions. For purposes of this subsection, the terms &ldquo;second preceding taxable year&rdquo;, and &ldquo;first preceding taxable year&rdquo; do not include any taxable year ending before January 1, 1975.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the unused oil and gas extraction taxes which under paragraph (1) may be deemed paid or accrued in any preceding or succeeding taxable year shall not exceed the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount by which the limitation provided by subsection (a) for such taxable year exceeds the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the oil and gas extraction taxes paid or accrued during such taxable year, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amounts of the oil and gas extraction taxes which by reason of this subsection are deemed paid or accrued in such taxable year and are attributable to taxable years preceding the unused credit year; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount by which the limitation provided by section 904 for such taxable year exceeds the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the taxes paid or accrued (or deemed to have been paid under section 902 or 960) to all foreign countries and possessions of the United States during such taxable year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of such taxes which were deemed paid or accrued in such taxable year under section 904(c) and which are attributable to taxable years preceding the unused credit year, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the amount of the oil and gas extraction taxes which by reason of this subsection are deemed paid or accrued in such taxable year and are attributable to taxable years preceding the unused credit year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the case of any taxable year which is an unused credit year under this subsection and which is an unused credit year under section 904(c), the provisions of this subsection shall be applied before section 904(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of determining the amount of taxes paid or accrued in any taxable year which may be deemed paid or accrued in a preceding or succeeding taxable year under section 904(c), any tax deemed paid or accrued in such preceding or succeeding taxable year under this subsection shall be considered to be tax paid or accrued in such preceding or succeeding taxable year.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exclusion of United States income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a controlled foreign corporation, subpart F income does not include any item of income from sources within the United States which is effectively connected with the conduct by such corporation of a trade or business within the United States unless such item is exempt from taxation (or is subject to a reduced rate of tax) pursuant to a treaty obligation of the United States. For purposes of the preceding sentence, income described in paragraph (2) or (3) of section 921(d) shall be treated as derived from sources within the United States.

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Qualified deficit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The term &ldquo;qualified deficit&rdquo; means any deficit in earnings and profits of the controlled foreign corporation for any prior taxable year which began after December 31, 1986, and for which the controlled foreign corporation was a controlled foreign corporation; but only to the extent such deficit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is attributable to the same qualified activity as the activity giving rise to the income being offset, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) has not previously been taken into account under this subparagraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;In determining the deficit attributable to qualified activities described in clause (iii)(III) or (IV), deficits in earnings and profits (to the extent not previously taken into account under this section) for taxable years beginning after 1962 and before 1987 also shall be taken into account. In the case of the qualified activity described in clause (iii)(II), the rule of the preceding sentence shall apply, except that &ldquo;1982&rdquo; shall be substituted for &ldquo;1962&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(VI) in the case of a qualified financial institution, foreign personal holding company income.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Pro rata share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this paragraph, the shareholder's pro rata share of any deficit for any prior taxable year shall be determined under rules similar to rules under section 951(a)(2) for whichever of the following yields the smaller share:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the close of the taxable year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the close of the taxable year in which the deficit arose.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">An election may be made under this clause to have section 953(a) applied for purposes of this title without regard to the same country exception under paragraph (1)(A) thereof. Such election, once made, may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Special rules for affiliated groups</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">In the case of an affiliated group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1504 but without regard to section 1504(b)(3) and by substituting &ldquo;more than 50 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;at least 80 percent&rdquo; each place it appears), no election may be made under subclause (I) for any controlled foreign corporation unless such election is made for all other controlled foreign corporations who are members of such group and who were created or organized under the laws of the same country as such controlled foreign corporation. For purposes of clause (v), in determining whether any controlled corporation described in the preceding sentence is a qualified insurance company, all such corporations shall be treated as 1 corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Certain deficits of member of the same chain of corporations may be taken into account</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A controlled foreign corporation may elect to reduce the amount of its subpart F income for any taxable year which is attributable to any qualified activity by the amount of any deficit in earnings and profits of a qualified chain member for a taxable year ending with (or within) the taxable year of such controlled foreign corporation to the extent such deficit is attributable to such activity. To the extent any deficit reduces subpart F income under the preceding sentence, such deficit shall not be taken into account under subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Qualified chain member</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;qualified chain member&rdquo; means, with respect to any controlled foreign corporation, any other corporation which is created or organized under the laws of the same foreign country as the controlled foreign corporation but only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) all the stock of such other corporation (other than directors&rsquo; qualifying shares) is owned at all times during the taxable year in which the deficit arose (directly or through 1 or more corporations other than the common parent) by such controlled foreign corporation, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) all the stock of such controlled foreign corporation (other than directors&rsquo; qualifying shares) is owned at all times during the taxable year in which the deficit arose (directly or through 1 or more corporations other than the common parent) by such other corporation.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Coordination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">This subparagraph shall be applied after subparagraphs (A) and (B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Recharacterization in subsequent taxable years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the subpart F income of any controlled foreign corporation for any taxable year was reduced by reason of paragraph (1)(A), any excess of the earnings and profits of such corporation for any subsequent taxable year over the subpart F income of such foreign corporation for such taxable year shall be recharacterized as subpart F income under rules similar to the rules applicable under section 904(f)(5).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule for determining earnings and profits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, earnings and profits of any controlled foreign corporation shall be determined without regard to paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of section 312(n). Under regulations, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent it would increase earnings and profits by an amount which was previously distributed by the controlled foreign corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Income derived from foreign country</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of subsection (a)(5), including regulations which treat income paid through 1 or more entities as derived from a foreign country to which section 901(j) applies if such income was, without regard to such entities, derived from such country.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subpart, a United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation may, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, elect to make the determinations under subsection (a)(2) of this section and under subsection (g) of section 954 as of the close of the years following the years referred to in such subsections, or as of the close of such longer period of time as such regulations may permit, in lieu of on the last day of such years.

In the case of a United States shareholder who has made an election under section 962 for the taxable year, the increase in basis provided by this subsection shall not exceed an amount equal to the amount of tax paid under this chapter with respect to the amounts required to be included in his gross income under section 951(a).</p>

In the case of a United States shareholder who has made an election under section 962 for any prior taxable year, the reduction in basis provided by this paragraph shall not exceed an amount equal to the amount received which is excluded from gross income under section 959(a) after the application of section 962(d).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, in the case of a United States shareholder who is an individual and who elects to have the provisions of this section apply for the taxable year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the tax imposed under this chapter on amounts which are included in his gross income under section 951(a) shall (in lieu of the tax determined under sections 1 and 55) be an amount equal to the tax which would be imposed under sections 11 and 55 if such amounts were received by a domestic corporation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for purposes of applying the provisions of section 960 (relating to foreign tax credit) such amounts shall be treated as if they were received by a domestic corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An election to have the provisions of this section apply for any taxable year shall be made by a United States shareholder at such time and in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe by regulations. An election made for any taxable year may not be revoked except with the consent of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Pro ration of each section 11 bracket amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of applying subsection (a)(1), the amount in each taxable income bracket in the tax table in section 11(b) shall not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to such bracket amount as the amount included in the gross income of the United States shareholder under section 951(a) for the taxable year bears to such shareholder's pro rata share of the earnings and profits for the taxable year of all controlled foreign corporations with respect to which such shareholder includes any amount in gross income under section 951(a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rule for actual distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The earnings and profits of a foreign corporation attributable to amounts which were included in the gross income of a United States shareholder under section 951(a) and with respect to which an election under this section applied shall, when such earnings and profits are distributed, notwithstanding the provisions of section 959(a)(1), be included in gross income to the extent that such earnings and profits so distributed exceed the amount of tax paid under this chapter on the amounts to which such election applied.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in section 312(k)(4), for purposes of this subpart, the earnings and profits of any foreign corporation, and the deficit in earnings and profits of any foreign corporation, for any taxable year shall be determined according to rules substantially similar to those applicable to domestic corporations, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. In determining such earnings and profits, or the deficit in such earnings and profits, the amount of any illegal bribe, kickback, or other payment (within the meaning of section 162(c)) shall not be taken into account to decrease such earnings and profits or to increase such deficit. The payments referred to in the preceding sentence are payments which would be unlawful under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 if the payor were a United States person.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Blocked foreign income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, no part of the earnings and profits of a controlled foreign corporation for any taxable year shall be included in earnings and profits for purposes of sections 952, 955, and 956, if it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such part could not have been distributed by the controlled foreign corporation to United States shareholders who own (within the meaning of section 958(a)) stock of such controlled foreign corporation because of currency or other restrictions or limitations imposed under the laws of any foreign country.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Records and accounts of United States shareholders</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Two or more persons required to maintain or furnish the same records and accounts with respect to the same foreign corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where, but for this paragraph, two or more United States persons would be required to maintain or furnish the same records and accounts as may by regulations be required under paragraph (1) with respect to the same controlled foreign corporation for the same period, the Secretary may by regulations provide that the maintenance or furnishing of such records and accounts by only one such person shall satisfy the requirements of paragraph (1) for such other persons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Treatment of certain branches</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a qualified insurance branch of a controlled foreign corporation shall be treated as a separate foreign corporation created under the laws of the foreign country with respect to which such branch qualifies under paragraph (2), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) except as provided in regulations, any amount directly or indirectly transferred or credited from such branch to one or more other accounts of such controlled foreign corporation shall be treated as a dividend paid to such controlled foreign corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Qualified insurance branch</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;qualified insurance branch&rdquo; means any branch of a controlled foreign corporation which is licensed and predominantly engaged on a permanent basis in the active conduct of an insurance business in a foreign country if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) separate books and accounts are maintained for such branch,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the principal place of business of such branch is in such foreign country,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) an election under this paragraph applies to such branch.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">An election under this paragraph shall apply to the taxable year for which made and all subsequent taxable years unless revoked with the consent of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Gain on certain stock sales by controlled foreign corporations treated as dividends</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a controlled foreign corporation sells or exchanges stock in any other foreign corporation, gain recognized on such sale or exchange shall be included in the gross income of such controlled foreign corporation as a dividend to the same extent that it would have been so included under section 1248(a) if such controlled foreign corporation were a United States person. For purposes of determining the amount which would have been so includible, the determination of whether such other foreign corporation was a controlled foreign corporation shall be made without regard to the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Same country exception not applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Clause (i) of section 954(c)(3)(A) shall not apply to any amount treated as a dividend by reason of paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Clarification of deemed sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, a controlled foreign corporation shall be treated as having sold or exchanged any stock if, under any provision of this subtitle, such controlled foreign corporation is treated as having gain from the sale or exchange of such stock.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Export trade income constituting foreign base company income</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957) which for the taxable year is an export trade corporation, the subpart F income (determined without regard to this subpart) of such corporation for such year shall be reduced by an amount equal to so much of the export trade income (as defined in section 971(b)) of such corporation for such year as constitutes foreign base company income (as defined in section 954), but only to the extent that such amount does not exceed whichever of the following amounts is the lesser:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an amount equal to 11/2 times so much of the export promotion expenses (as defined in section 971(d)) of such corporation for such year as is probably allocable to the export trade income which constitutes foreign base company income of such corporation for such year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an amount equal to 10 percent of so much of the gross receipts for such year (or, in the case of gross receipts arising from commissions, fees, or other compensation for its services, so much of the gross amount upon the basis of which such commissions, fees, or other compensation is computed) accruing to such export trade corporation from the sale, installation, operation, maintenance, or use of property in respect of which such corporation derives export trade income as is properly allocable to the export trade income which constitutes foreign base company income of such corporation for such year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The allocations with respect to export trade income which constitutes foreign base company income under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Overall limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The reduction under paragraph (1) for any taxable year shall not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to the increase in the investments in export trade assets (as defined in section 971(c)) of such corporation for such year as the export trade income which <!-- PDFPage:1608 -->constitutes foreign base company income of such corporation for such year bears to the entire export trade income of such corporation for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inclusion of certain previously excluded amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation which for any prior taxable year was an export trade corporation shall include in his gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A)(ii), as an amount to which section 955 (relating to withdrawal of previously excluded subpart F income from qualified investment) applies, his pro rata share of the amount of decrease in the investments in export trade assets of such corporation for such year, but only to the extent that his pro rata share of such amount does not exceed an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) his pro rata share of the sum of (A) the amounts by which the subpart F income of such corporation was reduced for all prior taxable years under subsection (a), and (B) the amounts not included in subpart F income (determined without regard to this subpart) for all prior taxable years by reason of the treatment (under section 972 as in effect before the date of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1976) of two or more controlled foreign corporations which are export trade corporations as a single controlled foreign corporation, reduced by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the sum of the amounts which were included in his gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A)(ii) under the provisions of this subsection for all prior taxable years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Investments in export trade assets</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amount of investments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the amount taken into account with respect to any export trade asset shall be its adjusted basis, reduced by any liability to which the asset is subject.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Increase in investments in export trade assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (a), the amount of increase in investments in export trade assets of any controlled foreign corporation for any taxable year is the amount by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of such investments at the close of the taxable year, exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of such investments at the close of the preceding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Decrease in investments in export trade assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (b), the amount of decrease in investments in export trade assets of any controlled foreign corporation for any taxable year is the amount by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of such investments at the close of the preceding taxable year (reduced by an amount equal to the amount of net loss sustained during the taxable year with respect to export trade assets), exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of such investments at the close of the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A United States shareholder of an export trade corporation may, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, make the determinations under paragraphs (2) and (3) as of the close of the 75th day after the close of the years referred to in such paragraphs in lieu of on the last day of such years. A United States shareholder of an export trade corporation may, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, make the determinations under paragraphs (2) and (3) with respect to export trade assets described in section 971(c)(3) as of the close of the years following the years referred to in such paragraphs, or as of the close of such longer period of time as such regulations may permit, in lieu of on the last day of such years and in lieu of on the day prescribed in the preceding sentence. Any election under this paragraph made with respect to any taxable year shall apply to such year and to all succeeding taxable years unless the Secretary consents to the revocation of such election.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If the taxpayer fails to substantially comply with any formal document request arising out of the examination of the tax treatment of any item (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;examined item&rdquo;) before the 90th day after the date of the mailing of such request on motion by the Secretary, any court having jurisdiction of a civil proceeding in which the tax treatment of the examined item is an issue shall prohibit the introduction by the taxpayer of any foreign-based documentation covered by such request.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Foreign nondisclosure law not reasonable cause</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the fact that a foreign jurisdiction would impose a civil or criminal penalty on the taxpayer (or any other person) for disclosing the requested documentation is not reasonable cause.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Formal document request</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Formal document request</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;formal document request&rdquo; means any request (made after the normal request procedures have failed to produce the requested documentation) for the production of foreign-based documentation which is mailed by registered or certified mail to the taxpayer at his last known address and which sets forth&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other law or rule of law, any person to whom a formal document request is mailed shall have the right to begin a proceeding to quash such request not later than the 90th day after the day such request was mailed. In any such proceeding, the Secretary may seek to compel compliance with such request.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The United States district court for the district in which the person (to whom the formal document request is mailed) resides or is found shall have jurisdiction to hear any proceeding brought under subparagraph (A). An order denying the petition shall be deemed a final order which may be appealed.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Suspension of 90-day period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The running of the 90-day period referred to in subsection (a) shall be suspended during any period during which a proceeding brought under subparagraph (A) is pending.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Foreign-based documentation</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;996. Rules for allocation in the case of distributions and losses</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Rules for actual distributions and certain deemed distributions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any actual distribution (other than a distribution described in paragraph (2) or to which section 995(c) applies) to a shareholder by a DISC (or former DISC) which is made out of earnings and profits shall be treated as made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) first, out of previously taxed income, to the extent thereof,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) second, out of accumulated DISC income, to the extent thereof, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) finally, out of other earnings and profits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Qualifying distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any actual distribution made pursuant to section 992(c) (relating to distributions to meet qualification requirements), and any deemed distribution pursuant to section 995(b)(1)(G) (relating to foreign investment attributable to producer's loans), shall be treated as made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) first, out of accumulated DISC income, to the extent thereof,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) second, out of the earnings and profits described in paragraph (1)(C), to the extent thereof, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) finally, out of previously taxed income.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In the case of any amount of any actual distribution to a C corporation made pursuant to section 992(c) which is required to satisfy the <!-- PDFPage:1632 -->condition of section 992(a)(1)(A), the preceding sentence shall apply to 16/17ths of such amount and paragraph (1) shall apply to the remaining 1/17th of such amount.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exclusion from gross income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts distributed out of previously taxed income shall be excluded by the distributee from gross income except for gains described in subsection (e)(2), and shall reduce the amount of the previously taxed income.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Ordering rules for losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If for any taxable year a DISC, or a former DISC, incurs a deficit in earnings and profits, such deficit shall be chargeable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) first, to earnings and profits described in subsection (a)(1)(C), to the extent thereof,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) second, to accumulated DISC income, to the extent thereof, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) finally, to previously taxed income, except that a deficit in earnings and profits shall not be applied against accumulated DISC income which has been determined is to be deemed distributed to the shareholders (pursuant to section 995(b)(2)(A)) as a result of a revocation of election or other disqualification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Priority of distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any actual distribution made during a taxable year shall be treated as being made subsequent to any deemed distribution made during such year. Any actual distribution made pursuant to section 992(c) (relating to distributions to meet qualification requirements) shall be treated as being made before any other actual distributions during the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Subsequent effect of previous disposition of DISC stock</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Shareholder previously taxed income adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) gain with respect to a share of stock of a DISC or former DISC is treated under section 995(c) as a dividend or as ordinary income, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any person subsequently receives an actual distribution made out of accumulated DISC income, or a deemed distribution made pursuant to section 995(b)(2), with respect to such share,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">such person shall treat such distribution in the same manner as a distribution from previously taxed income to the extent that (i) the gain referred to in subparagraph (A), exceeds (ii) any other amounts with respect to such share which were treated under this paragraph as made from previously taxed income. In applying this paragraph with respect to a share of stock in a DISC or former DISC, gain on the acquisition of such share by the DISC or former DISC or gain on a transaction prior to such acquisition shall not be considered gain referred to in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Corporate adjustment upon redemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If section 995(c) applies to a redemption of stock in a DISC or former DISC, the accumulated DISC income shall be reduced by an amount equal to the gain described in section 995(c) with respect to such stock which is (or has been) treated as ordinary income, except to the extent distributions with respect to such stock have been treated under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Adjustment to basis</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Additions to basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts representing deemed distributions as provided in section 995(b) shall increase the basis of the stock with respect to which the distribution is made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reductions of basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The portion of an actual distribution made out of previously taxed income shall reduce the basis of the stock with respect to which it is made, and to the extent that it exceeds the adjusted basis of such stock, shall be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property. In the case of stock includible in the gross estate of a decedent for which an election is made under section 2032 (relating to alternate valuation), this paragraph shall not apply to any distribution made after the date of the decedent's death and before the alternate valuation date provided by section 2032.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definition of divisions of earnings and profits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) DISC income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The earnings and profits derived by a corporation during a taxable year in which such corporation is a DISC, before reduction for any distributions during the year, but reduced by amounts deemed distributed under section 995(b)(1), shall constitute the DISC income for such year. The earnings and profits of a DISC for a taxable year include any amounts includible in such DISC's gross income pursuant to section 951(a) for such year. Accumulated DISC income shall be reduced by deemed distributions under section 995(b)(2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Previously taxed income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Earnings and profits deemed distributed under section 995(b) for a taxable year shall constitute previously taxed income for such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Other earnings and profits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The earnings and profits for a taxable year which are described in neither paragraph (1) nor (2) shall constitute the other earnings and profits for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Effectively connected income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a shareholder who is a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation, trust, or estate, gains referred to in section 995(c) and all distributions out of accumulated DISC income including deemed distributions shall be treated as gains and distributions which are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business conducted through a permanent establishment of such shareholder within the United States and which are derived from sources within the United States.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">that person or shareholder (within the meaning of section 951(b)) shall report such operations to the Secretary at such time and in such manner as the Secretary prescribes, except that in the case of a foreign corporation such report shall be required only of a United States shareholder (within the meaning of such section) of such corporation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the person or a member of a controlled group (within the meaning of section 993(a)(3)) which includes the person participates in or cooperates with an international boycott in the taxable year, all operations of the taxpayer or such group in that country and in any other country which requires participation in or cooperation with the boycott as a condition of doing business within that country, or with the government, a company, or a national of that country, shall be treated as operations in connection with which such participation or cooperation occurred, except to the extent that the person can clearly demonstrate that a particular operation is a clearly separate and identifiable operation in connection with which there was no participation in or cooperation with an international boycott.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A clearly separate and identifiable operation of a person, or of a member of the controlled group (within the meaning of section 993(a)(3)) which includes that person, in or related to any country within the group of countries referred to in paragraph (1) shall not be treated as an operation in or related to a group of countries associated in carrying out an international boycott if the person can clearly demonstrate that he, or that such member, did not participate in or cooperate with the international boycott in connection with that operation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Separate and identifiable operations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A taxpayer may show that different operations within the same country, or operations in different countries, are clearly separate and identifiable operations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Definition of boycott participation and cooperation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, a person participates in or cooperates with an international boycott if he agrees&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) as a condition of doing business directly or indirectly within a country or with the government, a company, or a national of a country&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to refrain from doing business with any company whose ownership or management is made up, all or in part, of individuals of a particular nationality, race, or religion, or to remove (or refrain from selecting) corporate directors who are individuals of a particular nationality, race, or religion; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">This section shall not apply to any agreement by a person (or such member)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to comply with a prohibition on the importation of goods produced in whole or in part in any country which is the object of an international boycott, or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) International boycott factor</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) International boycott factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of sections 908(a), 952(a)(3), and 995(b)(1)(F)(ii), the international boycott factor is a fraction, determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the numerator of which reflects the world-wide operations of a person (or, in the case of a controlled group (within the meaning of section 993(a)(3)) which includes that person, of the group) which are operations in or related to a group of countries associated in carrying out an international boycott in or with which that person or a member of that controlled group has participated or cooperated in the taxable year, and the denominator of which reflects the world-wide operations of that person or group.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Specifically attributable taxes and income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the taxpayer clearly demonstrates that the foreign taxes paid and income earned for the taxable year are attributable to specific operations, then, in lieu of applying the international boycott factor for such taxable year, the amount of the credit disallowed under section 908(a), the addition to subpart F income under section 952(a)(3), and the amount of deemed distribution under section 995(b)(1)(F)(ii) for the taxable year, if any, shall be the amount specifically attributable to the operations in which there was participation in or cooperation with an international boycott under section 999(b)(1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) World-wide operations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;world-wide operations&rdquo; means operations in <!-- PDFPage:1635 -->or related to countries other than the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination with respect to particular operations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon a request made by the taxpayer, the Secretary shall issue a determination with respect to whether a particular operation of a person, or of a member of a controlled group which includes that person, constitutes participation in or cooperation with an international boycott. The Secretary may issue such a determination in advance of such operation in cases which are of such a nature that an advance determination is possible and appropriate under the circumstances. If the request is made before the operation is commenced, or before the end of a taxable year in which the operation is carried out, the Secretary may decline to issue such a determination before close of the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Participation or cooperation by related persons</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a person controls (within the meaning of section 304(c)) a corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) participation in or cooperation with an international boycott by such corporation shall be presumed to be such participation or cooperation by such person, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) participation in or cooperation with such a boycott by such person shall be presumed to be such participation or cooperation by such corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Willful failure to report</h4>
