<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) except as provided in subsection (b), no summons may be issued under this title, and the Secretary may not begin any action under section 7604 to enforce any summons to produce or analyze any tax-related computer software source code; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any software and related materials which are provided to the Secretary under this title shall be subject to the safeguards under subsection (c).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Circumstances under which computer software source code may be provided</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (a)(1) shall not apply to any portion, item, or component of tax-related computer software source code if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary is unable to otherwise reasonably ascertain the correctness of any item on a return from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the taxpayer's books, papers, records, or other data; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the computer software executable code (and any modifications thereof) to which such source code relates and any associated data which, when executed, produces the output to ascertain the correctness of the item;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary identifies with reasonable specificity the portion, item, or component of such source code needed to verify the correctness of such item on the return; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Secretary determines that the need for the portion, item, or component of such source code with respect to such item outweighs the risks of unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (a)(1) shall not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any inquiry into any offense connected with the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any tax-related computer software source code acquired or developed by the taxpayer or a related person primarily for internal use by the taxpayer or such person rather than for commercial distribution;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any tax-related computer software source code which is required to be provided or made available pursuant to any other provision of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Cooperation required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall be treated as meeting the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of such paragraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary determines that it is not feasible to determine the correctness of an item without access to the computer software executable code and associated data described in paragraph (1)(A)(ii);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary makes a formal request to the taxpayer for such code and data and to the owner of the computer software source code for such executable code; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3198 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such code and data is not provided within 180 days of such request.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Right to contest summons</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any proceeding brought under section 7604 to enforce a summons issued under the authority of this subsection, the court shall, at the request of any party, hold a hearing to determine whether the applicable requirements of this subsection have been met.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Entry of protective order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any court proceeding to enforce a summons for any portion of software, the court may receive evidence and issue any order necessary to prevent the disclosure of trade secrets or other confidential information with respect to such software, including requiring that any information be placed under seal to be opened only as directed by the court.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Protection of software</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the software may be used only in connection with the examination of such taxpayer's return, any appeal by the taxpayer to the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals, any judicial proceeding (and any appeals therefrom), and any inquiry into any offense connected with the administration or enforcement of the internal revenue laws;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary shall provide, in advance, to the taxpayer and the owner of the software a written list of the names of all individuals who will analyze or otherwise have access to the software;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the software shall be maintained in a secure area or place, and, in the case of computer software source code, shall not be removed from the owner's place of business unless the owner permits, or a court orders, such removal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the software may not be copied except as necessary to perform such analysis, and the Secretary shall number all copies made and certify in writing that no other copies have been (or will be) made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) at the end of the period during which the software may be used under subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the software and all copies thereof shall be returned to the person from whom they were obtained and any copies thereof made under subparagraph (D) on the hard drive of a machine or other mass storage device shall be permanently deleted; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) participate for 2 years in the development of software which is intended for a similar purpose as the software examined; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) the software shall be treated as return information for purposes of section 6103.</p>
