This paragraph shall not apply with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any amounts payable under the terms of such trust to income beneficiaries, unless a deduction was allowed under section 170(f)(2)(B), 2055(e)(2)(B), or 2522(c)(2)(B),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any amounts in trust other than amounts for which a deduction was allowed under section 170, 545(b)(2), 642(c), 2055, 2106(a)(2), or 2522, if such other amounts are segregated from amounts for which no deduction was allowable, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any amounts transferred in trust before May 27, 1969.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Segregated amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (2)(B), a trust with respect to which amounts are segregated shall separately account for the various income, deduction, and other items properly attributable to each of such segregated amounts.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any amounts in the trust are segregated within the meaning of subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section, the value of the net assets for purposes of subsections (c)(2) and (g) of section 507 shall be limited to such segregated amounts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Sections 4943 and 4944</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Sections 4943 and 4944 shall not apply to a trust which is described in subsection (a)(2) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) all the income interest (and none of the remainder interest) of such trust is devoted solely to one or more of the purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B), and all amounts in such trust for which a deduction was allowed under section 170, 545(b)(2), 642(c), 2055, 2106(a)(2), or 2522 have an aggregate value not more than 60 percent of the aggregate fair market value of all amounts in such trusts, or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2539 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a deduction was allowed under section 170, 545(b)(2), 642(c), 2055, 2106(a)(2), or 2522 for amounts payable under the terms of such trust to every remainder beneficiary but not to any income beneficiary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Section 507</h4>
