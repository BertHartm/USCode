<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6331. Levy and distraint</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the same within 10 days after notice and demand, it shall be lawful for the Secretary to collect such tax (and such further sum as shall be sufficient to cover the expenses of the levy) by levy upon all property and rights to property (except such property as is exempt under section 6334) belonging to such person or on which there is a lien provided in this chapter for the payment of such tax. Levy may be made upon the accrued salary or wages of any officer, employee, or elected official, of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States or the District of Columbia, by serving a notice of levy on the employer (as defined in section 3401(d)) of such officer, employee, or elected official. If the Secretary makes a finding that the collection of such tax is in jeopardy, notice and demand for immediate payment of such tax may be made by the Secretary and, upon failure or refusal to pay such tax, collection thereof by levy shall be lawful without regard to the 10-day period provided in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Seizure and sale of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;levy&rdquo; as used in this title includes the power of distraint and seizure by any means. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a levy shall extend only to property possessed and obligations existing at the time thereof. In any case in which the Secretary may levy upon property or rights to property, he may seize and sell such property or rights to property (whether real or personal, tangible or intangible).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Successive seizures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any property or right to property upon which levy has been made by virtue of subsection (a) is not sufficient to satisfy the claim of the United States for which levy is made, the Secretary may, thereafter, and as often as may be necessary, proceed to levy in like manner upon any other property liable to levy of the person against whom such claim exists, until the amount due from him, together with all expenses, is fully paid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Requirement of notice before levy</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Levy may be made under subsection (a) upon the salary or wages or other property of any person with respect to any unpaid tax only after the Secretary has notified such person in writing of his intention to make such levy.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) 30-day requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The notice required under paragraph (1) shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) given in person,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) left at the dwelling or usual place of business of such person, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) sent by certified or registered mail to such persons's last known address,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">no less than 30 days before the day of the levy.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Jeopardy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a levy if the Secretary has made a finding under the last sentence of subsection (a) that the collection of tax is in jeopardy.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Information included with notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The notice required under paragraph (1) shall include a brief statement which sets forth in simple and nontechnical terms&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the provisions of this title relating to levy and sale of property,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the procedures applicable to the levy and sale of property under this title,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the administrative appeals available to the taxpayer with respect to such levy and sale and the procedures relating to such appeals,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the alternatives available to taxpayers which could prevent levy on the property <!-- PDFPage:2709 -->(including installment agreements under section 6159),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the provisions of this title relating to redemption of property and release of liens on property, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the procedures applicable to the redemption of property and the release of a lien on property under this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Continuing levy on salary and wages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The effect of a levy on salary or wages payable to or received by a taxpayer shall be continuous from the date such levy is first made until such levy is released under section 6343.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Uneconomical levy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No levy may be made on any property if the amount of the expenses which the Secretary estimates (at the time of levy) would be incurred by the Secretary with respect to the levy and sale of such property exceeds the fair market value of such property at the time of levy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Levy on appearance date of summons</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No levy may be made on the property of any person on any day on which such person (or officer or employee of such person) is required to appear in response to a summons issued by the Secretary for the purpose of collecting any underpayment of tax.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) No application in case of jeopardy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply if the Secretary finds that the collection of tax is in jeopardy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Continuing levy on certain payments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The effect of a levy on specified payments to or received by a taxpayer shall be continuous from the date such levy is first made until such levy is released. Notwithstanding section 6334, such continuous levy shall attach to up to 15 percent of any specified payment due to the taxpayer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Specified payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;specified payment&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any Federal payment other than a payment for which eligibility is based on the income or assets (or both) of a payee,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any payment described in paragraph (4), (7), (9), or (11) of section 6334(a), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any annuity or pension payment under the Railroad Retirement Act or benefit under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Cross references</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6335. Sale of seized property</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Notice of seizure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As soon as practicable after seizure of property, notice in writing shall be given by the Secretary to the owner of the property (or, in the case of personal property, the possessor thereof), or shall be left at his usual place of abode or business if he has such within the internal revenue district where the seizure is made. If the owner cannot be readily located, or has no dwelling or place of business within such district, the notice may be mailed to his last known address. Such notice shall specify the sum demanded and shall contain, in the case of personal property, an account of the property seized and, in the case of real property, a description with reasonable certainty of the property seized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notice of sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall as soon as practicable after the seizure of the property give notice to the owner, in the manner prescribed in subsection (a), and shall cause a notification to be published in some newspaper published or generally circulated within the county wherein such seizure is made, or if there be no newspaper published or generally circulated in such county, shall post such notice at the post office nearest the place where the seizure is made, and in not less than two other public places. Such notice shall specify the property to be sold, and the time, place, manner, and conditions of the sale thereof. Whenever levy is made without regard to the 10-day period provided in section 6331(a), public notice of sale of the property seized shall not be made within such 10-day period unless section 6336 (relating to sale of perishable goods) is applicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Sale of indivisible property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any property liable to levy is not divisible, so as to enable the Secretary by sale of a part thereof to raise the whole amount of the tax and expenses, the whole of such property shall be sold.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Time and place of sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The time of sale shall not be less than 10 days nor more than 40 days from the time of giving public notice under subsection (b). The place of sale shall be within the county in which the property is seized, except by special order of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Manner and conditions of sale</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Determinations relating to minimum price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before the sale of property seized by levy, the Secretary shall determine&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a minimum price for which such property shall be sold (taking into account the expense of making the levy and conducting the sale), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) whether, on the basis of criteria prescribed by the Secretary, the purchase of such property by the United States at such minimum price would be in the best interest of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Sale to highest bidder at or above minimum price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, at the sale, one or more persons offer to purchase such property for not less than the amount of the minimum price, the property shall be declared sold to the highest bidder.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Property deemed sold to United States at minimum price in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If no person offers the amount of the minimum price for such property at the sale and the Secretary has determined that the purchase of such property by the United States would be in the best interest of the United States, the property shall be declared to be sold to the United States at such minimum price.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Release to owner in other cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, at the sale, the property is not declared sold under subparagraph (B) or (C), the property shall be released to the owner thereof and the expense of the levy and sale shall be added to the amount of tax for the collection of which the levy was made. Any property released under this subparagraph shall remain subject to any lien imposed by subchapter C.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional rules applicable to sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall by regulations prescribe the manner and other conditions of the sale of property seized by levy. If one or more alternative methods or conditions are permitted by regulations, the Secretary shall select the alternatives applicable to the sale. Such regulations shall provide:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) That the sale shall not be conducted in any manner other than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) by public auction, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by public sale under sealed bids.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) In the case of the seizure of several items of property, whether such items shall be offered separately, in groups, or in the aggregate; and whether such property shall be offered both separately (or in groups) and in the aggregate, and sold under whichever method produces the highest aggregate amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Whether the announcement of the minimum price determined by the Secretary <!-- PDFPage:2716 -->may be delayed until the receipt of the highest bid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Whether payment in full shall be required at the time of acceptance of a bid, or whether a part of such payment may be deferred for such period (not to exceed 1 month) as may be determined by the Secretary to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The extent to which methods (including advertising) in addition to those prescribed in subsection (b) may be used in giving notice of the sale.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Under what circumstances the Secretary may adjourn the sale from time to time (but such adjournments shall not be for a period to exceed in all 1 month).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Payment of amount bid</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If payment in full is required at the time of acceptance of a bid and is not then and there paid, the Secretary shall forthwith proceed to again sell the property in the manner provided in this subsection. If the conditions of the sale permit part of the payment to be deferred, and if such part is not paid within the prescribed period, suit may be instituted against the purchaser for the purchase price or such part thereof as has not been paid, together with interest at the rate of 6 percent per annum from the date of the sale; or, in the discretion of the Secretary, the sale may be declared by the Secretary to be null and void for failure to make full payment of the purchase price and the property may again be advertised and sold as provided in subsections (b) and (c) and this subsection. In the event of such readvertisement and sale any new purchaser shall receive such property or rights to property, free and clear of any claim or right of the former defaulting purchaser, of any nature whatsoever, and the amount paid upon the bid price by such defaulting purchaser shall be forfeited.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Right to request sale of seized property within 60 days</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The owner of any property seized by levy may request that the Secretary sell such property within 60 days after such request (or within such longer period as may be specified by the owner). The Secretary shall comply with such request unless the Secretary determines (and notifies the owner within such period) that such compliance would not be in the best interests of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Stay of sale of seized property pending Tax Court decision</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>For restrictions on sale of seized property pending Tax Court decision, see section 6863(b)(3).</strong></p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Release of levy and notice of release</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the Secretary shall release the levy upon all, or part of, the property or rights to property levied upon and shall promptly notify the person upon whom such levy was made (if any) that such levy has been released if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the liability for which such levy was made is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) release of such levy will facilitate the collection of such liability,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the taxpayer has entered into an agreement under section 6159 to satisfy such liability by means of installment payments, unless such agreement provides otherwise,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the Secretary has determined that such levy is creating an economic hardship due to the financial condition of the taxpayer, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the fair market value of the property exceeds such liability and release of the levy on a part of such property could be made without hindering the collection of such liability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (C), the Secretary is not required to release such levy if such release would jeopardize the secured creditor status of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Expedited determination on certain business property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any tangible personal property essential in carrying on the trade or business of the taxpayer, the Secretary shall provide for an expedited determination under paragraph (1) if levy on such tangible personal property would prevent the taxpayer from carrying on such trade or business.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Subsequent levy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The release of levy on any property under paragraph (1) shall not prevent any subsequent levy on such property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Return of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary determines that property has been wrongfully levied upon, it shall be lawful for the Secretary to return&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the specific property levied upon,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an amount of money equal to the amount of money levied upon, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an amount of money equal to the amount of money received by the United States from a sale of such property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Property may be returned at any time. An amount equal to the amount of money levied upon or received from such sale may be returned <!-- PDFPage:2720 -->at any time before the expiration of 9 months from the date of such levy. For purposes of paragraph (3), if property is declared purchased by the United States at a sale pursuant to section 6335(e) (relating to manner and conditions of sale), the United States shall be treated as having received an amount of money equal to the minimum price determined pursuant to such section or (if larger) the amount received by the United States from the resale of such property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Interest shall be allowed and paid at the overpayment rate established under section 6621&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in a case described in subsection (b)(2), from the date the Secretary receives the money to a date (to be determined by the Secretary) preceding the date of return by not more than 30 days, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in a case described in subsection (b)(3), from the date of the sale of the property to a date (to be determined by the Secretary) preceding the date of return by not more than 30 days.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Return of property in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any property has been levied upon, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the levy on such property was premature or otherwise not in accordance with administrative procedures of the Secretary,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the taxpayer has entered into an agreement under section 6159 to satisfy the tax liability for which the levy was imposed by means of installment payments, unless such agreement provides otherwise,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the return of such property will facilitate the collection of the tax liability, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) with the consent of the taxpayer or the Taxpayer Advocate, the return of such property would be in the best interests of the taxpayer (as determined by the Taxpayer Advocate) and the United States,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the provisions of subsection (b) shall apply in the same manner as if such property had been wrongly levied upon, except that no interest shall be allowed under subsection (c).</p>
