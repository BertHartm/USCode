<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) out of its earnings and profits of the taxable year (computed as of the close of the taxable year without diminution by reason of any distributions made during the taxable year), without regard to the amount of the earnings and profits at the time the distribution was made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Except as otherwise provided in this subtitle, every distribution is made out of earnings and profits to the extent thereof, and from the most recently accumulated earnings and profits.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Certain insurance company dividends</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the term &ldquo;dividend&rdquo; also means any distribution of property (whether or not a dividend as defined in subsection (a)) made by the corporation to its shareholders, to the extent of its undistributed personal holding company income (determined under section 545 without regard to distributions under this paragraph) for such year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;distribution of property&rdquo; includes a distribution in complete liquidation occurring within 24 months after the adoption of a plan of liquidation, but&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) only to the extent of the amounts distributed to distributees other than corporate shareholders, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) only to the extent that the corporation designates such amounts as a dividend distribution and duly notifies such distributees of such designation, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, but</p>
