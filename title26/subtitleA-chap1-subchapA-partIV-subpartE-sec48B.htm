<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Qualifying gasification project</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;qualifying gasification project&rdquo; means any project which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) employs gasification technology,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) will be carried out by an eligible entity, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;gasification technology&rdquo; means any process which converts a solid or liquid product from coal, petroleum residue, biomass, or other materials which are recovered for their energy or feedstock value into a synthesis gas composed primarily of carbon monoxide and hydrogen for direct use or subsequent chemical or physical conversion.</p>
