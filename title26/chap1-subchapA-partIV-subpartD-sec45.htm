<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Credit and phaseout adjustment based on inflation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The 1.5 cent amount in subsection (a) and the 8 cent amount in paragraph (1) shall each be adjusted by multiplying such amount by the inflation adjustment factor for the calendar year in which the sale occurs.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Credit reduced for grants, tax-exempt bonds, subsidized energy financing, and other credits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the credit determined under subsection (a) with respect to any project for any taxable year (determined after the application of paragraphs (1) and (2)) shall be reduced by the amount which is the product of the amount so determined for such year and a fraction&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the aggregate amount of subsidized energy financing provided (directly or indirectly) under a Federal, State, or local program provided in connection with the project, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the amount of any other credit allowable with respect to any property which is part of the project, and</p>
