<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to receive</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be lawful for the Secretary to receive for internal revenue taxes (or in payment for internal revenue stamps) any commercially acceptable means that the Secretary deems appropriate to the extent and under the conditions provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Ultimate liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a check, money order, or other method of payment, including payment by credit card, debit card, or charge card so received is not duly paid, or is paid and subsequently charged back to the Secretary, the person by whom such check, or money order, or other method of payment has been tendered shall remain liable for the payment of the tax or for the stamps, and for all legal penalties and additions, to the same extent as if such check, money order, or other method of payment had not been tendered.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Liability of banks and others</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any certified, treasurer's, or cashier's check (or other guaranteed draft), or any money order, or any other means of payment that has been guaranteed by a financial institution (such as a <!-- PDFPage:3084 -->credit card, debit card, or charge card transaction which has been guaranteed expressly by a financial institution) so received is not duly paid, the United States shall, in addition to its right to exact payment from the party originally indebted therefor, have a lien for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount of such check (or draft) upon all assets of the financial institution on which drawn,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of such money order upon all the assets of the issuer thereof, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the guaranteed amount of any other transaction upon all the assets of the institution making such guarantee,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">and such amount shall be paid out of such assets in preference to any other claims whatsoever against such financial institution, issuer, or guaranteeing institution, except the necessary costs and expenses of administration and the reimbursement of the United States for the amount expended in the redemption of the circulating notes of such financial institution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payment by other means</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority to prescribe regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as the Secretary deems necessary to receive payment by commercially acceptable means, including regulations that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) specify which methods of payment by commercially acceptable means will be acceptable,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) specify when payment by such means will be considered received,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) identify types of nontax matters related to payment by such means that are to be resolved by persons ultimately liable for payment and financial intermediaries, without the involvement of the Secretary, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) ensure that tax matters will be resolved by the Secretary, without the involvement of financial intermediaries.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Authority to enter into contracts</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a payment of internal revenue taxes (or a payment for internal revenue stamps) shall not be subject to section 170 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1666i), or to any similar provisions of State law,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a payment of internal revenue taxes (or a payment for internal revenue stamps) by a person by use of a debit card shall not be subject to section 908 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693f), or to any similar provisions of State law, if the error alleged by the person is an error relating to the underlying tax liability, rather than an error relating to the debit card account such as a computational error or numerical transposition in the debit card transaction or an issue as to whether the person authorized payment by use of the debit card,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the term &ldquo;creditor&rdquo; under section 103(f) of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1602(f)) shall not include the Secretary with respect to credit card transactions in payment of internal revenue taxes (or payment for internal revenue stamps), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, in the case of payment made by credit card or debit card transaction of an amount owed to a person as the result of the correction of an error under section 161 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1666) or section 908 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693f), the Secretary is authorized to provide such amount to such person as a credit to that person's credit card or debit card account through the applicable credit card or debit card system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Confidentiality of information</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise authorized by this subsection, no person may use or disclose any information relating to credit or debit card transactions obtained pursuant to section 6103(k)(9) other than for purposes directly related to the processing of such transactions, or the billing or collection of amounts charged or debited pursuant thereto.</p>
