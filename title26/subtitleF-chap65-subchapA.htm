<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Offset of past-due support against overpayments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of any overpayment to be refunded to the person making the overpayment shall be reduced by the amount of any past-due <!-- PDFPage:3318 -->support (as defined in section 464(c) of the Social Security Act) owed by that person of which the Secretary has been notified by a State in accordance with section 464 of of&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6402_2_target" name="6402_2">2</a></sup> such Act.

The Secretary shall apply a reduction under this subsection first to an amount certified by the State as past due support under section 464 of the Social Security Act before any other reductions allowed by law. This subsection shall be applied to an overpayment prior to its being credited to a person's future liability for an internal revenue tax.</p>
