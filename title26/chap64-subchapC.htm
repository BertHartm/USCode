<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Liens for estate tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c)&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Upon gross estate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Unless the estate tax imposed by chapter 11 is sooner paid in full, or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time, it shall be a lien upon the gross estate of the decedent for 10 years from the date of death, except that such part of the gross estate as is used for the payment of charges against the estate and expenses of its administration, allowed by any court having jurisdiction thereof, shall be divested of such lien.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Liability of transferees and others</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the estate tax imposed by chapter 11 is not paid when due, then the spouse, transferee, trustee (except the trustee of an employees&rsquo; trust which meets the requirements of section 401(a)), surviving tenant, person in possession of the property by reason of the exercise, nonexercise, or release of a power of appointment, or beneficiary, who receives, or has on the date of the decedent's death, property included in the gross estate under sections 2034 to 2042, inclusive, to the extent of the value, at the time of the decedent's death, of such property, shall be personally liable for such tax. Any <!-- PDFPage:2578 -->part of such property transferred by (or transferred by a transferee of) such spouse, transferee, trustee, surviving tenant, person in possession, or beneficiary, to a purchaser or holder of a security interest shall be divested of the lien provided in paragraph (1) and a like lien shall then attach to all the property of such spouse, transferee, trustee, surviving tenant, person in possession, or beneficiary, or transferee of any such person, except any part transferred to a purchaser or a holder of a security interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Continuance after discharge of fiduciary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of section 2204 (relating to discharge of fiduciary from personal liability) shall not operate as a release of any part of the gross estate from the lien for any deficiency that may thereafter be determined to be due, unless such part of the gross estate (or any interest therein) has been transferred to a purchaser or a holder of a security interest, in which case such part (or such interest) shall not be subject to a lien or to any claim or demand for any such deficiency, but the lien shall attach to the consideration received from such purchaser or holder of a security interest, by the heirs, legatees, devisees, or distributees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Lien for gift tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), unless the gift tax imposed by chapter 12 is sooner paid in full or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time, such tax shall be a lien upon all gifts made during the period for which the return was filed, for 10 years from the date the gifts are made. If the tax is not paid when due, the donee of any gift shall be personally liable for such tax to the extent of the value of such gift. Any part of the property comprised in the gift transferred by the donee (or by a transferee of the donee) to a purchaser or holder of a security interest shall be divested of the lien imposed by this subsection and such lien, to the extent of the value of such gift, shall attach to all the property (including after-acquired property) of the donee (or the transferee) except any part transferred to a purchaser or holder of a security interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The lien imposed by subsection (a) or (b) shall not be valid as against a mechanic's lienor and, subject to the conditions provided by section 6323(b) (relating to protection for certain interests even though notice filed), shall not be valid with respect to any lien or interest described in section 6323(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a lien imposed by subsection (a) or (b) is not valid as against a lien or security interest, the priority of such lien or security interest shall extend to any item described in section 6323(e) (relating to priority of interest and expenses) to the extent that, under local law, such item has the same priority as the lien or security interest to which it relates.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6324A. Special lien for estate tax deferred under section 6166</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any estate with respect to which an election has been made under section 6166, if the executor makes an election under this section (at such time and in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe) and files the agreement referred to in subsection (c), the deferred amount (plus any interest, additional amount, addition to tax, assessable penalty, and costs attributable to the deferred amount) shall be a lien in favor of the United States on the section 6166 lien property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Section 6166 lien property</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;section 6166 lien property&rdquo; means interests in real and other property to the extent such interests&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) can be expected to survive the deferral period, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) are designated in the agreement referred to in subsection (c).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Maximum value of required property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The maximum value of the property which the Secretary may require as section 6166 lien property with respect to any estate shall be a value which is not greater than the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the deferred amount, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the required interest amount.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the value of any property shall be determined as of the date prescribed by section 6151(a) for payment of the tax imposed by chapter 11 and shall be determined by taking into account any encumbrance such as a lien under section 6324B.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Partial substitution of bond for lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the value required as section 6166 lien property pursuant to paragraph (2) exceeds the value of the interests in property covered by the agreement referred to in subsection (c), the Secretary may accept bond in an amount equal to such excess conditioned on the payment of the amount extended in accordance with the terms of such extension.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The agreement referred to in this subsection is a written agreement signed by each person in being who has an interest (whether or not in possession) in any property designated in such agreement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consenting to the creation of the lien under this section with respect to such property, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) designating a responsible person who shall be the agent for the beneficiaries of the estate and for the persons who have consented to the creation of the lien in dealings with the Secretary on matters arising under section 6166 or this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirement that lien be filed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The lien imposed by this section shall not be valid as against any purchaser, holder of a security interest, mechanic's lien, or judgment lien creditor until notice thereof which meets the requirements of section 6323(f) has been filed by the Secretary. Such notice shall not be required to be refiled.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Period of lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The lien imposed by this section shall arise at the time the executor is discharged from liability under section 2204 (or, if earlier, at the time notice is filed pursuant to paragraph (1)) and shall continue until the liability for the deferred amount is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Priorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Even though notice of a lien imposed by this section has been filed as provided in paragraph (1), such lien shall not be valid&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Real property tax and special assessment liens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent provided in section 6323(b)(6).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Real property subject to a mechanic's lien for repairs and improvement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any real property subject to a lien for repair or improvement, as against a mechanic's lienor.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Real property construction or improvement financing agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">As against any security interest set forth in paragraph (3) of section 6323(c) (whether such security interest came into existence before or after tax lien filing).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Subparagraphs (B) and (C) shall not apply to any security interest which came into existence after the date on which the Secretary filed notice (in a manner similar to notice filed under section 6323(f)) that payment of the deferred amount has been accelerated under section 6166(g).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Lien to be in lieu of section 6324 lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If there is a lien under this section on any property with respect to any estate, there shall not be any lien under section 6324 on such property with respect to the same estate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Additional lien property required in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If at any time the value of the property covered by the agreement is less than the unpaid portion of the deferred amount and the re<!-- PDFPage:2580 -->quired interest amount, the Secretary may require the addition of property to the agreement (but he may not require under this paragraph that the value of the property covered by the agreement exceed such unpaid portion). If property having the required value is not added to the property covered by the agreement (or if other security equal to the required value is not furnished) within 90 days after notice and demand therefor by the Secretary, the failure to comply with the preceding sentence shall be treated as an act accelerating payment of the installments under section 6166(g).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Lien to be in lieu of bond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may not require under section 6165 the furnishing of any bond for the payment of any tax to which an agreement which meets the requirements of subsection (c) applies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Deferred amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;deferred amount&rdquo; means the aggregate amount deferred under section 6166 (determined as of the date prescribed by section 6151(a) for payment of the tax imposed by chapter 11).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Required interest amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;required interest amount&rdquo; means the aggregate amount of interest which will be payable over the first 4 years of the deferral period with respect to the deferred amount (determined as of the date prescribed by section 6151(a) for the payment of the tax imposed by chapter 11).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Deferral period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;deferral period&rdquo; means the period for which the payment of tax is deferred pursuant to the election under section 6166.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Application of definitions in case of deficiencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a deficiency, a separate deferred amount, required interest amount, and deferral period shall be determined as of the due date of the first installment after the deficiency is prorated to installments under section 6166.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6325. Release of lien or discharge of property</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Release of lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary shall issue a certificate of release of any lien imposed with respect to any internal revenue tax not later than 30 days after the day on which&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Liability satisfied or unenforceable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary finds that the liability for the amount assessed, together with all interest in respect thereof, has been fully satisfied or has become legally unenforceable; or</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Bond accepted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There is furnished to the Secretary and accepted by him a bond that is conditioned upon the payment of the amount assessed, together with all interest in respect thereof, within the time prescribed by law (including any extension of such time), and that is in accordance with such requirements relating to terms, conditions, and form of the bond and sureties thereon, as may be specified by such regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Discharge of property</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Property double the amount of the liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to any lien imposed under this chapter if the Secretary finds that the fair market value of that part of such property remaining subject to the lien is at least double the amount of the unsatisfied liability secured by such lien and the amount of all other liens upon such property which have priority over such lien.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Part payment; interest of United States valueless</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to the lien if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) there is paid over to the Secretary in partial satisfaction of the liability secured by the lien an amount determined by the Secretary, which shall not be less than the value, as determined by the Secretary, of the interest of the United States in the part to be so discharged, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary determines at any time that the interest of the United States in the part to be so discharged has no value.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In determining the value of the interest of the United States in the part to be so discharged, the Secretary shall give consideration to the value of such part and to such liens thereon as have priority over the lien of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Substitution of proceeds of sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to the lien if such part of the property is sold and, pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary, the proceeds of such sale are to be held, as a fund subject to the liens and claims of the United States, in the same manner and with the same priority as such liens and claims had with respect to the discharged property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Estate or gift tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may issue a certificate of discharge of any or all of the property subject to any lien imposed by section 6324 if the Secretary finds that the liability secured by such lien has been fully satisfied or provided for.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Subordination of lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may issue a certificate of subordination of any lien imposed by this chapter upon any part of the property subject to such lien if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is paid over to the Secretary an amount equal to the amount of the lien or interest to which the certificate subordinates the lien of the United States,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary believes that the amount realizable by the United States from the property to which the certificate relates, or from any other property subject to the lien, will ultimately be increased by reason of the issuance of such certificate and that the ultimate collection of the tax liability will be facilitated by such subordination, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of any lien imposed by section 6324B, if the Secretary determines that the United States will be adequately secured after such subordination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Nonattachment of lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary determines that, because of confusion of names or otherwise, any person <!-- PDFPage:2582 -->(other than the person against whom the tax was assessed) is or may be injured by the appearance that a notice of lien filed under section 6323 refers to such person, the Secretary may issue a certificate that the lien does not attach to the property of such person.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Effect of certificate</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Conclusiveness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), if a certificate is issued pursuant to this section by the Secretary and is filed in the same office as the notice of lien to which it relates (if such notice of lien has been filed) such certificate shall have the following effect:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a certificate of release, such certificate shall be conclusive that the lien referred to in such certificate is extinguished;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a certificate of discharge, such certificate shall be conclusive that the property covered by such certificate is discharged from the lien;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of a certificate of subordination, such certificate shall be conclusive that the lien or interest to which the lien of the United States is subordinated is superior to the lien of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in the case of a certificate of nonattachment, such certificate shall be conclusive that the lien of the United States does not attach to the property of the person referred to in such certificate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Revocation of certificate of release or nonattachment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that a certificate of release or nonattachment of a lien imposed by section 6321 was issued erroneously or improvidently, or if a certificate of release of such lien was issued pursuant to a collateral agreement entered into in connection with a compromise under section 7122 which has been breached, and if the period of limitation on collection after assessment has not expired, the Secretary may revoke such certificate and reinstate the lien&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by mailing notice of such revocation to the person against whom the tax was assessed at his last known address, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by filing notice of such revocation in the same office in which the notice of lien to which it relates was filed (if such notice of lien had been filed).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Such reinstated lien (i) shall be effective on the date notice of revocation is mailed to the taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (A), but not earlier than the date on which any required filing of notice of revocation is filed in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (B), and (ii) shall have the same force and effect (as of such date), until the expiration of the period of limitation on collection after assessment, as a lien imposed by section 6321 (relating to lien for taxes).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certificates void under certain conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, any lien imposed by this chapter shall attach to any property with respect to which a certificate of discharge has been issued if the person liable for the tax reacquires such property after such certificate has been issued.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Filing of certificates and notices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a certificate or notice issued pursuant to this section may not be filed in the office designated by State law in which the notice of lien imposed by section 6321 is filed, such certificate or notice shall be effective if filed in the office of the clerk of the United States district court for the judicial district in which such office is situated.</p>
