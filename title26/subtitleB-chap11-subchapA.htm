<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2013. Credit for tax on prior transfers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The tax imposed by section 2001 shall be credited with all or a part of the amount of the Federal estate tax paid with respect to the transfer of property (including property passing as a result of the exercise or non-exercise of a power of appointment) to the decedent by or from a person (herein designated as a &ldquo;transferor&rdquo;) who died within 10 years before, or within 2 years after, the decedent's death. If the transferor died within 2 years of the death of the decedent, the credit shall be the amount determined under subsections (b) and (c). If the transferor predeceased the decedent by more than 2 years, the credit shall be the following percentage of the amount so determined&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 80 percent, if within the third or fourth years preceding the decedent's death;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 60 percent, if within the fifth or sixth years preceding the decedent's death;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) 40 percent, if within the seventh or eighth years preceding the decedent's death; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) 20 percent, if within the ninth or tenth years preceding the decedent's death.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation of credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the limitation prescribed in subsection (c), the credit provided by this section shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the estate tax paid (adjusted as indicated hereinafter) with respect to the estate of the transferor as the value of the property transferred bears to the taxable estate of the transferor (determined for purposes of the estate tax) decreased by any death taxes paid with respect to such estate. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the estate tax paid shall be the Federal estate tax paid increased by any credits allowed against such estate tax under section 2012, or corresponding provisions of prior laws, on account of gift tax, and for any credits allowed against such estate tax under this section on account of prior transfers where the transferor acquired property from a person who died within 10 years before the death of the decedent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation on credit</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The credit provided in this section shall not exceed the amount by which&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2223 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the estate tax imposed by section 2001 or section 2101 (after deducting the credits provided for in sections 2010, 2012, and 2014) computed without regard to this section, exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such tax computed by excluding from the decedent's gross estate the value of such property transferred and, if applicable, by making the adjustment hereinafter indicated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If any deduction is otherwise allowable under section 2055 or section 2106(a)(2) (relating to charitable deduction) then, for the purpose of the computation indicated in subparagraph (B), the amount of such deduction shall be reduced by that part of such deduction which the value of such property transferred bears to the decedent's entire gross estate reduced by the deductions allowed under sections 2053 and 2054, or section 2106(a)(1) (relating to deduction for expenses, losses, etc.). For purposes of this section, the value of such property transferred shall be the value as provided for in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Two or more transferors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the credit provided in this section relates to property received from 2 or more transferors, the limitation provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be computed by aggregating the value of the property so transferred to the decedent. The aggregate limitation so determined shall be apportioned in accordance with the value of the property transferred to the decedent by each transferor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Valuation of property transferred</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The value of property transferred to the decedent shall be the value used for the purpose of determining the Federal estate tax liability of the estate of the transferor but&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there shall be taken into account the effect of the tax imposed by section 2001 or 2101, or any estate, succession, legacy, or inheritance tax, on the net value to the decedent of such property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) where such property is encumbered in any manner, or where the decedent incurs any obligation imposed by the transferor with respect to such property, such encumbrance or obligation shall be taken into account in the same manner as if the amount of a gift to the decedent of such property was being determined; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if the decedent was the spouse of the transferor at the time of the transferor's death, the net value of the property transferred to the decedent shall be reduced by the amount allowed under section 2056 (relating to marital deductions), as a deduction from the gross estate of the transferor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Property defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;property&rdquo; includes any beneficial interest in property, including a general power of appointment (as defined in section 2041).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Treatment of additional tax imposed under section 2032A</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If section 2032A applies to any property included in the gross estate of the transferor and an additional tax is imposed with respect to such property under section 2032A(c) before the date which is 2 years after the date of the decedent's death, for purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the additional tax imposed by section 2032A(c) shall be treated as a Federal estate tax payable with respect to the estate of the transferor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the value of such property and the amount of the taxable estate of the transferor shall be determined as if section 2032A did not apply with respect to such property.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The tax imposed by section 2001 shall be credited with the amount of any estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes actually paid to any foreign country in respect of any property situated within such foreign country and included in the gross estate (not including any such taxes paid with respect to the estate of a person other than the decedent). The determination of the country within which property is situated shall be made in accordance with the rules applicable under subchapter B (sec. 2101 and following) in determining whether property is situated within or without the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The credit provided in this section with respect to such taxes paid to any foreign country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall not, with respect to any such tax, exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of such tax actually paid to such foreign country as the value of property which is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) situated within such foreign country,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) subjected to such tax, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall not, with respect to all such taxes, exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to the tax imposed by section 2001 (after deducting from such tax the credits provided by sections 2010 and 2012) as the value of property which is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) situated within such foreign country,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) subjected to the taxes of such foreign country, and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Valuation of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The values referred to in the ratio stated in subsection (b)(1) are the values determined for purposes of the tax imposed by such foreign country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The values referred to in the ratio stated in subsection (b)(2) are the values determined under this chapter; but, in applying such ratio, the value of any property described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) thereof shall be reduced by such amount as will properly reflect, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the deductions allowed in respect of such property under sections 2055 and 2056 (relating to charitable and marital deductions).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Proof of credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The credit provided in this section shall be allowed only if the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) all other information necessary for the verification and computation of the credit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Period of limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The credit provided in this section shall be allowed only for such taxes as were actually paid and credit therefor claimed within 4 years after the filing of the return required by section 6018, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If a petition for redetermination of a deficiency has been filed with the Tax Court within the time prescribed in section 6213(a), then within such 4-year period or before the expiration of 60 days after the decision of the Tax Court becomes final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If, under section 6161, an extension of time has been granted for payment of the tax shown on the return, or of a deficiency, then within such 4-year period or before the date of the expiration of the period of the extension.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Refund based on such credit may (despite the provisions of sections 6511 and 6512) be made if claim therefor is filed within the period above provided. Any such refund shall be made without interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Additional limitation in cases involving a deduction under section 2053(d)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case where a deduction is allowed under section 2053(d) for an estate, succession, legacy, or inheritance tax imposed by and actually paid to any foreign country upon a transfer by the decedent for public, charitable, or religious uses described in section 2055, the property described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b) of this section shall not include any property in respect of which such deduction is allowed under section 2053(d).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Possession of United States deemed a foreign country</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Similar credit required for certain alien residents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the President finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a foreign country, in imposing estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes, does not allow to citizens of the United States resident in such foreign country at the time of death a credit similar to the credit allowed under subsection (a),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such foreign country, when requested by the United States to do so has not acted to <!-- PDFPage:2225 -->provide such a similar credit in the case of citizens of the United States resident in such foreign country at the time of death, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) it is in the public interest to allow the credit under subsection (a) in the case of citizens or subjects of such foreign country only if it allows such a similar credit in the case of citizens of the United States resident in such foreign country at the time of death,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the President shall proclaim that, in the case of citizens or subjects of such foreign country dying while the proclamation remains in effect, the credit under subsection (a) shall be allowed only if such foreign country allows such a similar credit in the case of citizens of the United States resident in such foreign country at the time of death.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purposes of subparagraph (A), the determination of whether property is qualified real property with respect to the first decedent shall be made without regard to subparagraph (D) of paragraph (1) and without regard to whether an election under this section was made.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjusted tax difference attributable to interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the adjusted tax difference attributable to an interest is the amount which bears the same ratio to the adjusted tax difference with respect to the estate (determined under subparagraph (C)) as&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The value of the gross estate shall include the value of all property to the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time after September 7, 1916, made a transfer (except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth), by trust or otherwise, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) possession or enjoyment of the property can, through ownership of such interest, be obtained only by surviving the decedent, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the decedent has retained a reversionary interest in the property (but in the case of a transfer made before October 8, 1949, only if such reversionary interest arose by the express terms of the instrument of transfer), and the value of such reversionary interest immediately before the death of the decedent exceeds 5 percent of the value of such property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;reversionary interest&rdquo; includes a possibility that property transferred by the decedent&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may return to him or his estate, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may be subject to a power of disposition by him,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">but such term does not include a possibility that the income alone from such property may return to him or become subject to a power of disposition by him. The value of a reversionary interest immediately before the death of the decedent shall be determined (without regard to the fact of the decedent's death) by usual methods of valuation, including the use of tables of mortality and actuarial principles, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. In determining the value of a possibility that property may be subject to a power of disposition by the decedent, such possibility shall be valued as if it were a possibility that such property may return to the decedent or his estate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an interest so transferred shall not be included in the decedent's gross estate under this section if possession or enjoyment of the property could have been obtained by any beneficiary during the decedent's life through the exercise of a general power of appointment (as defined in section 2041) which in fact was exercisable immediately before the decedent's death.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of the tax imposed by section 2001, the value of the taxable estate shall be determined by deducting from the value of the gross estate such amounts&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for funeral expenses,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for administration expenses,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for claims against the estate, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) for unpaid mortgages on, or any indebtedness in respect of, property where the value of the decedent's interest therein, undiminished by such mortgage or indebtedness, is included in the value of the gross estate,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">as are allowable by the laws of the jurisdiction, whether within or without the United States, under which the estate is being administered.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Other administration expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the limitations in paragraph (1) of subsection (c), there shall be deducted in determining the taxable estate amounts representing expenses incurred in administering property not subject to claims which is included in the gross estate to the same extent such amounts would be allowable as a deduction under subsection (a) if such property were subject to claims, and such amounts are paid before the expiration of the period of limitation for assessment provided in section 6501.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitations applicable to subsections (a) and (b)</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Consideration for claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The deduction allowed by this section in the case of claims against the estate, unpaid mortgages, or any indebtedness shall, when founded on a promise or agreement, be limited to the extent that they were contracted bona fide and for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth; except that in any case in which any such claim is founded on a promise or agreement of the decedent to make a contribution or gift to or for the use of any donee described in section 2055 for the purposes specified therein, the deduction for such claims shall not be so limited, but shall be limited to the extent that it would be allowable as a deduction under section 2055 if such promise or agreement constituted a bequest.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certain taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any income taxes on income received after the death of the decedent, or property taxes not accrued before his death, or any estate, succession, legacy, or inheritance taxes, shall not be deductible under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Certain claims by remaindermen</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No deduction shall be allowed under this section for a claim against the estate by a remainderman relating to any property described in section 2044.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Section 6166 interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No deduction shall be allowed under this section for any interest payable under section 6601 on any unpaid portion of the tax imposed by section 2001 for the period during which an extension of time for payment of such tax is in effect under section 6166.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitations applicable only to subsection (a)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of the amounts described in subsection (a), there shall be disallowed the amount by which the deductions specified therein exceed the value, at the time of the decedent's death, of property subject to claims, except to the extent that such deductions represent amounts paid before the date prescribed for the filing of the estate tax return. For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;property subject to claims&rdquo; means property includible in the gross estate of the decedent which, or the avails of which, would under the applicable law, bear the burden of the payment of such deductions in the final adjustment and settlement of the estate, except that the value of the property shall be reduced by the amount of the deduction under section 2054 attributable to such property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Certain foreign death taxes</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c)(1)(B), for purposes of the tax imposed by section 2001, the value of the taxable estate may be determined, if the executor so elects before the expiration of the period of limitation for assessment provided in section 6501, by deducting from the value of the gross estate the amount (as determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary) of any estate, succession, legacy, or inheritance tax imposed by and actually paid to any foreign country, in respect of any property situated within such foreign country and included in the gross estate of a citizen or resident of the United States, upon a transfer by the decedent for public, charitable, or religious uses described in section 2055. The determination under this paragraph of the country within which property is situated shall be made in accordance with the rules applicable under subchapter B (sec. 2101 and following) in determining whether property is situated within or without the United States. Any election under this paragraph shall be exercised in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Condition for allowance of deduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No deduction shall be allowed under paragraph (1) for a foreign death tax specified therein unless the decrease in the tax imposed by section 2001 which results from the deduction provided in paragraph (1) will inure solely for the benefit of the public, charitable, or religious transferees described in section 2055 or <!-- PDFPage:2251 -->section 2106(a)(2). In any case where the tax imposed by section 2001 is equitably apportioned among all the transferees of property included in the gross estate, including those described in sections 2055 and 2106(a)(2) (taking into account any exemptions, credits, or deductions allowed by this chapter), in determining such decrease, there shall be disregarded any decrease in the Federal estate tax which any transferees other than those described in sections 2055 and 2106(a)(2) are required to pay.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect on credit for foreign death taxes of deduction under this subsection</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An election under this subsection shall be deemed a waiver of the right to claim a credit, against the Federal estate tax, under a death tax convention with any foreign country for any tax or portion thereof in respect of which a deduction is taken under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Cross reference</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>See section 2014(f) for the effect of a deduction taken under this paragraph on the credit for foreign death taxes.</strong></p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Marital rights</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>For provisions treating certain relinquishments of marital rights as consideration in money or money's worth, see section 2043(b)(2).</strong></p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of the tax imposed by section 2001, the value of the taxable estate shall, except as limited by subsection (b), be determined by deducting from the value of the gross estate an amount equal to the value of any interest in property which passes or has passed from the decedent to his surviving spouse, but only to the extent that such interest is included in determining the value of the gross estate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation in the case of life estate or other terminable interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where, on the lapse of time, on the occurrence of an event or contingency, or on the failure of an event or contingency to occur, an interest passing to the surviving spouse will terminate or fail, no deduction shall be allowed under this section with respect to such interest&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if an interest in such property passes or has passed (for less than an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth) from the decedent to any person other than such surviving spouse (or the estate of such spouse); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if by reason of such passing such person (or his heirs or assigns) may possess or enjoy any part of such property after such termination or failure of the interest so passing to the surviving spouse;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this paragraph, an interest shall not be considered as an interest which will terminate or fail merely because it is the ownership of a bond, note, or similar contractual obligation, the discharge of which would not have the effect of an annuity for life or for a term.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Interest in unidentified assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where the assets (included in the decedent's gross estate) out of which, or the proceeds of which, an interest passing to the surviving spouse may be satisfied include a particular asset or assets with respect to which no deduction would be allowed if such asset or assets passed from the decedent to such spouse, then the value of such interest passing to such spouse shall, for purposes of subsection (a), be reduced by the aggregate value of such particular assets.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such death will cause a termination or failure of such interest only if it occurs within a period not exceeding 6 months after the decedent's death, or only if it occurs as a result of a common disaster resulting in the death of the decedent and the surviving spouse, or only if it occurs in the case of either such event; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such termination or failure does not in fact occur.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining for purposes of subsection (a) the value of any interest in property passing to the surviving spouse for which a deduction is allowed by this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) there shall be taken into account the effect which the tax imposed by section 2001, or any estate, succession, legacy, or inheritance tax, has on the net value to the surviving spouse of such interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) where such interest or property is encumbered in any manner, or where the surviving spouse incurs any obligation imposed by the decedent with respect to the passing of such interest, such encumbrance or obligation shall be taken into account in the same manner as if the amount of a gift to such spouse of such interest were being determined.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Life estate with power of appointment in surviving spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an interest in property passing from the decedent, if his surviving spouse is entitled for life to all the income from the entire interest, or all the income from a specific portion thereof, payable annually or at more frequent intervals, with power in the surviving spouse to appoint the entire interest, or such specific portion (exercisable in favor of such surviving spouse, or of the estate of such surviving spouse, or in favor of either, whether or not in each case the power is exercisable in favor of others), and with no power in any other person to appoint any part of the interest, or such specific portion, to any person other than the surviving spouse&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the interest or such portion thereof so passing shall, for purposes of subsection (a), be considered as passing to the surviving spouse, and</p>
