<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Effect of qualifying transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a share of stock is transferred to an individual in a transfer in respect of which the requirements of section 422(a) or 423(a) are met&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no income shall result at the time of the transfer of such share to the individual upon his exercise of the option with respect to such share;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) no deduction under section 162 (relating to trade or business expenses) shall be allowable at any time to the employer corporation, a parent or subsidiary corporation of such corporation, or a corporation issuing or assuming a stock option in a transaction to which section 424(a) applies, with respect to the share so transferred; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) no amount other than the price paid under the option shall be considered as received by any of such corporations for the share so transferred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Effect of disqualifying disposition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the transfer of a share of stock to an individual pursuant to his exercise of an option would otherwise meet the requirements of section 422(a) or 423(a) except that there is a failure to meet any of the holding period requirements of section 422(a)(1) or 423(a)(1), then any increase in the income of such individual or deduction from the income of his employer corporation for the taxable year in which such exercise occurred attributable to such disposition, shall be treated as an increase in income or a deduction from income in the taxable year of such individual or of such employer corporation in which such disposition occurred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exercise by estate</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an option to which this part applies is exercised after the death of the employee by the estate of the decedent, or by a person who acquired the right to exercise such option by bequest or inheritance or by reason of the death of the decedent, the provisions of subsection (a) shall apply to the same extent as if the option had been exercised by the decedent, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the holding period and employment requirements of sections 422(a) and 423(a) shall not apply, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any transfer by the estate of stock acquired shall be considered a disposition of such stock for purposes of section 423(c).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Deduction for estate tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an amount is required to be included under section 423(c) in gross income of the estate of the deceased employee or of a person described in paragraph (1), there shall be allowed to the estate or such person a deduction with respect to the estate tax attributable to the inclusion in the taxable estate of the deceased employee of the net value for estate tax purposes of the option. For this purpose, the deduction shall be determined under section 691(c) as if the option acquired from the deceased employee were an item of gross income in respect of the decedent under section 691 and as if the amount includible in gross income under section 423(c) were an amount included in gross income under section 691 in respect of such item of gross income.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Basis of shares acquired</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a share of stock acquired by the exercise of an option to which paragraph (1) applies&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the basis of such share shall include so much of the basis of the option as is attributable to such share; except that the basis of such share shall be reduced by the excess (if any) of (i) the amount which would have been includible in gross income under section 423(c) if the employee had exercised the option on the date of his death and had held the share acquired pursuant to such exercise at the time of his death, over (ii) the amount which is includible in gross income under such section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the last sentence of section 423(c) shall apply only to the extent that the amount includible in gross income under such section exceeds so much of the basis of the option as is attributable to such share.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Section 421(a) shall apply with respect to the transfer of a share of stock to an individual pursuant to his exercise of an incentive stock option if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no disposition of such share is made by him within 2 years from the date of the granting of the option nor within 1 year after the transfer of such share to him, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) at all times during the period beginning on the date of the granting of the option and ending on the day 3 months before the date of such exercise, such individual was an employee of either the corporation granting such option, a parent or subsidiary corporation of such corporation, or a corporation or a parent or subsidiary corporation of such corporation issuing or assuming a stock option in a transaction to which section 424(a) applies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Incentive stock option</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;incentive stock option&rdquo; means an option granted to an individual for any reason connected with his employment by a corporation, if granted by the employer corporation or its parent or subsidiary corporation, to purchase stock of any of such corporations, but only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the option is granted pursuant to a plan which includes the aggregate number of shares which may be issued under options and the employees (or class of employees) eligible to receive options, and which is approved by the stockholders of the granting corporation within 12 months before or after the date such plan is adopted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such option is granted within 10 years from the date such plan is adopted, or the date such plan is approved by the stockholders, whichever is earlier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such option by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the date such option is granted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the option price is not less than the fair market value of the stock at the time such option is granted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) such option by its terms is not transferable by such individual otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable, during his lifetime, only by him; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) such individual, at the time the option is granted, does not own stock possessing more than 10 percent of the total combined voting <!-- PDFPage:1073 -->power of all classes of stock of the employer corporation or of its parent or subsidiary corporation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such term shall not include any option if (as of the time the option is granted) the terms of such option provide that it will not be treated as an incentive stock option.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Good faith efforts to value of stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a share of stock is transferred pursuant to the exercise by an individual of an option which would fail to qualify as an incentive stock option under subsection (b) because there was a failure in an attempt, made in good faith, to meet the requirement of subsection (b)(4), the requirement of subsection (b)(4) shall be considered to have been met. To the extent provided in regulations by the Secretary, a similar rule shall apply for purposes of subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain disqualifying dispositions where amount realized is less than value at exercise</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an individual who has acquired a share of stock by the exercise of an incentive stock option makes a disposition of such share within either of the periods described in subsection (a)(1), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such disposition is a sale or exchange with respect to which a loss (if sustained) would be recognized to such individual,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then the amount which is includible in the gross income of such individual, and the amount which is deductible from the income of his employer corporation, as compensation attributable to the exercise of such option shall not exceed the excess (if any) of the amount realized on such sale or exchange over the adjusted basis of such share.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certain transfers by insolvent individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an insolvent individual holds a share of stock acquired pursuant to his exercise of an incentive stock option, and if such share is transferred to a trustee, receiver, or other similar fiduciary in any proceeding under title 11 or any other similar insolvency proceeding, neither such transfer, nor any other transfer of such share for the benefit of his creditors in such proceeding, shall constitute a disposition of such share for purposes of subsection (a)(1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Permissible provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An option which meets the requirements of subsection (b) shall be treated as an incentive stock option even if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the employee may pay for the stock with stock of the corporation granting the option,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the employee has a right to receive property at the time of exercise of the option, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the option is subject to any condition not inconsistent with the provisions of subsection (b).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Subparagraph (B) shall apply to a transfer of property (other than cash) only if section 83 applies to the property so transferred.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) 10-percent shareholder rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (b)(6) shall not apply if at the time such option is granted the option price is at least 110 percent of the fair market value of the stock subject to the option and such option by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of 5 years from the date such option is granted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Special rule when disabled</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (a)(2), in the case of an employee who is disabled (within the meaning of section 22(e)(3)), the 3-month period of subsection (a)(2) shall be 1 year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Fair market value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the fair market value of stock shall be determined without regard to any restriction other than a restriction which, by its terms, will never lapse.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) $100,000 per year limitation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent that the aggregate fair market value of stock with respect to which incentive stock options (determined without regard to this subsection) are exercisable for the 1st time by any individual during any calendar year (under all plans of the individual's employer corporation and its parent and subsidiary corporations) exceeds $100,000, such options shall be treated as options which are not incentive stock options.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Ordering rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall be applied by taking options into account in the order in which they were granted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determination of fair market value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the fair market value of any stock shall be determined as of the time the option with respect to such stock is granted.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;423. Employee stock purchase plans</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Section 421(a) shall apply with respect to the transfer of a share of stock to an individual pursuant to his exercise of an option granted after December 31, 1963, under an employee stock purchase plan (as defined in subsection (b)) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no disposition of such share is made by him within 2 years after the date of the granting of the option nor within 1 year after the transfer of such share to him; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) at all times during the period beginning with the date of the granting of the option and ending on the day 3 months before the date of such exercise, he is an employee of the corporation granting such option, a parent or subsidiary corporation of such corporation, or a corporation or a parent or subsidiary corporation of such corporation issuing or assuming a stock option in a transaction to which section 424(a) applies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Employee stock purchase plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;employee stock purchase plan&rdquo; means a plan which meets the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the plan provides that options are to be granted only to employees of the employer corporation or of its parent or subsidiary corporation to purchase stock in any such corporation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such plan is approved by the stockholders of the granting corporation within 12 months before or after the date such plan is adopted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) under the terms of the plan, no employee can be granted an option if such employee, immediately after the option is granted, owns stock possessing 5 percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the employer corporation or of its parent or subsidiary corporation. For purposes of this paragraph, the rules of section 424(d) shall apply in determining the stock ownership of an individual, and stock which the employee may purchase under outstanding options shall be treated as stock owned by the employee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) under the terms of the plan, options are to be granted to all employees of any corporation whose employees are granted any of such options by reason of their employment by such corporation, except that there may be excluded&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) employees who have been employed less than 2 years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) employees whose customary employment is 20 hours or less per week,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) employees whose customary employment is for not more than 5 months in any calendar year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q));</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) under the terms of the plan, all employees granted such options shall have the same rights and privileges, except that the amount of stock which may be purchased by any employee under such option may bear a uniform relationship to the total compensation, or the basic or regular rate of compensation, of employees, and the plan may provide that no employee may purchase more than a maximum amount of stock fixed under the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) under the terms of the plan, the option price is not less than the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an amount equal to 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock at the time such option is granted, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an amount which under the terms of the option may not be less than 85 percent of the fair market value of the stock at the time such option is exercised;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) under the terms of the plan, such option cannot be exercised after the expiration of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 5 years from the date such option is granted if, under the terms of such plan, the option price is to be not less than 85 percent of the fair market value of such stock at the time of the exercise of the option, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 27 months from the date such option is granted, if the option price is not determinable in the manner described in subparagraph (A)</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) under the terms of the plan, no employee may be granted an option which permits his rights to purchase stock under all such plans of his employer corporation and its parent and subsidiary corporations to accrue at a rate which exceeds $25,000 of fair market value of such stock (determined at the time such op<!-- PDFPage:1076 -->tion is granted) for each calendar year in which such option is outstanding at any time. For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the right to purchase stock under an option accrues when the option (or any portion thereof) first becomes exercisable during the calendar year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the right to purchase stock under an option accrues at the rate provided in the option, but in no case may such rate exceed $25,000 of fair market value of such stock (determined at the time such option is granted) for any one calendar year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a right to purchase stock which has accrued under one option granted pursuant to the plan may not be carried over to any other option; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) under the terms of the plan, such option is not transferable by such individual otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable, during his lifetime, only by him.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of paragraphs (3) to (9), inclusive, where additional terms are contained in an offering made under a plan, such additional terms shall, with respect to options exercised under such offering, be treated as a part of the terms of such plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rule where option price is between 85 percent and 100 percent of value of stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the option price of a share of stock acquired by an individual pursuant to a transfer to which subsection (a) applies was less than 100 percent of the fair market value of such share at the time such option was granted, then, in the event of any disposition of such share by him which meets the holding period requirements of subsection (a), or in the event of his death (whenever occurring) while owning such share, there shall be included as compensation (and not as gain upon the sale or exchange of a capital asset) in his gross income, for the taxable year in which falls the date of such disposition or for the taxable year closing with his death, whichever applies, an amount equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the excess of the fair market value of the share at the time of such disposition or death over the amount paid for the share under the option, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the excess of the fair market value of the share at the time the option was granted over the option price.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the option price is not fixed or determinable at the time the option is granted, then for purposes of this subsection, the option price shall be determined as if the option were exercised at such time. In the case of the disposition of such share by the individual, the basis of the share in his hands at the time of such disposition shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount so includible in his gross income.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the new option or the assumption of the old option does not give the employee additional benefits which he did not have under the old option.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The acquisition of a share of stock in the name of the employee and another jointly with the right of survivorship or a subsequent transfer of a share of stock into such joint ownership shall not be deemed a disposition, but a termination of such joint tenancy (except to the extent such employee acquires ownership of such stock) shall be treated as a disposition by him occurring at the time such joint tenancy is terminated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule where incentive stock is acquired through use of other statutory option stock</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) attributable to the issuance or assumption of an option under subsection (a);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to permit the option to qualify under section 423(b)(9); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of an option not immediately exercisable in full, to accelerate the time at which the option may be exercised.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Stockholder approval</h4>
