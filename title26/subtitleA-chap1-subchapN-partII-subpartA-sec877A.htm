<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subtitle&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1857 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Mark to market</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All property of a covered expatriate shall be treated as sold on the day before the expatriation date for its fair market value.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Recognition of gain or loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any sale under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) notwithstanding any other provision of this title, any gain arising from such sale shall be taken into account for the taxable year of the sale, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any loss arising from such sale shall be taken into account for the taxable year of the sale to the extent otherwise provided by this title, except that section 1091 shall not apply to any such loss.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Proper adjustment shall be made in the amount of any gain or loss subsequently realized for gain or loss taken into account under the preceding sentence, determined without regard to paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exclusion for certain gain</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount which would (but for this paragraph) be includible in the gross income of any individual by reason of paragraph (1) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by $600,000.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjustment for inflation</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2008, the dollar amount in subparagraph (A) shall be increased by an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) such dollar amount, multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins, by substituting &ldquo;calendar year 2007&rdquo; for &ldquo;calendar year 1992&rdquo; in subparagraph (B) thereof.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Rounding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If any amount as adjusted under clause (i) is not a multiple of $1,000, such amount shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Election to defer tax</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the taxpayer elects the application of this subsection with respect to any property treated as sold by reason of subsection (a), the time for payment of the additional tax attributable to such property shall be extended until the due date of the return for the taxable year in which such property is disposed of (or, in the case of property disposed of in a transaction in which gain is not recognized in whole or in part, until such other date as the Secretary may prescribe).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of tax with respect to property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the additional tax attributable to any property is an amount which bears the same ratio to the additional tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year solely by reason of subsection (a) as the gain taken into account under subsection (a) with respect to such property bears to the total gain taken into account under subsection (a) with respect to all property to which subsection (a) applies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Termination of extension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The due date for payment of tax may not be extended under this subsection later than the due date for the return of tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year which includes the date of death of the expatriate (or, if earlier, the time that the security provided with respect to the property fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (4), unless the taxpayer corrects such failure within the time specified by the Secretary).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Security</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No election may be made under paragraph (1) with respect to any property unless adequate security is provided with respect to such property.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adequate security</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), security with respect to any property shall be treated as adequate security if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) it is a bond which is furnished to, and accepted by, the Secretary, which is conditioned on the payment of tax (and interest thereon), and which meets the requirements of section 6325, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) it is another form of security for such payment (including letters of credit) that meets such requirements as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Waiver of certain rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No election may be made under paragraph (1) unless the taxpayer makes an irrevocable waiver of any right under any treaty of the United States which would preclude assessment or collection of any tax imposed by reason of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Elections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An election under paragraph (1) shall only apply to property described in the election and, once made, is irrevocable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of section 6601, the last date for the payment of tax shall be determined without regard to the election under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exception for certain property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) shall not apply to&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Taxable payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;taxable payment&rdquo; means with respect to a covered expatriate any payment to the extent it would be includible in the gross income of the covered expatriate if such expatriate continued to be subject to tax as a citizen or resident of the United States. A deferred compensation item shall be taken into account as a payment under the preceding sentence when such item would be so includible.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other deferred compensation items</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) with respect to any deferred compensation item to which clause (ii) does not apply, an amount equal to the present value of the covered expatriate's accrued benefit shall be treated as having been received by such individual on the day before the expatriation date as a distribution under the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) with respect to any deferred compensation item referred to in paragraph (4)(D), the rights of the covered expatriate to such item shall be treated as becoming transferable and not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture on the day before the expatriation date,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) no early distribution tax shall apply by reason of such treatment, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) appropriate adjustments shall be made to subsequent distributions from the plan to reflect such treatment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Eligible deferred compensation items</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a person who is not a United States person but who elects to be treated as a United States person for purposes of paragraph (1) and meets such requirements as the Secretary may provide to ensure that the payor will meet the requirements of paragraph (1), and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the covered expatriate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) notifies the payor of his status as a covered expatriate, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) makes an irrevocable waiver of any right to claim any reduction under any treaty with the United States in withholding on such item.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Coordination with other withholding requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any item subject to withholding under paragraph (1) shall not be subject to withholding under section 1441 or chapter 24.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Treatment of specified tax deferred accounts</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the fair market value of such property exceeds its adjusted basis in the hands of the trust, gain shall be recognized to the <!-- PDFPage:1859 -->trust as if such property were sold to the expatriate at its fair market value.</p>
