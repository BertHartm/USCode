<h3 class="section-head">&sect;302. Distributions in redemption of stock</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a corporation redeems its stock (within the meaning of section 317(b)), and if paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or (5) of subsection (b) applies, such redemption shall be treated as a distribution in part or full payment in exchange for the stock.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Redemptions treated as exchanges</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Redemptions not equivalent to dividends</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (a) shall apply if the redemption is not essentially equivalent to a dividend.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Substantially disproportionate redemption of stock</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subsection (a) shall apply if the distribution is substantially disproportionate with respect to the shareholder.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This paragraph shall not apply unless immediately after the redemption the shareholder owns less than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the distribution is substantially disproportionate if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the ratio which the voting stock of the corporation owned by the shareholder immediately after the redemption bears to all of the voting stock of the corporation at such time,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">is less than 80 percent of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the ratio which the voting stock of the corporation owned by the shareholder immediately before the redemption bears to all of the voting stock of the corporation at such time.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, no distribution shall be treated as substantially disproportionate unless the shareholder's ownership of the common stock of the corporation (whether voting or nonvoting) after and before redemption also meets the 80 percent requirement of the preceding sentence. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if there is more than one class of common stock, the determinations shall be made by reference to fair market value.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Series of redemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This paragraph shall not apply to any redemption made pursuant to a plan the purpose or effect of which is a series of redemptions resulting in a distribution which (in the aggregate) is not substantially disproportionate with respect to the shareholder.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Termination of shareholder's interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (a) shall apply if the redemption is in complete redemption of all of the stock of the corporation owned by the shareholder.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Redemption from noncorporate shareholder in partial liquidation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (a) shall apply to a distribution if such distribution is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in redemption of stock held by a shareholder who is not a corporation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in partial liquidation of the distributing corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Redemptions by certain regulated investment companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, subsection (a) shall apply to any distribution in redemption of stock of a publicly offered regulated investment company (within the meaning of section 67(c)(2)(B)) if&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:946 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such redemption is upon the demand of the stockholder, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such company issues only stock which is redeemable upon the demand of the stockholder.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Application of paragraphs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining whether a redemption meets the requirements of paragraph (1), the fact that such redemption fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (2), (3), or (4) shall not be taken into account. If a redemption meets the requirements of paragraph (3) and also the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), or (4), then so much of subsection (c)(2) as would (but for this sentence) apply in respect of the acquisition of an interest in the corporation within the 10-year period beginning on the date of the distribution shall not apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Constructive ownership of stock</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, section 318(a) shall apply in determining the ownership of stock for purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) For determining termination of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) In the case of a distribution described in subsection (b)(3), section 318(a)(1) shall not apply if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) immediately after the distribution the distributee has no interest in the corporation (including an interest as officer, director, or employee), other than an interest as a creditor,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the distributee does not acquire any such interest (other than stock acquired by bequest or inheritance) within 10 years from the date of such distribution, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the distributee, at such time and in such manner as the Secretary by regulations prescribes, files an agreement to notify the Secretary of any acquisition described in clause (ii) and to retain such records as may be necessary for the application of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">If the distributee acquires such an interest in the corporation (other than by bequest or inheritance) within 10 years from the date of the distribution, then the periods of limitation provided in sections 6501 and 6502 on the making of an assessment and the collection by levy or a proceeding in court shall, with respect to any deficiency (including interest and additions to the tax) resulting from such acquisition, include one year immediately following the date on which the distributee (in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary) notifies the Secretary of such acquisition; and such assessment and collection may be made notwithstanding any provision of law or rule of law which otherwise would prevent such assessment and collection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not apply if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any portion of the stock redeemed was acquired, directly or indirectly, within the 10-year period ending on the date of the distribution by the distributee from a person the ownership of whose stock would (at the time of distribution) be attributable to the distributee under section 318(a), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any person owns (at the time of the distribution) stock the ownership of which is attributable to the distributee under section 318(a) and such person acquired any stock in the corporation, directly or indirectly, from the distributee within the 10-year period ending on the date of the distribution, unless such stock so acquired from the distributee is redeemed in the same transaction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The preceding sentence shall not apply if the acquisition (or, in the case of clause (ii), the disposition) by the distributee did not have as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of Federal income tax.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Special rule for waivers by entities</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to a distribution to any entity unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) such entity and each related person meet the requirements of clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph (A), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) each related person agrees to be jointly and severally liable for any deficiency (including interest and additions to tax) resulting from an acquisition described in clause (ii) of subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;In any case to which the preceding sentence applies, the second sentence of subparagraph (A) and subparagraph (B)(ii) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;distributee or any related person&rdquo; for &ldquo;distributee&rdquo; each place it appears.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the term &ldquo;entity&rdquo; means a partnership, estate, trust, or corporation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the term &ldquo;related person&rdquo; means any person to whom ownership of stock in the corporation is (at the time of the distribution) attributable under section 318(a)(1) if such stock is further attributable to the entity under section 318(a)(3).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Redemptions treated as distributions of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, if a corporation redeems its stock (within the meaning of section 317(b)), and if subsection (a) of this section does not apply, such redemption shall be treated as a distribution of property to which section 301 applies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Partial liquidation defined</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (b)(4), a distribution shall be treated as in partial liquidation of a corporation if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the distribution is not essentially equivalent to a dividend (determined at the corporate level rather than at the shareholder level), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the distribution is pursuant to a plan and occurs within the taxable year in which <!-- PDFPage:947 -->the plan is adopted or within the succeeding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Termination of business</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The distributions which meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(A) shall include (but shall not be limited to) a distribution which meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The distribution is attributable to the distributing corporation's ceasing to conduct, or consists of the assets of, a qualified trade or business.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Immediately after the distribution, the distributing corporation is actively engaged in the conduct of a qualified trade or business.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Qualified trade or business</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (2), the term &ldquo;qualified trade or business&rdquo; means any trade or business which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) was actively conducted throughout the 5-year period ending on the date of the redemption, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) was not acquired by the corporation within such period in a transaction in which gain or loss was recognized in whole or in part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Redemption may be pro rata</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whether or not a redemption meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2) shall be determined without regard to whether or not the redemption is pro rata with respect to all of the shareholders of the corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Treatment of certain pass-thru entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of determining under subsection (b)(4) whether any stock is held by a shareholder who is not a corporation, any stock held by a partnership, estate, or trust shall be treated as if it were actually held proportionately by its partners or beneficiaries.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The distribution to a distributee by or on behalf of a corporation of its stock or securities, of stock or securities in another corporation, or of property, in a distribution to which this title applies, shall not be considered a distribution of the earnings and profits of any corporation&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Effect on earnings and profits of gain or loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The gain or loss realized from the sale or other disposition (after February 28, 1913) of property by a corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for the purpose of the computation of the earnings and profits of the corporation, shall (except as provided in subparagraph (B)) be determined by using as the adjusted basis the adjusted basis (under the law applicable to the year in which the sale or other disposition was made) for determining gain, except that no regard shall be had to the value of the property as of March 1, 1913; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for purposes of the computation of the earnings and profits of the corporation for any period beginning after February 28, 1913, shall be determined by using as the adjusted basis the adjusted basis (under the law applicable to the year in which the sale or other disposition was made) for determining gain.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Gain or loss so realized shall increase or decrease the earnings and profits to, but not beyond, the extent to which such a realized gain or loss was recognized in computing taxable income under the law applicable to the year in which such sale or disposition was made. Where, in determining the adjusted basis used in computing such realized gain or loss, the adjustment to the basis differs from the adjustment proper for the purpose of determining earnings and profits, then the latter adjustment shall be used in determining the increase or decrease above provided. For purposes of this subsection, a loss with respect to which a deduction is disallowed under section 1091 (relating to wash sales of stock or securities), or the corresponding provision of prior law, shall not be deemed to be recognized.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effect on earnings and profits of receipt of tax-free distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where a corporation receives (after February 28, 1913) a distribution from a second corporation which (under the law applicable to the year in which the distribution was made) was not a taxable dividend to the shareholders of the second corporation, the amount of such distribution shall not increase the earnings and profits of the first corporation in the following cases:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) no such increase shall be made in respect of the part of such distribution which (under such law) is directly applied in reduction of the basis of the stock in respect of which the distribution was made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) no such increase shall be made if (under such law) the distribution causes the basis of the stock in respect of which the distribution was made to be allocated between such stock and the property received (or such basis would, but for section 307(b), be so allocated).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Earnings and profits&mdash;increase in value accrued before March 1, 1913</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If any increase or decrease in the earnings and profits for any period beginning after February 28, 1913, with respect to any matter would be different had the adjusted basis of the property involved been determined without regard to its March 1, 1913, value, then, except as provided in paragraph (2), an increase (properly reflecting such difference) shall be made in that part of the earnings and profits consisting of increase in value of property accrued before March 1, 1913.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If the application of subsection (f) to a sale or other disposition after February 28, 1913, results in a loss which is to be applied in decrease of earnings and profits for any period beginning after February 28, 1913, then, notwithstanding subsection (f) and in lieu of the rule provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the amount of such loss so to be applied shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which the adjusted basis of the property used in determining the loss exceeds the adjusted basis computed without regard to the <!-- PDFPage:964 -->value of the property on March 1, 1913, and if such amount so applied in reduction of the decrease exceeds such loss, the excess over such loss shall increase that part of the earnings and profits consisting of increase in value of property accrued before March 1, 1913.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Allocation in certain corporate separations and reorganizations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Section 355</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Section 368(a)(1)(C) or (D)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a reorganization described in subparagraph (C) or (D) of section 368(a)(1), proper allocation with respect to the earnings and profits of the acquired corporation shall, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, be made between the acquiring corporation and the acquired corporation (or any corporation which had control of the acquired corporation before the reorganization).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Distribution of proceeds of loan insured by the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a corporation distributes property with respect to its stock and if, at the time of distribution&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is outstanding a loan to such corporation which was made, guaranteed, or insured by the United States (or by any agency or instrumentality thereof), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of such loan so outstanding exceeds the adjusted basis of the property constituting security for such loan,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the earnings and profits of the corporation shall be increased by the amount of such excess, and (immediately after the distribution) shall be decreased by the amount of such excess. For purposes of paragraph (2), the adjusted basis of the property at the time of distribution shall be determined without regard to any adjustment under section 1016(a)(2) (relating to adjustment for depreciation, etc.). For purposes of this subsection, a commitment to make, guarantee, or insure a loan shall be treated as the making, guaranteeing, or insuring of a loan.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If for any taxable year a method of depreciation was used by the taxpayer which the Secretary has determined results in a reasonable allowance under section 167(a) and which is the unit-of-production method or other method not expressed in a term of years, then the adjustment to earnings and profits for depreciation for such year shall be determined under the method so used (in lieu of the straight line method).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;332. Complete liquidations of subsidiaries</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No gain or loss shall be recognized on the receipt by a corporation of property distributed in complete liquidation of another corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Liquidations to which section applies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, a distribution shall be considered to be in complete liquidation only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the corporation receiving such property was, on the date of the adoption of the plan of liquidation, and has continued to be at all times until the receipt of the property, the owner of stock (in such other corporation) meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2); and either</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the distribution is by such other corporation in complete cancellation or redemption of all its stock, and the transfer of all the property occurs within the taxable year; in such case the adoption by the shareholders of the resolution under which is authorized the distribution of all the assets of such corporation in complete cancellation or redemption of all its stock shall be considered an adoption of a plan of liquidation, even though no time for the completion of the transfer of the property is specified in such resolution; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such distribution is one of a series of distributions by such other corporation in complete cancellation or redemption of all its stock in accordance with a plan of liquidation under which the transfer of all the property under the liquidation is to be completed within 3 years from the close of the taxable year during which is made the first of the series of distributions under the plan, except that if such transfer is not completed within such period, or if the taxpayer does not continue qualified under paragraph (1) until the completion of such transfer, no distribution under the plan shall be considered a distribution in complete liquidation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If such transfer of all the property does not occur within the taxable year, the Secretary may require of the taxpayer such bond, or waiver of the statute of limitations on assessment and collection, or both, as he may deem necessary to insure, if the transfer of the property is not completed within such 3-year period, or if the taxpayer does not continue qualified under paragraph (1) until the completion of such transfer, the assessment and collection of all income taxes then imposed by law for such taxable year or subsequent taxable years, to the extent attributable to property so received. A distribution otherwise constituting a distribution in complete liquidation within the meaning of this subsection shall not be considered as not constituting such a distribution merely because it does not constitute a distribution or liquidation within the meaning of the corporate law under which the distribution is made; and for purposes of this subsection a transfer of property of such other corporation to the taxpayer shall not be considered as not constituting a distribution (or one of a series of distributions) in complete cancellation or redemption of all the stock of such other corporation, merely because the carrying out of the plan involves (A) the transfer under the plan to the taxpayer by such other corporation of property, not attributable to shares owned by the taxpayer, on an exchange described in section 361, and (B) the complete cancellation or redemption under the plan, as a result of exchanges described in section 354, of the shares not owned by the taxpayer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Deductible liquidating distributions of regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a corporation receives a distribution from a regulated investment company or a real estate investment trust which is considered under subsection (b) as being in complete liquidation of such company or trust, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, such corporation shall recognize and treat as a dividend from such company or trust an amount equal to the deduction for dividends paid allowable to such company or trust by reason of such distribution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Recognition of gain on liquidation of certain holding companies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any distribution to a foreign corporation in complete liquidation of an applicable holding company&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) subsection (a) and section 331 shall not apply to such distribution, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such distribution shall be treated as a distribution of property to which section 301 applies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Applicable holding company</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;applicable holding company&rdquo; means any domestic corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) which is a common parent of an affiliated group,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) stock of which is directly owned by the distributee foreign corporation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) substantially all of the assets of which consist of stock in other members of such affiliated group, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) which has not been in existence at all times during the 5 years immediately preceding the date of the liquidation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Affiliated group</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;affiliated group&rdquo; has the meaning given such term by section 1504(a) (without regard to paragraphs (2) and (4) of section 1504(b)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Coordination with subpart F</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the distributee of a distribution described in paragraph (1) is a controlled foreign cor<!-- PDFPage:975 -->poration (as defined in section 957), then notwithstanding paragraph (1) or subsection (a), such distribution shall be treated as a distribution to which section 331 applies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall provide such regulations as appropriate to prevent the abuse of this subsection, including regulations which provide, for the purposes of clause (iv) of paragraph (2)(A), that a corporation is not in existence for any period unless it is engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business or owns a significant ownership interest in another corporation so engaged.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Cross references</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;357. Assumption of liability</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the taxpayer receives property which would be permitted to be received under section 351 or 361 without the recognition of gain if it were the sole consideration, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as part of the consideration, another party to the exchange assumes a liability of the taxpayer,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then such assumption shall not be treated as money or other property, and shall not prevent the exchange from being within the provisions of section 351 or 361, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Tax avoidance purpose</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, taking into consideration the nature of the liability and the circumstances in the light of which the arrangement for the assumption was made, it appears that the principal purpose of the taxpayer with respect to the assumption described in subsection (a)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) was a purpose to avoid Federal income tax on the exchange, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if not such purpose, was not a bona fide business purpose,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then such assumption (in the total amount of the liability assumed pursuant to such exchange) shall, for purposes of section 351 or 361 (as the case may be), be considered as money received by the taxpayer on the exchange.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any suit or proceeding where the burden is on the taxpayer to prove such assumption is not to be treated as money received by the taxpayer, such burden shall not be considered as sustained unless the taxpayer sustains such burden by the clear preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Liabilities in excess of basis</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an exchange&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to which section 351 applies, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to which section 361 applies by reason of a plan of reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(D) with respect to which stock or securities of the corporation to which the assets are transferred are distributed in a transaction which qualifies under section 355,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">if the sum of the amount of the liabilities assumed exceeds the total of the adjusted basis of the property transferred pursuant to such exchange, then such excess shall be considered as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or of property which is not a capital asset, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any exchange&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to which subsection (b)(1) of this section applies, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which is pursuant to a plan of reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(G) where no former shareholder of the transferor corporation receives any consideration for his stock.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certain liabilities excluded</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a taxpayer transfers, in an exchange to which section 351 applies, a liability the payment of which either&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1005 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) would give rise to a deduction, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) would be described in section 736(a),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then, for purposes of paragraph (1), the amount of such liability shall be excluded in determining the amount of liabilities assumed.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any liability to the extent that the incurrence of the liability resulted in the creation of, or an increase in, the basis of any property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of amount of liability assumed</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, section 358(d), section 358(h), section 361(b)(3), section 362(d), section 368(a)(1)(C), and section 368(a)(2)(B), except as provided in regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a recourse liability (or portion thereof) shall be treated as having been assumed if, as determined on the basis of all facts and circumstances, the transferee has agreed to, and is expected to, satisfy such liability (or portion), whether or not the transferor has been relieved of such liability; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) except to the extent provided in paragraph (2), a nonrecourse liability shall be treated as having been assumed by the transferee of any asset subject to such liability.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception for nonrecourse liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the nonrecourse liability treated as described in paragraph (1)(B) shall be reduced by the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of such liability which an owner of other assets not transferred to the transferee and also subject to such liability has agreed with the transferee to, and is expected to, satisfy; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the fair market value of such other assets (determined without regard to section 7701(g)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection and section 362(d). The Secretary may also prescribe regulations which provide that the manner in which a liability is treated as assumed under this subsection is applied, where appropriate, elsewhere in this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an exchange to which section 351, 354, 355, 356, or 361 applies&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Nonrecognition property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The basis of the property permitted to be received under such section without the recognition of gain or loss shall be the same as that of the property exchanged&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) decreased by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the fair market value of any other property (except money) received by the taxpayer,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of any money received by the taxpayer, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the amount of loss to the taxpayer which was recognized on such exchange, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) increased by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount which was treated as a dividend, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount of gain to the taxpayer which was recognized on such exchange (not including any portion of such gain which was treated as a dividend).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The basis of any other property (except money) received by the taxpayer shall be its fair market value.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allocation of basis</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the basis determined under subsection (a)(1) shall be allocated among the properties permitted to be received without the recognition of gain or loss.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule for section 355</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an exchange to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies, then in making the allocation under paragraph (1) of this subsection, there shall be taken into account not only the property so permitted to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, but also the stock or securities (if any) of the distributing corporation which are retained, and the allocation of basis shall be made among all such properties.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Section 355 transactions which are not exchanges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, a distribution to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies shall be treated as an exchange, and for such purposes the stock and securities of the distributing corporation which are retained shall be treated as surrendered, and received back, in the exchange.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assumption of liability</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where, as part of the consideration to the taxpayer, another party to the exchange assumed a liability of the taxpayer, such assumption shall, for purposes of this section, be treated as money received by the taxpayer on the exchange.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the amount of any liability excluded under section 357(c)(3).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exception</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definition of nonrecognition property in case of section 361 exchange</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the property permitted to be received under section 361 without the recognition of gain or loss shall be treated as consisting only of stock or securities in another corporation a party to the reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Adjustments in intragroup transactions involving section 355</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a distribution to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies and which involves the distribution of stock from 1 member of an affiliated group (as defined in section 1504(a) without regard to subsection (b) thereof) to another member of such group, the Secretary may, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, provide adjustments to the adjusted basis of any stock which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is in a corporation which is a member of such group, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is held by another member of such group,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">to appropriately reflect the proper treatment of such distribution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Special rules for assumption of liabilities to which subsection (d) does not apply</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, after application of the other provisions of this section to an exchange or series of exchanges, the basis of property to which sub<!-- PDFPage:1007 -->section (a)(1) applies exceeds the fair market value of such property, then such basis shall be reduced (but not below such fair market value) by the amount (determined as of the date of the exchange) of any liability&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which is assumed by another person as part of the exchange, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with respect to which subsection (d)(1) does not apply to the assumption.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided by the Secretary, paragraph (1) shall not apply to any liability if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the trade or business with which the liability is associated is transferred to the person assuming the liability as part of the exchange, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) substantially all of the assets with which the liability is associated are transferred to the person assuming the liability as part of the exchange.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;liability&rdquo; shall include any fixed or contingent obligation to make payment, without regard to whether the obligation is otherwise taken into account for purposes of this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No gain or loss shall be recognized to a corporation if such corporation is a party to a reorganization and exchanges property, in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, solely for stock or securities in another corporation a party to the reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exchanges not solely in kind</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Gain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If subsection (a) would apply to an exchange but for the fact that the property received in exchange consists not only of stock or securities permitted by subsection (a) to be received without the recognition of gain, but also of other property or money, then&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Property distributed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the corporation receiving such other property or money distributes it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, no gain to the corporation shall be recognized from the exchange, but</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Property not distributed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the corporation receiving such other property or money does not distribute it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, the gain, if any, to the corporation shall be recognized.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The amount of gain recognized under subparagraph (B) shall not exceed the sum of the money and the fair market value of the other property so received which is not so distributed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If subsection (a) would apply to an exchange but for the fact that the property received in exchange consists not only of property permitted by subsection (a) to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, but also of other property or money, then no loss from the exchange shall be recognized.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of transfers to creditors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), any transfer of the other property or money received in the exchange by the corporation to its creditors in connection with the reorganization shall be treated as a distribution in pursuance of the plan of reorganization. The Secretary may prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to prevent avoidance of tax through abuse of the preceding sentence or subsection (c)(3). In the case of a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D) with respect to which stock or securities of the corporation to which the assets are transferred are distributed in a transaction which qualifies under section 355, this paragraph shall apply only to the extent that the sum of the money and the fair market value of other property transferred to such creditors does not exceed the adjusted bases of such assets transferred (reduced by the amount of the liabilities assumed (within the meaning of section 357(c))).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Treatment of distributions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), no gain or loss shall be recognized to a corporation a party to a reorganization on the distribution to its shareholders of property in pursuance of the plan of reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Distributions of appreciated property</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1009 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in a distribution referred to in paragraph (1), the corporation distributes property other than qualified property, and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then gain shall be recognized to the distributing corporation as if such property were sold to the distributee at its fair market value.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Qualified property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;qualified property&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any stock in (or right to acquire stock in) the distributing corporation or obligation of the distributing corporation, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any stock in (or right to acquire stock in) another corporation which is a party to the reorganization or obligation of another corporation which is such a party if such stock (or right) or obligation is received by the distributing corporation in the exchange.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Treatment of liabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If any property distributed in the distribution referred to in paragraph (1) is subject to a liability or the shareholder assumes a liability of the distributing corporation in connection with the distribution, then, for purposes of subparagraph (A), the fair market value of such property shall be treated as not less than the amount of such liability.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of certain transfers to creditors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, any transfer of qualified property by the corporation to its creditors in connection with the reorganization shall be treated as a distribution to its shareholders pursuant to the plan of reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Coordination with other provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Section 311 and subpart B of part II of this subchapter shall not apply to any distribution referred to in paragraph (1).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Amounts received treated as ordinary income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this chapter, any amount included in gross income by reason of this subsection shall be treated as ordinary income. For purposes of applying section 904(d), any such amount shall be treated in the same manner as if such amount were a royalty.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulations relating to transfers of intangibles to partnerships</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may provide by regulations that the rules of paragraph (2) also apply to the transfer of intangible property by a United States person to a partnership in circumstances consistent with the purposes of this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Reorganization</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of parts I and II and this part, the term &ldquo;reorganization&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a statutory merger or consolidation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the acquisition by one corporation, in exchange solely for all or a part of its voting stock (or in exchange solely for all or a part of the voting stock of a corporation which is in control of the acquiring corporation), of stock of another corporation if, immediately after the acquisition, the acquiring corporation has control of such other corporation (whether or not such acquiring corporation had control immediately before the acquisition);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the acquisition by one corporation, in exchange solely for all or a part of its voting stock (or in exchange solely for all or a part of the voting stock of a corporation which is in control of the acquiring corporation), of substantially all of the properties of another corporation, but in determining whether the exchange is solely for stock the assumption by the acquiring corporation of a liability of the other shall be disregarded;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a transfer by a corporation of all or a part of its assets to another corporation if immediately after the transfer the transferor, or one or more of its shareholders (including persons who were shareholders immediately before the transfer), or any combination thereof, is in control of the corporation to which the assets are transferred; but only if, in pursuance of the plan, stock or securities of the corporation to which the assets are transferred are distributed in a transaction which qualifies under section 354, 355, or 356;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) a recapitalization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) a mere change in identity, form, or place of organization of one corporation, however effected; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) a transfer by a corporation of all or part of its assets to another corporation in a title 11 or similar case; but only if, in pursuance of the plan, stock or securities of the corporation to which the assets are transferred are distributed in a transaction which qualifies under section 354, 355, or 356.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rules relating to paragraph (1)</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Reorganizations described in both paragraph (1)(C) and paragraph (1)(D)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a transaction is described in both paragraph (1)(C) and paragraph (1)(D), then, for purposes of this subchapter (other than for purposes of subparagraph (C)), such transaction shall be treated as described only in paragraph (1)(D).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional consideration in certain paragraph (1)(C) cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) one corporation acquires substantially all of the properties of another corporation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the acquisition would qualify under paragraph (1)(C) but for the fact that the acquiring corporation exchanges money or other property in addition to voting stock, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the acquiring corporation acquires, solely for voting stock described in paragraph (1)(C), property of the other corporation having a fair market value which is at least 80 percent of the fair market value of all of the property of the other corporation,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then such acquisition shall (subject to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph) be treated as qualifying under paragraph (1)(C). Solely for the purpose of determining whether clause (iii) of the preceding sentence applies, the amount of any liability assumed by the acquiring corporation shall be treated as money paid for the property.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Transfers of assets or stock to subsidiaries in certain paragraph (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(C), and (1)(G) cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A transaction otherwise qualifying under paragraph (1)(A), (1)(B), or (1)(C) shall not be disqualified by reason of the fact that part or all of the assets or stock which were acquired in the transaction are transferred to a corporation controlled by the corporation <!-- PDFPage:1016 -->acquiring such assets or stock. A similar rule shall apply to a transaction otherwise qualifying under paragraph (1)(G) where the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 354(b)(1) are met with respect to the acquisition of the assets.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Use of stock of controlling corporation in paragraph (1)(A) and (1)(G) cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The acquisition by one corporation, in exchange for stock of a corporation (referred to in this subparagraph as &ldquo;controlling corporation&rdquo;) which is in control of the acquiring corporation, of substantially all of the properties of another corporation shall not disqualify a transaction under paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(G) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) no stock of the acquiring corporation is used in the transaction, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a transaction under paragraph (1)(A), such transaction would have qualified under paragraph (1)(A) had the merger been into the controlling corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Statutory merger using voting stock of corporation controlling merged corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A transaction otherwise qualifying under paragraph (1)(A) shall not be disqualified by reason of the fact that stock of a corporation (referred to in this subparagraph as the &ldquo;controlling corporation&rdquo;) which before the merger was in control of the merged corporation is used in the transaction, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) after the transaction, the corporation surviving the merger holds substantially all of its properties and of the properties of the merged corporation (other than stock of the controlling corporation distributed in the transaction); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the transaction, former shareholders of the surviving corporation exchanged, for an amount of voting stock of the controlling corporation, an amount of stock in the surviving corporation which constitutes control of such corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Certain transactions involving 2 or more investment companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) If immediately before a transaction described in paragraph (1) (other than subparagraph (E) thereof), 2 or more parties to the transaction were investment companies, then the transaction shall not be considered to be a reorganization with respect to any such investment company (and its shareholders and security holders) unless it was a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, or a corporation which meets the requirements of clause (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) A corporation meets the requirements of this clause if not more than 25 percent of the value of its total assets is invested in the stock and securities of any one issuer, and not more than 50 percent of the value of its total assets is invested in the stock and securities of 5 or fewer issuers. For purposes of this clause, all members of a controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1563(a)) shall be treated as one issuer. For purposes of this clause, a person holding stock in a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, or an investment company which meets the requirements of this clause shall, except as provided in regulations, be treated as holding its proportionate share of the assets held by such company or trust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) For purposes of this subparagraph the term &ldquo;investment company&rdquo; means a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, or a corporation 50 percent or more of the value of whose total assets are stock and securities and 80 percent or more of the value of whose total assets are assets held for investment. In making the 50-percent and 80-percent determinations under the preceding sentence, stock and securities in any subsidiary corporation shall be disregarded and the parent corporation shall be deemed to own its ratable share of the subsidiary's assets, and a corporation shall be considered a subsidiary if the parent owns 50 percent or more of the combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or 50 percent or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock outstanding.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to prescribe regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to determine whether an interest in a corporation is to be treated for purposes of this title as stock or indebtedness (or as in part stock and in part indebtedness).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The regulations prescribed under this section shall set forth factors which are to be taken into account in determining with respect to a particular factual situation whether a debtor-creditor relationship exists or a corporation-shareholder relationship exists. The factors so set forth in the regulations may include among other factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) whether there is a written unconditional promise to pay on demand or on a specified date a sum certain in money in return for an adequate consideration in money or money's worth, and to pay a fixed rate of interest,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) whether there is subordination to or preference over any indebtedness of the corporation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the ratio of debt to equity of the corporation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) whether there is convertibility into the stock of the corporation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the relationship between holdings of stock in the corporation and holdings of the interest in question.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Effect of classification by issuer</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The characterization (as of the time of issuance) by the issuer as to whether an interest in a corporation is stock or indebtedness shall be binding on such issuer and on all holders of such interest (but shall not be binding on the Secretary).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notification of inconsistent treatment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in regulations, paragraph (1) shall not apply to any holder of an interest if such holder on his return discloses that he is treating such interest in a manner inconsistent with the characterization referred to in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulations</h4>
