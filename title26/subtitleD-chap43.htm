<h4 class="note-head">Intent of Congress Concerning Employee Stock Ownership Plans</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 803(h) of Pub. L. 94&ndash;455 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress, in a series of laws (the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Trade Act of 1974, and the Tax Reduction Act of 1975) and this Act has made clear its interest in encouraging employee stock ownership plans as a bold and innovative method of strengthening the free private enterprise system which will solve the dual problems of securing capital funds for necessary capital growth and of bringing about stock ownership by all corporate employees. The Congress is deeply concerned that the objectives sought by this series of laws will be made unattainable by regulations and rulings which treat employee stock ownership plans as conventional retirement plans, which reduce the freedom of the employee trusts and employers to take the necessary steps to implement the plans, and which otherwise block the establishment and success of these plans. Because of the special purposes for which employee stock ownership plans are established, it is consistent with the intent of Congress to permit these plans (whether structured as pension, stock bonus, or profit-sharing plans) to distribute income on employer securities currently.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) in the case of any plan, by reason of the failure of the plan to initially qualify or the failure of contributions to be deductible.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exception for employee stock ownership plans</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, upon an employer reversion from a qualified plan, any applicable amount is transferred from such plan to an employee stock ownership plan described in section 4975(e)(7) or a tax credit employee stock ownership plan (as described in section 409), such amount shall not be treated as an employer reversion for purposes of this section (or includible in the gross income of the employer) if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The requirements of this subparagraph are met if, within 90 days after the transfer (or such longer period as the Secretary may prescribe), the amount transferred is invested in employer securities (as defined in section 409(<em>l</em>)) or used to repay loans used to purchase such securities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Allocation requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The requirements of this subparagraph are met if the portion of the amount transferred which is not allocated under the plan to accounts of participants in the plan year in which the transfer occurs&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) when allocated to accounts of participants under the plan, is treated as an employer contribution for purposes of section 415(c), except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the annual addition (as determined under section 415(c)) attributable to each such allocation shall not exceed the value of such securities as of the time such securities were credited to such suspense account, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) no additional employer contributions shall be permitted to an employee stock ownership plan described in subparagraph (A) of the employer before the allocation of such amount.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The amount allocated in the year of transfer shall not be less than the lesser of the maximum amount allowable under section 415 or 1/8 of the amount attributable to the securities acquired. In the case of dividends on securities held in the suspense account, the requirements of this subparagraph are met only if the dividends are allocated to accounts of participants or paid to participants in proportion to their accounts, or used to repay loans used to purchase employer securities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Participants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The requirements of this subparagraph are met if at least half of the participants in the qualified plan are participants in the employee stock ownership plan (as of the close of the 1st plan year for which an allocation of the securities is required).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Applicable amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;applicable amount&rdquo; means any amount which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is transferred after March 31, 1985, and before January 1, 1989, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is transferred after December 31, 1988, pursuant to a termination which occurs after March 31, 1985, and before January 1, 1989.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) No credit or deduction allowed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No credit or deduction shall be allowed under chapter 1 for any amount transferred to an employee stock ownership plan in a transfer to which this paragraph applies.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Amount transferred to include income thereon, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount transferred shall not be treated as meeting the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (C) unless amounts attributable to such amount also meet such requirements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Time for payment of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subtitle F, the time for payment of the tax imposed by subsection (a) shall be the last day of the month following the month in which the employer reversion occurs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Increase in tax for failure to establish replacement plan or increase benefits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (a) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;50 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;20 percent&rdquo; with respect to any employer reversion from a qualified plan unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the employer establishes or maintains a qualified replacement plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the plan provides benefit increases meeting the requirements of paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Qualified replacement plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;qualified replacement plan&rdquo; means a qualified plan established or maintained by the employer in connection with a qualified plan termination (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;replacement plan&rdquo;) with respect to which the following requirements are met:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the amount determined under clause (ii).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Reduction for increase in benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The amount determined under this clause is an amount equal to the present value of the aggregate increases in the accrued benefits under the terminated plan of any participants or beneficiaries pursuant to a plan amendment which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is adopted during the 60-day period ending on the date of termination of the qualified plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) takes effect immediately on the termination date.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Treatment of amount transferred</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of the transfer of any amount under clause (i)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) such amount shall not be includible in the gross income of the employer,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) no deduction shall be allowable with respect to such transfer, and</p>
