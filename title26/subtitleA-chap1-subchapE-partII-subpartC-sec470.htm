<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the aggregate income from such property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Tax-exempt use property</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;tax-exempt use property&rdquo; has the meaning given to such term by section 168(h), except that such section shall be applied&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) without regard to paragraphs (1)(C) and (3) thereof, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) as if section 197 intangible property (as defined in section 197), and property described in paragraph (1)(B) or (2) of section 167(f), were tangible property.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception for partnerships</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such term shall not include any property which would (but for this subparagraph) be tax-exempt use property solely by reason of section 168(h)(6).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Cross reference</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>For treatment of partnerships as leases to which section 168(h) applies, see section 7701(e).</strong></p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exception for certain leases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not apply to any lease of property which meets the requirements of all of the following paragraphs:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1439 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Availability of funds</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A lease of property meets the requirements of this paragraph if (at all times during the lease term) not more than an allowable amount of funds are&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) set aside or expected to be set aside,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">to or for the benefit of the lessor or any lender, or to or for the benefit of the lessee to satisfy the lessee's obligations or options under the lease. For purposes of clause (ii), funds shall be treated as set aside or expected to be set aside only if a reasonable person would conclude, based on the facts and circumstances, that such funds are set aside or expected to be set aside.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Arrangements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The arrangements referred to in this subparagraph include a defeasance arrangement, a loan by the lessee to the lessor or any lender, a deposit arrangement, a letter of credit collateralized with cash or cash equivalents, a payment undertaking agreement, prepaid rent (within the meaning of the regulations under section 467), a sinking fund arrangement, a guaranteed investment contract, financial guaranty insurance, and any similar arrangement (whether or not such arrangement provides credit support).</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Higher amount permitted in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">To the extent provided in regulations, a higher percentage shall be permitted under clause (i) where necessary because of the credit-worthiness of the lessee. In no event may such regulations permit a percentage of more than 50 percent.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Option to purchase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If under the lease the lessee has the option to purchase the property for a fixed price or for other than the fair market value of the property (determined at the time of exercise), the allowable amount at the time such option may be exercised may not exceed 50 percent of the price at which such option may be exercised.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) No allowable amount for certain arrangements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The allowable amount shall be zero with respect to any arrangement which involves&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) any deposit received, letter of credit issued, or payment undertaking agreement entered into by a lender otherwise involved in the transaction, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) in the case of a transaction which involves a lender, any credit support made available to the lessor in which any such lender does not have a claim that is senior to the lessor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;For purposes of subclause (I), the term &ldquo;loan&rdquo; shall not include any amount treated as a loan under section 467 with respect to a section 467 rental agreement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) has at the time the lease is entered into an unconditional at-risk equity investment (as determined by the Secretary) in the property of at least 20 percent of the lessor's adjusted basis in the property as of that time, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) maintains such investment throughout the term of the lease, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the fair market value of the property at the end of the lease term is reasonably expected to be equal to at least 20 percent of such basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Risk of loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of clause (ii),<sup><a href="#470_1_target" name="470_1">1</a></sup> the fair market value at the end of the lease term shall be reduced to the extent that a person other than the lessor bears a risk of loss in the value of the property.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Paragraph not to apply to short-term leases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This paragraph shall not apply to any lease with a lease term of 5 years or less.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Lessee may not bear more than minimal risk of loss</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A lease of property meets the requirements of this paragraph if there is no arrangement under which the lessee bears&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any portion of the loss that would occur if the fair market value of the leased property were 25 percent less than its reasonably expected fair market value at the time the lease is terminated, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) more than 50 percent of the loss that would occur if the fair market value of the leased property at the time the lease is terminated were zero.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may by regulations provide that the requirements of this paragraph are not met where the lessee bears more than a minimal risk of loss.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Paragraph not to apply to short-term leases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This paragraph shall not apply to any lease with a lease term of 5 years or less.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) under which the lessee has the option to purchase the property,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the lease meets the requirements of this paragraph only if the purchase price under the option equals the fair market value of the property (determined at the time of exercise).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Treatment of former tax-exempt use property</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any former tax-exempt use property&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any deduction allowable under subsection (b) with respect to such property for any taxable year shall be allowed only to the extent of any net income (without regard to such deduction) from such property for such taxable year, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the exchanged or converted property is tax-exempt use property subject to a lease which was entered into before March 13, 2004, and which would not have met the requirements of subsection (d) had such requirements been in effect when the lease was entered into, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the replacement property is tax-exempt use property subject to a lease which does not meet the requirements of subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjusted basis</h4>
