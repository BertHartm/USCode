<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Inflation adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 1990, the $40,000 and $60,000 amounts contained in subparagraph (A) shall be increased by an amount equal to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the cost-of-living adjustment under section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins, determined by substituting &ldquo;calendar year 1989&rdquo; for &ldquo;calendar year 1992&rdquo; in subparagraph (B) thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Rounding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If any amount as adjusted under subparagraph (B) is not a multiple of $50, such amount shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $50 (or if such amount is a multiple of $25, such amount shall be rounded to the next highest multiple of $50).</p>
