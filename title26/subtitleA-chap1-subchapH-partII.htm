<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment of reserves</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each taxpayer described in subsection (a) which uses the reserve method of accounting for bad debts shall establish and maintain a reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans, a reserve for losses on nonqualifying loans, and a supplemental reserve for losses on loans. For purposes of this title, such reserves shall be treated as reserves for bad debts, but no deduction shall be allowed for any addition to the supplemental reserve for losses on loans.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain pre-1963 reserves</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the second sentence of paragraph (1), any amount allocated pursuant to paragraph (5) (as in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1976) during a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1977, to the reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans out of the surplus, undivided profits, and bad debt reserves (determined as of December 31, 1962) attributable to the period before the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1951, shall not be treated as a reserve for bad debts for any purpose other than determining the amount referred to in subsection (b)(1)(B), and for such purpose such amount shall be treated as remaining in such reserve.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Charging of bad debts to reserves</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any debt becoming worthless or partially worthless in respect of a qualifying real property loan shall be charged to the reserve for losses on such loans, and any debt becoming worthless or partially worthless in respect of a nonqualifying loan shall be charged to the reserve for losses on nonqualifying loans; except that any such debt may, at the election of the taxpayer, be charged in whole or in part to the supplemental reserve for losses on loans.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Loans defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Qualifying real property loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;qualifying real property loan&rdquo; means any loan secured by an interest in improved real property or secured by an interest in real property which is to be improved out of the proceeds of the loan, but such term does not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any loan evidenced by a security (as defined in section 165(g)(2)(C));</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any loan, whether or not evidenced by a security (as defined in section 165(g)(2)(C)), the primary obligor on which is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a government or political subdivision or instrumentality thereof;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a bank (as defined in section 581); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) another member of the same affiliated group;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any loan, to the extent secured by a deposit in or share of the taxpayer; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any loan which, within a 60-day period beginning in one taxable year of the creditor and ending in its next taxable year, is made or acquired and then repaid or disposed of, unless the transactions by which such loan was made or acquired and then repaid or disposed of are established to be for bona fide business purposes. For purposes of subparagraph (B)(iii), the term &ldquo;affiliated group&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to such term by section 1504(a); except that (i) the phrase &ldquo;more than 50 percent&rdquo; shall be substituted for the phrase &ldquo;at least 80 percent&rdquo; each place it appears in section 1504(a), and (ii) all corporations shall be treated as includible corporations (without any exclusion under section 1504(b)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Nonqualifying loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;nonqualifying loan&rdquo; means any loan which is not a qualifying real property loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Loan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;loan&rdquo; means debt, as the term &ldquo;debt&rdquo; is used in section 166.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of interests in REMIC's</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A regular or residual interest in a REMIC shall be treated as a qualifying real property loan; except that, if less than 95 percent of the <!-- PDFPage:1568 -->assets of such REMIC are qualifying real property loans (determined as if the taxpayer held the assets of the REMIC), such interest shall be so treated only in the proportion which the assets of such REMIC consist of such loans. For purposes of determining whether any interest in a REMIC qualifies under the preceding sentence, any interest in another REMIC held by such REMIC shall be treated as a qualifying real property loan under principles similar to the principles of the preceding sentence, except that if such REMIC's are part of a tiered structure, they shall be treated as 1 REMIC for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Distributions to shareholders</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this chapter, any distribution of property (as defined in section 317(a)) by a taxpayer having a balance described in subsection (g)(2)(A)(ii) to a shareholder with respect to its stock, if such distribution is not allowable as a deduction under section 591, shall be treated as made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) first out of its earnings and profits accumulated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1951, (and, in the case of an S corporation, the accumulated adjustments account, as defined in section 1368(e)(1)) to the extent thereof,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) then out of the balance taken into account under subsection (g)(2)(A)(ii) (properly adjusted for amounts charged against such reserves for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1987),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) then out of the supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the extent thereof,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) then out of such other accounts as may be proper.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">This paragraph shall apply in the case of any distribution in redemption of stock or in partial or complete liquidation of a taxpayer having a balance described in subsection (g)(2)(A)(ii), except that any such distribution shall be treated as made first out of the amount referred to in subparagraph (B), second out of the amount referred to in subparagraph (C), third out of the amount referred to in subparagraph (A), and then out of such other accounts as may be proper. This paragraph shall not apply to any transaction to which section 381 applies, or to any distribution to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (or any successor thereof) or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in redemption of an interest in a taxpayer having a balance described in subsection (g)(2)(A)(ii), if such interest was originally received by any such entity in exchange for assistance provided under a provision of law referred to in section 597(c). This paragraph shall not apply to any distribution of all of the stock of a bank (as defined in section 581) to another corporation if, immediately after the distribution, such bank and such other corporation are members of the same affiliated group (as defined in section 1504) and the provisions of section 5(e) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (as in effect on December 31, 1995) or similar provisions are in effect.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amounts charged to reserve accounts and included in gross income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any distribution is treated under paragraph (1) as having been made out of the reserves described in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of such paragraph, the amount charged against such reserve shall be the amount which, when reduced by the amount of tax imposed under this chapter and attributable to the inclusion of such amount in gross income, is equal to the amount of such distribution; and the amount so charged against such reserve shall be included in gross income of the taxpayer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), additions to the reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans for the taxable year in which the distribution occurs shall be taken into account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of computing under this section the amount of a reasonable addition to the reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans for any taxable year, any amount charged during any year to such reserve pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (2) shall not be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Termination of reserve method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) shall not apply to any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1995.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) 6-year spread of adjustments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any taxpayer who is required by reason of subsection (f) to change its method of computing reserves for bad debts&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such change shall be treated as a change in a method of accounting,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such change shall be treated as initiated by the taxpayer and as having been made with the consent of the Secretary, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the net amount of the adjustments required to be taken into account by the taxpayer under section 481(a)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall be determined by taking into account only applicable excess reserves, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) as so determined, shall be taken into account ratably over the 6-taxable year period beginning with the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1995.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Applicable excess reserves</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;applicable excess reserves&rdquo; means the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the balance of the reserves described in subsection (c)(1) (other than the supplemental reserve) as of the close of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 1996, over</p>
