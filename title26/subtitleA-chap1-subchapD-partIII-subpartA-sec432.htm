<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a plan which is in a funding improvement or rehabilitation period, whether or not the plan is making the scheduled progress in meeting the requirements of its funding improvement or rehabilitation plan.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Actuarial projections of assets and liabilities</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In making the determinations and projections under this subsection, the plan actuary shall make projections required for the current and succeeding plan years of the current value of the assets of the plan and the present value of all liabilities to participants and beneficiaries under the plan for the current plan year as of the beginning of such year. The actuary's projections shall be based on reasonable actuarial estimates, assumptions, and methods that, except as provided in clause (iii), offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan. The projected present value of liabilities as of the beginning of such year shall be determined based on the most recent of either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the actuarial statement required under section 103(d) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 with respect to the most recently filed annual report, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the actuarial valuation for the preceding plan year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any actuarial projection of plan assets shall assume&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) reasonably anticipated employer contributions for the current and succeeding plan years, assuming that the terms of the one or more collective bargaining agreements pursuant to which the plan is maintained for the current plan year continue in effect for succeeding plan years, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) that employer contributions for the most recent plan year will continue indefinitely, but only if the plan actuary determines there have been no significant demographic changes that would make such assumption unreasonable.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Projected industry activity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any projection of activity in the industry or industries covered by the plan, including future covered employment and contribution levels, shall be based on information provided by the plan sponsor, which shall act reasonably and in good faith.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Penalty for failure to secure timely actuarial certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any failure of the plan's actuary to certify the plan's status under this subsection by the date specified in subparagraph (A) shall be treated for purposes of section 502(c)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as a failure or refusal by the plan administrator to file the annual report required to be filed with the Secretary under section 101(b)(1) of such Act.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Notice</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In any case in which it is certified under subparagraph (A) that a multiemployer <!-- PDFPage:1297 -->plan is or will be in endangered or critical status for a plan year, the plan sponsor shall, not later than 30 days after the date of the certification, provide notification of the endangered or critical status to the participants and beneficiaries, the bargaining parties, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and the Secretary of Labor.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Plans in critical status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If it is certified under subparagraph (A) that a multiemployer plan is or will be in critical status, the plan sponsor shall include in the notice under clause (i) an explanation of the possibility that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) adjustable benefits (as defined in subsection (e)(8)) may be reduced, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) such reductions may apply to participants and beneficiaries whose benefit commencement date is on or after the date such notice is provided for the first plan year in which the plan is in critical status.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Model notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor&nbsp;<sup><a href="#432_1_target" name="432_1">1</a></sup> shall prescribe a model notice that a multiemployer plan may use to satisfy the requirements under clause (ii).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Funding improvement plan must be adopted for multiemployer plans in endangered status</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which a multiemployer plan is in endangered status for a plan year, the plan sponsor, in accordance with this subsection&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) one proposal for reductions in the amount of future benefit accruals necessary to achieve the applicable benchmarks, assuming no amendments increasing contributions under the plan (other than amendments increasing contributions necessary to achieve the applicable benchmarks after amendments have reduced future benefit accruals to the maximum extent permitted by law), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) one proposal for increases in contributions under the plan necessary to achieve the applicable benchmarks, assuming no amendments reducing future benefit accruals under the plan, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) may, if the plan sponsor deems appropriate, prepare and provide the bargaining parties with additional information relating to contribution rates or benefit reductions, alternative schedules, or other information relevant to achieving the applicable benchmarks in accordance with the funding improvement plan.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception for years after process begins</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a plan year if such year is in a funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period by reason of the plan being in endangered status for a preceding plan year.

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Plans in critical status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the plan's actuary certifies under subsection (b)(3)(A) for a plan year in any funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period that the plan is in critical status, the funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period, whichever is applicable, shall end as of the close of the plan year preceding the first plan year in the rehabilitation period with respect to such status.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Plans in endangered status at end of period</h4>
