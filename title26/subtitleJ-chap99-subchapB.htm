<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this chapter&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The health benefit premium for any plan year for any assigned operator shall be an amount equal to the product of the per beneficiary premium for the plan year multiplied by the number of eligible beneficiaries assigned to such operator under section 9706.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Per beneficiary premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commissioner of Social Security shall calculate a per beneficiary premium for each plan year beginning on or after February 1, 1993, which is equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount determined by dividing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the aggregate amount of payments from the 1950 UMWA Benefit Plan and the 1974 UMWA Benefit Plan for health benefits (less reimbursements but including administrative costs) for the plan year beginning July 1, 1991, for all individuals covered under such plans for such plan year, by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the number of such individuals, plus</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adjustments for medicare reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, by reason of a reduction in benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act, the level of health benefits under the Combined Fund would be reduced, the trustees of the Combined Fund shall increase the per beneficiary premium for the plan year in which the reduction occurs and each subsequent plan year by the amount necessary to maintain the level of health benefits which would have been provided without such reduction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Death benefit premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The death benefit premium for any plan year for any assigned operator shall be equal to the applicable percentage of the amount, actuarially determined, which the Combined Fund will be required to pay during the plan year for death benefits coverage described in section 9703(c).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Unassigned beneficiaries premium</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Plan years ending on or before September 30, 2006</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For plan years ending on or before September 30, 2006, the unassigned beneficiaries premium for any assigned operator shall be equal to the applicable percentage of the product of the per beneficiary premium for the plan year multiplied by the number of eligible beneficiaries who are not assigned under section 9706 to any person for such plan year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Plan years beginning on or after October 1, 2006</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For plan years beginning on or after October 1, 2006, subject to subparagraph (B), there shall be no unassigned beneficiaries premium, and benefit costs with respect to eligible beneficiaries who are not assigned under section 9706 to any person for any such plan year shall be paid from amounts transferred under section 9705(b).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Inadequate transfers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, for any plan year beginning on or after October 1, 2006, the amounts transferred under section 9705(b) are less than the amounts required to be transferred to the Combined Fund under subsection (h)(2)(A) or (i) of section 402 of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1232)),<sup><a href="#9704_1_target" name="9704_1">1</a></sup> then the unassigned beneficiaries premium for any assigned operator shall be equal to the operator's applicable percentage of the amount required to be so transferred which was not so transferred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Premium accounts; adjustments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The trustees of the Combined Fund shall establish and maintain 3 separate accounts for each of the premiums described in subsections (b), (c), and (d). Such accounts shall be credited with the premiums received and amounts transferred under section 9705(b) and debited with expenditures allocable to such premiums.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allocations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Administrative expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Administrative costs for any plan year shall be allocated to premium accounts under paragraph (1) on the basis of expenditures (other than administrative costs) from such accounts during the preceding plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Interest shall be allocated to the account established for health benefit premiums.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3806 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Shortfalls and surpluses</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), if, for any plan year, there is a shortfall or surplus in any premium account, the premium for the following plan year for each assigned operator shall be proportionately reduced or increased, whichever is applicable, by the amount of such shortfall or surplus. Amounts credited to an account from amounts transferred under section 9705(b) shall not be taken into account in determining whether there is a surplus in the account for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any surplus in the health benefit premium account or the unassigned beneficiaries premium account which is attributable to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the excess of the premiums credited to such account for a plan year over the benefits (and administrative costs) debited to such account for the plan year, but such excess shall only be available for purposes of the carryover described in section 9703(b)(2)(C)(ii) (relating to carryovers of premiums not used to provide benefits), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) interest credited under paragraph (2)(B) for the plan year or any preceding plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) No authority for increased payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to allow expenditures for health care benefits for any plan year in excess of the limit under section 9703(b)(2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Applicable percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;applicable percentage&rdquo; means, with respect to any assigned operator, the percentage determined by dividing the number of eligible beneficiaries assigned under section 9706 to such operator by the total number of eligible beneficiaries assigned under section 9706 to all such operators (determined on the basis of assignments as of October 1, 1993).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any plan year beginning on or after October 1, 1994, the applicable percentage for any assigned operator shall be redetermined under paragraph (1) by making the following changes to the assignments as of October 1, 1993:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Such assignments shall be modified to reflect any changes during the period beginning October 1, 1993, and ending on the last day of the preceding plan year pursuant to the appeals process under section 9706(f).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The total number of assigned eligible beneficiaries shall be reduced by the eligible beneficiaries of assigned operators which (and all related persons with respect to which) had ceased business (within the meaning of section 9701(c)(6)) during the period described in subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) In the case of plan years beginning on or after October 1, 2007, the total number of assigned eligible beneficiaries shall be reduced by the eligible beneficiaries whose assignments have been revoked under section 9706(h).</p>
