<p class="italic-text-para">.02 Unearned Income of Minor Children Taxed as if Parent's Income (the &ldquo;Kiddie Tax&rdquo;). For taxable years beginning in 2004, the amount in &sect;1(g)(4)(A)(ii)(I), which is used to reduce the net unearned income reported on the child's return that is subject to the &ldquo;kiddie tax,&rdquo; is $800. (This amount is the same as the $800 standard deduction amount provided in section 3.10(2) of this revenue procedure.) The same $800 amount is used for purposes of &sect;1(g)(7) (that is, in determining whether a parent may elect to include a child's gross income in the parent's gross income and for calculating the &ldquo;kiddie tax&rdquo;). For example, one of the requirements for the parental election is that a child's gross income is more than the amount referenced in &sect;1(g)(4)(A)(ii)(I) but less than 10 times such amount; thus, a child's gross income for 2004 must be more than $800 but less than $8,000 to satisfy that requirement.</p>
