<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Certain revocable and irrevocable trusts</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;674. Power to control beneficial enjoyment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The grantor shall be treated as the owner of any portion of a trust in respect of which the beneficial enjoyment of the corpus or the income therefrom is subject to a power of disposition, exercisable by the grantor or a nonadverse party, or both, without the approval or consent of any adverse party.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exceptions for certain powers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) shall not apply to the following powers regardless of by whom held:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Power to apply income to support of a dependent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A power described in section 677(b) to the extent that the grantor would not be subject to tax under that section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Power affecting beneficial enjoyment only after occurrence of event</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A power, the exercise of which can only affect the beneficial enjoyment of the income for a period commencing after the occurrence of an event such that a grantor would not be treated as the owner under section 673 if the power were a reversionary interest; but the grantor may be treated as the owner after the occurrence of the event unless the power is relinquished.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Power exercisable only by will</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A power exercisable only by will, other than a power in the grantor to appoint by will the income of the trust where the income is accumulated for such disposition by the grantor or may be so accumulated in the discretion of the grantor or a nonadverse party, or both, without the approval or consent of any adverse party.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Power to allocate among charitable beneficiaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A power to determine the beneficial enjoyment of the corpus or the income therefrom if the corpus or income is irrevocably payable for a purpose specified in section 170(c) (relating to definition of charitable contributions) or to an employee stock ownership plan (as defined in section 4975(e)(7)) in a qualified gratuitous transfer (as defined in section 664(g)(1)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Power to distribute corpus</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A power to distribute corpus either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to or for a beneficiary or beneficiaries or to or for a class of beneficiaries (whether or not income beneficiaries) provided that the power is limited by a reasonably definite standard which is set forth in the trust instrument; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to or for any current income beneficiary, provided that the distribution of corpus must be chargeable against the proportionate share of corpus held in trust for the payment of income to the beneficiary as if the corpus constituted a separate trust.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A power does not fall within the powers described in this paragraph if any person has a <!-- PDFPage:1432 -->power to add to the beneficiary or beneficiaries or to a class of beneficiaries designated to receive the income or corpus, except where such action is to provide for after-born or after-adopted children.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Power to withhold income temporarily</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A power to distribute or apply income to or for any current income beneficiary or to accumulate the income for him, provided that any accumulated income must ultimately be payable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to the beneficiary from whom distribution or application is withheld, to his estate, or to his appointees (or persons named as alternate takers in default of appointment) provided that such beneficiary possesses a power of appointment which does not exclude from the class of possible appointees any person other than the beneficiary, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on termination of the trust, or in conjunction with a distribution of corpus which is augmented by such accumulated income, to the current income beneficiaries in shares which have been irrevocably specified in the trust instrument.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Accumulated income shall be considered so payable although it is provided that if any beneficiary does not survive a date of distribution which could reasonably have been expected to occur within the beneficiary's lifetime, the share of the deceased beneficiary is to be paid to his appointees or to one or more designated alternate takers (other than the grantor or the grantor's estate) whose shares have been irrevocably specified. A power does not fall within the powers described in this paragraph if any person has a power to add to the beneficiary or beneficiaries or to a class of beneficiaries designated to receive the income or corpus except where such action is to provide for after-born or after-adopted children.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Power to withhold income during disability of a beneficiary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A power exercisable only during&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the existence of a legal disability of any current income beneficiary, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the period during which any income beneficiary shall be under the age of 21 years,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">to distribute or apply income to or for such beneficiary or to accumulate and add the income to corpus. A power does not fall within the powers described in this paragraph if any person has a power to add to the beneficiary or beneficiaries or to a class of beneficiaries designated to receive the income or corpus, except where such action is to provide for after-born or after-adopted children.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Power to allocate between corpus and income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A power to allocate receipts and disbursements as between corpus and income, even though expressed in broad language.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exception for certain powers of independent trustees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) shall not apply to a power solely exercisable (without the approval or consent of any other person) by a trustee or trustees, none of whom is the grantor, and no more than half of whom are related or subordinate parties who are subservient to the wishes of the grantor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to distribute, apportion, or accumulate income to or for a beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to, for, or within a class of beneficiaries; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to pay out corpus to or for a beneficiary or beneficiaries or to or for a class of beneficiaries (whether or not income beneficiaries).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A power does not fall within the powers described in this subsection if any person has a power to add to the beneficiary or beneficiaries or to a class of beneficiaries designated to receive the income or corpus, except where such action is to provide for after-born or after-adopted children. For periods during which an individual is the spouse of the grantor (within the meaning of section 672(e)(2)), any reference in this subsection to the grantor shall be treated as including a reference to such individual.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Power to allocate income if limited by a standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) shall not apply to a power solely exercisable (without the approval or consent of any other person) by a trustee or trustees, none of whom is the grantor or spouse living with the grantor, to distribute, apportion, or accumulate income to or for a beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to, for, or within a class of beneficiaries, whether or not the conditions of paragraph (6) or (7) of subsection (b) are satisfied, if such power is limited by a reasonably definite external standard which is set forth in the trust instrument. A power does not fall within the powers described in this subsection if any person has a power to add to the beneficiary or beneficiaries or to a class of beneficiaries designated to receive the income or corpus except where such action is to provide for after-born or after-adopted children.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A person other than the grantor shall be treated as the owner of any portion of a trust with respect to which:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such person has a power exercisable solely by himself to vest the corpus or the income therefrom in himself, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such person has previously partially released or otherwise modified such a power and after the release or modification retains such control as would, within the principles of sections 671 to 677, inclusive, subject to grantor of a trust to treatment as the owner thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exception where grantor is taxable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to a power over income, as originally granted or thereafter modified, if the grantor of the trust or a transferor (to whom section 679 applies) is otherwise treated as the owner under the provisions of this subpart other than this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Obligations of support</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) shall not apply to a power which enables such person, in the capacity of trustee or cotrustee, merely to apply the income of the trust to the support or maintenance of a person whom the holder of the power is obligated to support or maintain except to the extent that such income is so applied. In cases where the amounts so applied or distributed are paid out of corpus or out of other than income of the taxable year, such amounts shall be considered to be an amount paid or credited within the meaning of paragraph (2) of section 661(a) and shall be taxed to the holder of the power under section 662.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effect of renunciation or disclaimer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to a power which has been renounced or disclaimed within a reasonable time after the holder of the power first became aware of its existence.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Transferor treated as owner</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A United States person who directly or indirectly transfers property to a foreign trust (other than a trust described in section 6048(a)(3)(B)(ii)) shall be treated as the owner for his taxable year of the portion of such trust attributable to such property if for such year there is a United States beneficiary of any portion of such trust.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Transfers by reason of death</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To any transfer by reason of the death of the transferor.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Transfers at fair market value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To any transfer of property to a trust in exchange for consideration of at least the fair market value of the transferred property. For purposes of the preceding sentence, consideration other than cash shall be taken into account at its fair market value.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certain obligations not taken into account under fair market value exception</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining whether paragraph (2)(B) applies to any transfer by a person described in clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (C), there shall not be taken into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) except as provided in regulations, any obligation of a person described in subparagraph (C), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to the extent provided in regulations, any obligation which is guaranteed by a person described in subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of principal payments on obligation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Principal payments by the trust on any obligation referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be taken into account on and after the date of the payment in determining the portion of the trust attributable to the property transferred.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Persons described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The persons described in this subparagraph are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the trust,</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rules applicable to foreign grantor who later becomes a United States person</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a nonresident alien individual has a residency starting date within 5 years after directly or indirectly transferring property to a foreign trust, this section and section 6048 shall be applied as if such individual transferred to such trust on the residency starting date an amount equal to the portion of such trust attributable to the property transferred by such individual to such trust in such transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of undistributed income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section, undistributed net income for periods before such individual's residency starting date shall be taken into account in determining the portion of the trust which is attributable to property transferred by such individual to such trust but shall not otherwise be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Residency starting date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, an individual's residency starting date is the residency starting date determined under section 7701(b)(2)(A).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States transferred property to a trust which was not a foreign trust, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such trust becomes a foreign trust while such individual is alive,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then this section and section 6048 shall be applied as if such individual transferred to such trust on the date such trust becomes a foreign trust an amount equal to the portion of such trust attributable to the property previously transferred by such individual to such trust. A rule similar to the rule of paragraph (4)(B) shall apply for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Trusts acquiring United States beneficiaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) subsection (a) applies to a trust for the transferor's taxable year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) subsection (a) would have applied to the trust for his immediately preceding taxable year but for the fact that for such preceding taxable year there was no United States beneficiary for any portion of the trust,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then, for purposes of this subtitle, the transferor shall be treated as having income for the taxable year (in addition to his other income for such year) equal to the undistributed net income (at the close of such immediately preceding taxable year) attributable to the portion of the trust referred to in subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Trusts treated as having a United States beneficiary</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the trust were terminated at any time during the taxable year, no part of the income or corpus of such trust could be paid to or for the benefit of a United States person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Attribution of ownership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), an amount shall be treated as paid or accumulated to or <!-- PDFPage:1436 -->for the benefit of a United States person if such amount is paid to or accumulated for a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, or foreign trust or estate, and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a foreign corporation, such corporation is a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957(a)),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a foreign partnership, a United States person is a partner of such partnership, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of a foreign trust or estate, such trust or estate has a United States beneficiary (within the meaning of paragraph (1)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certain United States beneficiaries disregarded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A beneficiary shall not be treated as a United States person in applying this section with respect to any transfer of property to foreign trust if such beneficiary first became a United States person more than 5 years after the date of such transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
