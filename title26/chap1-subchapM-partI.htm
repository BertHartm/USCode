<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subtitle, the term &ldquo;regulated investment company&rdquo; means any domestic corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) which, at all times during the taxable year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;1 to 80b&ndash;2) as a management company or unit investment trust, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has in effect an election under such Act to be treated as a business development company, or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) which is a common trust fund or similar fund excluded by section 3(c)(3) of such Act (15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;3(c)) from the definition of &ldquo;investment company&rdquo; and is not included in the definition of &ldquo;common trust fund&rdquo; by section 584(a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A corporation shall not be considered a regulated investment company for any taxable year unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it files with its return for the taxable year an election to be a regulated investment company or has made such election for a previous taxable year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) at least 90 percent of its gross income is derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans (as defined in section 512(a)(5)), and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities (as defined in section 2(a)(36) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended) or foreign currencies, or other income (including but not limited to gains from options, futures, or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities, or currencies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) at the close of each quarter of the taxable year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) at least 50 percent of the value of its total assets is represented by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) cash and cash items (including receivables), Government securities and securities of other regulated investment companies, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) other securities for purposes of this calculation limited, except and to the extent provided in subsection (e), in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater in value than 5 percent of the value of the total assets of the taxpayer and to not more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not more than 25 percent of the value of its total assets is invested in the securities (other than Government securities or <!-- PDFPage:1384 -->the securities of other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer, or of two or more issuers which the taxpayer controls and which are determined, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to be engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of paragraph (2), there shall be treated as dividends amounts included in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A)(i) or 1293(a) for the taxable year to the extent that, under section 959(a)(1) or 1293(c) (as the case may be), there is a distribution out of the earnings and profits of the taxable year which are attributable to the amounts so included. For purposes of paragraph (2), the Secretary may by regulation exclude from qualifying income foreign currency gains which are not directly related to the company's principal business of investing in stock or securities (or options and futures with respect to stock or securities). For purposes of paragraph (2), amounts excludable from gross income under section 103(a) shall be treated as included in gross income. Income derived from a partnership or trust shall be treated as described in paragraph (2) only to the extent such income is attributable to items of income of the partnership or trust (as the case may be) which would be described in paragraph (2) if realized by the regulated investment company in the same manner as realized by the partnership or trust.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rules applicable to subsection (b)(3)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (b)(3) and this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In ascertaining the value of the taxpayer's investment in the securities of an issuer, for the purposes of subparagraph (B), there shall be included its proper proportion of the investment of any other corporation, a member of a controlled group, in the securities of such issuer, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;controls&rdquo; means the ownership in a corporation of 20 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;controlled group&rdquo; means one or more chains of corporations connected through stock ownership with the taxpayer if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 20 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of each of the corporations (except the taxpayer) is owned directly by one or more of the other corporations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the taxpayer owns directly 20 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, of at least one of the other corporations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The term &ldquo;value&rdquo; means, with respect to securities (other than those of majority-owned subsidiaries) for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such securities; and with respect to other securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith by the board of directors, except that in the case of securities of majority-owned subsidiaries which are investment companies such fair value shall not exceed market value or asset value, whichever is higher.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) All other terms shall have the same meaning as when used in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A corporation which meets the requirements of subsections (b)(3) and (c) at the close of any quarter shall not lose its status as a regulated investment company because of a discrepancy during a subsequent quarter between the value of its various investments and such requirements unless such discrepancy exists immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property and is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition. A corporation which does not meet such requirements at the close of any quarter by reason of a discrepancy existing immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property which is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition during such quarter shall not lose its status for such quarter as a regulated investment company if such discrepancy is eliminated within 30 days after the close of such quarter and in such cases it shall be considered to have met such requirements at the close of such quarter for purposes of applying the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Investment companies furnishing capital to development corporations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Securities and Exchange Commission determines, in accordance with regulations issued by it, and certifies to the Secretary not earlier than 60 days prior to the close of the taxable year of a management company or a business development company described in subsection (a)(1), that such investment company is principally engaged in the furnishing of capital to other corporations which are principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions, technological improvements, new processes, or products not previously generally available, such investment company may, in the computation of 50 percent of the value of its assets under subparagraph (A) of subsection (b)(3) for any quarter of such taxable year, include the value of any securities of an issuer, whether or not the investment company owns more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, the basis of which, when added to the basis of the investment company for securities of such issuer previously acquired, did not exceed 5 percent of the value of the total assets of the investment company at the time of the subsequent acquisition of securities. The preceding sentence shall not apply to the securities of an issuer if the investment company has continuously held any security of such issuer (or of any predecessor company of such issuer as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) for 10 or more years preceding such quarter of such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of this subsection shall not apply at the close of any quarter of a taxable year to an investment company if at the close of such quarter more than 25 percent of the value of its total assets is represented by secu<!-- PDFPage:1385 -->rities of issuers with respect to each of which the investment company holds more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and in respect of each of which or any predecessor thereof the investment company has continuously held any security for 10 or more years preceding such quarter unless the value of its total assets so represented is reduced to 25 percent or less within 30 days after the close of such quarter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determination of status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, unless the Securities and Exchange Commission determines otherwise, a corporation shall be considered to be principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions, technological improvements, new processes, or products not previously generally available, for at least 10 years after the date of the first acquisition of any security in such corporation or any predecessor thereof by such investment company if at the date of such acquisition the corporation or its predecessor was principally so engaged, and an investment company shall be considered at any date to be furnishing capital to any company whose securities it holds if within 10 years prior to such date it has acquired any of such securities, or any securities surrendered in exchange therefor, from such other company or predecessor thereof. For purposes of the certification under this subsection, the Securities and Exchange Commission shall have authority to issue such rules, regulations and orders, and to conduct such investigations and hearings, either public or private, as it may deem appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The terms used in this subsection shall have the same meaning as in subsections (b)(3) and (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Certain unit investment trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A unit investment trust (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) substantially all of the assets of which, as to all such series, consist of (i) securities issued by a single management company (as defined in such Act) and securities acquired pursuant to subparagraph (C), or (ii) securities issued by a single other corporation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) which has no power to invest in any other securities except securities issued by a single other management company, when permitted by such Act or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall not be treated as a person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In the case of a unit investment trust described in paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) each holder of an interest in such trust shall, to the extent of such interest, be treated as owning a proportionate share of the assets of such trust;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the basis of the assets of such trust which are treated under subparagraph (A) as being owned by a holder of an interest in such trust shall be the same as the basis of his interest in such trust; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in determining the period for which the holder of an interest in such trust has held the assets of the trust which are treated under subparagraph (A) as being owned by him, there shall be included the period for which such holder has held his interest in such trust.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">This subsection shall not apply in the case of a unit investment trust which is a segregated asset account under the insurance laws or regulations of a State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Special rule for series funds</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a regulated investment company (within the meaning of subsection (a)) having more than one fund, each fund of such regulated investment company shall be treated as a separate corporation for purposes of this title (except with respect to the definitional requirement of subsection (a)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Fund defined</h4>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirements applicable to regulated investment companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this part (other than subsection (c) of this section) shall not be applicable to a regulated investment company for a taxable year unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the deduction for dividends paid during the taxable year (as defined in section 561, but without regard to capital gain dividends) equals or exceeds the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 90 percent of its investment company taxable income for the taxable year determined without regard to subsection (b)(2)(D); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 90 percent of the excess of (i) its interest income excludable from gross income under section 103(a) over (ii) its deductions disallowed under sections 265, 171(a)(2), and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the provisions of this part applied to the investment company for all taxable years ending on or after November 8, 1983, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as of the close of the taxable year, the investment company has no earnings and profits accumulated in any taxable year to which the provisions of this part (or the corresponding provisions of prior law) did not apply to it.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary may waive the requirements of paragraph (1) for any taxable year if the regulated investment company establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it was unable to meet such requirements by reason of distributions previously made to meet the requirements of section 4982.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of taxation of companies and shareholders</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Imposition of tax on regulated investment companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There is hereby imposed for each taxable year upon the investment company taxable income of every regulated investment company a tax computed as provided in section 11, as though the investment company taxable income were the taxable income referred to in section 11. In the case of a regulated investment company which is a personal holding company (as defined in section 542) or which fails to comply for the taxable year with regulations prescribed by the Secretary for the <!-- PDFPage:1388 -->purpose of ascertaining the actual ownership of its stock, such tax shall be computed at the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Investment company taxable income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The investment company taxable income shall be the taxable income of the regulated investment company adjusted as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) There shall be excluded the amount of the net capital gain, if any.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The net operating loss deduction provided in section 172 shall not be allowed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The deductions for corporations provided in part VIII (except section 248) in subchapter B (section 241 and following, relating to the deduction for dividends received, etc.) shall not be allowed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#852_1_target" name="852_1">1</a></sup> deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) shall be allowed, but shall be computed without regard to capital gain dividends and exempt-interest dividends.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The taxable income shall be computed without regard to section 443(b) (relating to computation of tax on change of annual accounting period).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) The taxable income shall be computed without regard to section 454(b) (relating to short-term obligations issued on a discount basis) if the company so elects in a manner prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Capital gains</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Imposition of tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">There is hereby imposed for each taxable year in the case of every regulated investment company a tax, determined as provided in section 1201(a), on the excess, if any, of the net capital gain over the deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) determined with reference to capital gain dividends only.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of capital gain dividends by shareholders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A capital gain dividend shall be treated by the shareholders as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 1 year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Definition of capital gain dividend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this part, a capital gain dividend is any dividend, or part thereof, which is designated by the company as a capital gain dividend in a written notice mailed to its shareholders not later than 60 days after the close of its taxable year; except that, if there is an increase in the excess described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for such year which results from a determination (as defined in section 860(e)), such designation may be made with respect to such increase at any time before the expiration of 120 days after the date of such determination. If the aggregate amount so designated with respect to a taxable year of the company (including capital gains dividends paid after the close of the taxable year described in section 855) is greater than the net capital gain of the taxable year, the portion of each distribution which shall be a capital gain dividend shall be only that proportion of the amount so designated which such net capital gain bears to the aggregate amount so designated. For purposes of this subparagraph, the amount of the net capital gain for a taxable year (to which an election under section 4982(e)(4) does not apply) shall be determined without regard to any net capital loss or net long-term capital loss attributable to transactions after October 31 of such year, and any such net capital loss or net long-term capital loss shall be treated as arising on the 1st day of the next taxable year. To the extent provided in regulations, the preceding sentence shall apply also for purposes of computing the taxable income of the regulated investment company.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Treatment by shareholders of undistributed capital gains</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Every shareholder of a regulated investment company at the close of the company's taxable year shall include, in computing his long-term capital gains in his return for his taxable year in which the last day of the company's taxable year falls, such amount as the company shall designate in respect of such shares in a written notice mailed to its shareholders at any time prior to the expiration of 60 days after close of its taxable year, but the amount so includible by any shareholder shall not exceed that part of the amount subjected to tax in subparagraph (A) which he would have received if all of such amount had been distributed as capital gain dividends by the company to the holders of such shares at the close of its taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For purposes of this title, every such shareholder shall be deemed to have paid, for his taxable year under clause (i), the tax imposed by subparagraph (A) on the amounts required by this subparagraph to be included in respect of such shares in computing his long-term capital gains for that year; and such shareholder shall be allowed credit or refund, as the case may be, for the tax so deemed to have been paid by him.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The adjusted basis of such shares in the hands of the shareholder shall be increased, with respect to the amounts required by this subparagraph to be included in computing his long-term capital gains, by the difference between the amount of such includible gains and the tax deemed paid by such shareholder in respect of such shares under clause (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) In the event of such designation the tax imposed by subparagraph (A) shall be paid by the regulated investment company within 30 days after close of its taxable year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) The earnings and profits of such regulated investment company, and the earnings and profits of any such shareholder which is a corporation, shall be appropriately adjusted in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Loss on sale or exchange of stock held 6 months or less</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Loss attributable to capital gain dividend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1389 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) subparagraph (B) or (D) of paragraph (3) provides that any amount with respect to any share is to be treated as long-term capital gain, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such share is held by the taxpayer for 6 months or less,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then any loss (to the extent not disallowed under subparagraph (B)) on the sale or exchange of such share shall, to the extent of the amount described in clause (i), be treated as a long-term capital loss.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Loss attributable to exempt-interest dividend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a shareholder of a regulated investment company receives an exempt-interest dividend with respect to any share, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such share is held by the taxpayer for 6 months or less,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then any loss on the sale or exchange of such share shall, to the extent of the amount of such exempt-interest dividend, be disallowed.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Determination of holding periods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the rules of paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 246(c) shall apply in determining the period for which the taxpayer has held any share of stock; except that &ldquo;6 months&rdquo; shall be substituted for each number of days specified in subparagraph (B)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#852_2_target" name="852_2">2</a></sup> of section 246(c)(3).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Losses incurred under a periodic liquidation plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent provided in regulations, subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply to losses incurred on the sale or exchange of shares of stock in a regulated investment company pursuant to a plan which provides for the periodic liquidation of such shares.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Authority to shorten required holding period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a regulated investment company which regularly distributes at least 90 percent of its net tax-exempt interest, the Secretary may by regulations prescribe that subparagraph (B) (and subparagraph (C) to the extent it relates to subparagraph (B)) shall be applied on the basis of a holding period requirement shorter than 6 months; except that such shorter holding period requirement shall not be shorter than the greater of 31 days or the period between regular distributions of exempt-interest dividends.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Exempt-interest dividends</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, at the close of each quarter of its taxable year, at least 50 percent of the value (as defined in section 851(c)(4)) of the total assets of the regulated investment company consists of obligations described in section 103(a), such company shall be qualified to pay exempt-interest dividends, as defined herein, to its shareholders.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An exempt-interest dividend means any dividend or part thereof (other than a capital gain dividend) paid by a regulated investment company and designated by it as an exempt-interest dividend in a written notice mailed to its shareholders not later than 60 days after the close of its taxable year. If the aggregate amount so designated with respect to a taxable year of the company (including exempt-interest dividends paid after the close of the taxable year as described in section 855) is greater than the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount of interest excludable from gross income under section 103(a), over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amounts disallowed as deductions under sections 265 and 171(a)(2),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the portion of such distribution which shall constitute an exempt-interest dividend shall be only that proportion of the amount so designated as the amount of such excess for such taxable year bears to the amount so designated.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment of exempt-interest dividends by shareholders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An exempt-interest dividend shall be treated by the shareholders for all purposes of this subtitle as an item of interest excludable from gross income under section 103(a). Such purposes include but are not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the determination of gross income and taxable income,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the determination of distributable net income under subchapter J,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the allowance of, or calculation of the amount of, any credit or deduction, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the determination of the basis in the hands of any shareholder of any share of stock of the company.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Section 311(b) not to apply to certain distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Section 311(b) shall not apply to any distribution by a regulated investment company to which this part applies, if such distribution is in redemption of its stock upon the demand of the shareholder.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Time certain dividends taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this title, any dividend declared by a regulated investment company in October, November, or December of any calendar year and payable to shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month shall be deemed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to have been received by each shareholder on December 31 of such calendar year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to have been paid by such company on December 31 of such calendar year (or, if earlier, as provided in section 855).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The preceding sentence shall apply only if such dividend is actually paid by the company during January of the following calendar year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Special rule for treatment of certain foreign currency losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent provided in regulations, the taxable income of a regulated investment <!-- PDFPage:1390 -->company (other than a company to which an election under section 4982(e)(4) applies) shall be computed without regard to any net foreign currency loss attributable to transactions after October 31 of such year, and any such net foreign currency loss shall be treated as arising on the 1st day of the following taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Dividends treated as received by company on ex-dividend date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this title, if a regulated investment company is the holder of record of any share of stock on the record date for any dividend payable with respect to such stock, such dividend shall be included in gross income by such company as of the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the date such share became ex-dividend with respect to such dividend, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the date such company acquired such share.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Special rule for certain losses on stock in passive foreign investment company</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent provided in regulations, the taxable income of a regulated investment company (other than a company to which an election under section 4982(e)(4) applies) shall be computed without regard to any net reduction in the value of any stock of a passive foreign investment company with respect to which an election under section 1296(k) is in effect occurring after October 31 of the taxable year, and any such reduction shall be treated as occurring on the first day of the following taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Earnings and profits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The earnings and profits of a regulated investment company for any taxable year (but not its accumulated earnings and profits) shall not be reduced by any amount which is not allowable as a deduction in computing its taxable income for such taxable year. For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;regulated investment company&rdquo; includes a domestic corporation which is a regulated investment company determined without regard to the requirements of subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Coordination with tax on undistributed income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of applying this chapter to distributions made by a regulated investment company with respect to any calendar year, the earnings and profits of such company shall be determined without regard to any net capital loss (or net foreign currency loss) attributable to transactions after October 31 of such year, without regard to any net reduction in the value of any stock of a passive foreign investment company with respect to which an election under section 1296(k) is in effect occurring after October 31 of such year, and with such other adjustments as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe. The preceding sentence shall apply&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) only to the extent that the amount distributed by the company with respect to the calendar year does not exceed the required distribution for such calendar year (as determined under section 4982 by substituting &ldquo;100 percent&rdquo; for each percentage set forth in section 4982(b)(1)), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) except as provided in regulations, only if an election under section 4982(e)(4) is not in effect with respect to such company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Distributions in redemption of interests in unit investment trusts</h4>
