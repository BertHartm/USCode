<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1233. Gains and losses from short sales</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Capital assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subtitle, gain or loss from the short sale of property shall be considered as gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset to the extent that the property, including a commodity future, used to close the short sale constitutes a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Short-term gains and holding periods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If gain or loss from a short sale is considered as gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset under subsection (a) and if on the date of such short sale substantially identical property has been held by the taxpayer for not more than 1 year (determined without regard to the effect, under paragraph (2) of this subsection, of such short sale on the holding period), or if substantially identical property is acquired by the taxpayer after such short sale and on or before the date of the closing thereof&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any gain on the closing of such short sale shall be considered as a gain on the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for not more than 1 year (notwithstanding the period of time any property used to close such short sale has been held); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the holding period of such substantially identical property shall be considered to begin (notwithstanding section 1223, relating to the holding period of property) on the date of the closing of the short sale, or on the date of a sale, gift, or other disposition of such property, whichever date occurs first. This paragraph shall apply to such substantially identical property in the order of the dates of the acquisition of such property, but only to so much of such property as does not exceed the quantity sold short.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this subsection, the acquisition of an option to sell property at a fixed price shall be considered as a short sale, and the exercise or failure to exercise such option shall be considered as a closing of such short sale.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certain options to sell</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (b) shall not include an option to sell property at a fixed price acquired on the same day on which the property identified as intended to be used in exercising such option is acquired and which, if exercised, is exercised through the sale of the property so identified. If the option is not exercised, the cost of the option shall be added to the basis of the property with which the option is identified. This subsection shall apply only to options acquired after August 16, 1954.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Long-term losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If on the date of such short sale substantially identical property has been held by the taxpayer for more than 1 year, any loss on the closing of such short sale shall be considered as a loss on the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 1 year (notwithstanding the period of time any property used to close such short sale has been held, and notwithstanding section 1234).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Rules for application of section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subsection (b)(1) or (d) shall not apply to the gain or loss, respectively, on any quantity of property used to close such short sale which is in excess of the quantity of the substantially identical property referred to in the applicable subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of subsections (b) and (d)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the term &ldquo;property&rdquo; includes only stocks and securities (including stocks and securities dealt with on a &ldquo;when issued&rdquo; basis), and commodity futures, which are capital assets in the hands of the taxpayer, but does not include any position to which section 1092(b) applies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of futures transactions in any commodity on or subject to the rules of a board of trade or commodity exchange, a commodity future requiring delivery in 1 calendar month shall not be considered as property substantially identical to another commodity future requiring delivery in a different calendar month;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the case of a short sale of property by an individual, the term &ldquo;taxpayer&rdquo;, in the application of this subsection and subsections (b) and (d), shall be read as &ldquo;taxpayer or his spouse&rdquo;; but an individual who is legally separated from the taxpayer under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance shall not be considered as the spouse of the taxpayer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a securities futures contract (as defined in section 1234B) to acquire substantially identical property shall be treated as substantially identical property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) entering into a securities futures contract (as so defined) to sell shall be considered to be a short sale, and the settlement of such contract shall be considered to be the closing of such short sale.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Where the taxpayer enters into 2 commodity futures transactions on the same day, one requiring delivery by him in one market and the other requiring delivery to him of the same (or substantially identical) commodity in the same calendar month in a different market, and the taxpayer subsequently closes both such trans<!-- PDFPage:1970 -->actions on the same day, subsections (b) and (d) shall have no application to so much of the commodity involved in either such transaction as does not exceed in quantity the commodity involved in the other.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) In the case of a taxpayer who is a dealer in securities (within the meaning of section 1236)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) if, on the date of a short sale of stock, substantially identical property which is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer has been held for not more than 1 year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if such short sale is closed more than 20 days after the date on which it was made,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">subsection (b)(2) shall apply in respect of the holding period of such substantially identical property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the last sentence of subsection (b) applies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the term &ldquo;stock&rdquo; means any share or certificate of stock in a corporation, any bond or other evidence of indebtedness which is convertible into any such share or certificate, or any evidence of an interest in, or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Arbitrage operations in securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a short sale which had been entered into as an arbitrage operation, to which sale the rule of subsection (b)(2) would apply except as otherwise provided in this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) subsection (b)(2) shall apply first to substantially identical assets acquired for arbitrage operations held at the close of business on the day such sale is made, and only to the extent that the quantity sold short exceeds the substantially identical assets acquired for arbitrage operations held at the close of business on the day such sale is made, shall the holding period of any other such identical assets held by the taxpayer be affected;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the event that assets acquired for arbitrage operations are disposed of in such manner as to create a net short position in assets acquired for arbitrage operations, such net short position shall be deemed to constitute a short sale made on that day;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for the purpose of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection the taxpayer will be deemed as of the close of any business day to hold property which he is or will be entitled to receive or acquire by virtue of any other asset acquired for arbitrage operations or by virtue of any contract he has entered into in an arbitrage operation; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Nonapplication of subsection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Gains</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If more than 5 lots or parcels contained in the same tract of real property are sold or exchanged, gain from any sale or exchange (which occurs in or after the taxable year in which the sixth lot or parcel is sold or exchanged) of any lot or parcel which comes within the provisions of paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of subsection (a) of this section shall be deemed to be gain from the sale of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the trade or business to the extent of 5 percent of the selling price.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Expenditures of sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of computing gain under paragraph (1) of this subsection, expenditures incurred in connection with the sale or exchange of any lot or parcel shall neither be allowed as a deduction in computing taxable income, nor treated as reducing the amount realized on such sale or exchange; but so much of such expenditures as does not exceed the portion of gain deemed under paragraph (1) of this subsection to be gain from the sale of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of trade or business shall be so allowed as a deduction, and the remainder, if any, shall be treated as reducing the amount realized on such sale or exchange.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the lot or parcel, the value of which was substantially enhanced by such improvement, would not have been marketable at the prevailing local price for similar building sites without such improvement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the taxpayer elects, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to make no adjustment to basis of the lot or parcel, or of any other property owned by the taxpayer, on account of the expenditures for such improvements.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Tract defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;tract of real property&rdquo; means a single piece of real property, except that 2 or more pieces of real property shall be considered a tract if at any time they were contiguous in the hands of the taxpayer or if they would be contiguous except for the interposition of a road, street, railroad, stream, or similar property. If, following the sale or exchange of any lot or parcel from a tract of real property, no further sales or exchanges of any other lots or parcels from the remainder of such tract are made for a period of 5 years, such remainder shall be deemed a tract.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation on tax applicable to individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an individual, if the stock sold or exchanged is a capital asset (within the meaning of section 1221) and has been held for more than 1 year, the tax attributable to an amount included in gross income as a dividend under subsection (a) shall not be greater than a tax equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an amount equal to the tax that would result by including in gross income, as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 1 year, an amount equal to the excess of (A) the amount included in gross income as a dividend under subsection (a), over (B) the amount determined under paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) are attributable (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) to the stock of such other foreign corporation which such person owned within the meaning of section 958(a)(2) (by reason of his ownership within the meaning of section 958(a)(1)(A) of the stock sold or exchanged) on the date of such sale or exchange (or on the date of any sale or exchange of the stock of such other foreign corporation occurring during the 5-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange of the stock of such foreign corporation, to the extent not otherwise taken into account under this section but not in excess of the fair market value of the stock of such other foreign corporation sold or exchanged over the basis of such stock (for determining gain) in the hands of the transferor); and</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A transfer of a franchise, trademark, or trade name shall not be treated as a sale or exchange of a capital asset if the transferor retains any significant power, right, or continuing interest with respect to the subject matter of the franchise, trademark, or trade name.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Amounts received or accrued on account of a transfer, sale, or other disposition of a franchise, trademark, or trade name which are contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the franchise, trademark, or trade name transferred shall be treated as amounts received or accrued from the sale or other disposition of property which is not a capital asset.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any amount paid or incurred on account of a transfer, sale, or other disposition of a franchise, trademark, or trade name to which paragraph (1) does not apply shall be treated as an amount chargeable to capital account.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Renewals, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of determining the term of a transfer agreement under this section, there shall be taken into account all renewal options (and any other period for which the parties reasonably expect the agreement to be renewed).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount treated as ordinary income under subsection (a) with respect to any prior disposition or other termination of a position which was held as a part of such transaction.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1260. Gains from constructive ownership transactions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the taxpayer has gain from a constructive ownership transaction with respect to any financial asset and such gain would (without regard to this section) be treated as a long-term capital gain&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such gain shall be treated as ordinary income to the extent that such gain exceeds the net underlying long-term capital gain, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the extent such gain is treated as a long-term capital gain after the application of paragraph (1), the determination of the capital gain rate (or rates) applicable to such gain under section 1(h) shall be determined on the basis of the respective rate (or rates) that would have been applicable to the net underlying long-term capital gain.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Interest charge on deferral of gain recognition</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any gain is treated as ordinary income for any taxable year by reason of subsection (a)(1), the tax imposed by this chapter for such taxable year shall be increased by the amount of interest determined under paragraph (2) with respect to each prior taxable year during any portion of which the constructive ownership transaction was open. Any amount payable under this paragraph shall be taken into account in computing the amount of any deduction allowable to the taxpayer for interest paid or accrued during such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of interest determined under this paragraph with respect to a prior taxable year is the amount of interest which would have been imposed under section 6601 on the underpayment of tax for such year which would have resulted if the gain (which is treat<!-- PDFPage:2015 -->ed as ordinary income by reason of subsection (a)(1)) had been included in gross income in the taxable years in which it accrued (determined by treating the income as accruing at a constant rate equal to the applicable Federal rate as in effect on the day the transaction closed). The period during which such interest shall accrue shall end on the due date (without extensions) for the return of tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which such transaction closed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Applicable Federal rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (2), the applicable Federal rate is the applicable Federal rate determined under section 1274(d) (compounded semiannually) which would apply to a debt instrument with a term equal to the period the transaction was open.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) No credits against increase in tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any increase in tax under paragraph (1) shall not be treated as tax imposed by this chapter for purposes of determining&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of any credit allowable under this chapter, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of the tax imposed by section 55.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Financial asset</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;financial asset&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any equity interest in any pass-thru entity, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to the extent provided in regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any debt instrument, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any stock in a corporation which is not a pass-thru entity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Pass-thru entity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;pass-thru entity&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a regulated investment company,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a real estate investment trust,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) an S corporation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a partnership,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) a trust,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) a common trust fund,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) a passive foreign investment company (as defined in section 1297 without regard to subsection (d) thereof), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) a REMIC.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Constructive ownership transaction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The taxpayer shall be treated as having entered into a constructive ownership transaction with respect to any financial asset if the taxpayer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) holds a long position under a notional principal contract with respect to the financial asset,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) enters into a forward or futures contract to acquire the financial asset,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) is the holder of a call option, and is the grantor of a put option, with respect to the financial asset and such options have substantially equal strike prices and substantially contemporaneous maturity dates, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, enters into one or more other transactions (or acquires one or more positions) that have substantially the same effect as a transaction described in any of the preceding subparagraphs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception for positions which are marked to market</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This section shall not apply to any constructive ownership transaction if all of the positions which are part of such transaction are marked to market under any provision of this title or the regulations thereunder.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Long position under notional principal contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person shall be treated as holding a long position under a notional principal contract with respect to any financial asset if such person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) has the right to be paid (or receive credit for) all or substantially all of the investment yield (including appreciation) on such financial asset for a specified period, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is obligated to reimburse (or provide credit for) all or substantially all of any decline in the value of such financial asset.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Forward contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;forward contract&rdquo; means any contract to acquire in the future (or provide or receive credit for the future value of) any financial asset.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Net underlying long-term capital gain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, in the case of any constructive ownership transaction with respect to any financial asset, the term &ldquo;net underlying long-term capital gain&rdquo; means the aggregate net capital gain that the taxpayer would have had if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the financial asset had been acquired for fair market value on the date such transaction was opened and sold for fair market value on the date such transaction was closed, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) only gains and losses that would have resulted from the deemed ownership under paragraph (1) were taken into account.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The amount of the net underlying long-term capital gain with respect to any financial asset shall be treated as zero unless the amount thereof is established by clear and convincing evidence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Special rule where taxpayer takes delivery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if a constructive ownership transaction is closed by reason of taking delivery, this section shall be applied as if the taxpayer had sold all the contracts, options, or other positions which are part of such transaction for fair market value on the closing date. The amount of gain recognized under the preceding sentence shall not exceed the amount of gain treated as ordinary income under subsection (a). Proper adjustments shall be made in the amount of any gain or loss subsequently realized for gain recognized and treated as ordinary income under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out <!-- PDFPage:2016 -->the purposes of this section, including regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to permit taxpayers to mark to market constructive ownership transactions in lieu of applying this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to exclude certain forward contracts which do not convey substantially all of the economic return with respect to a financial asset.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this section, gain on the disposition of any market discount bond shall be treated as ordinary income to the extent it does not exceed the accrued market discount on such bond. Such gain shall be recognized notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Dispositions other than sales, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a person disposing of any market discount bond in any transaction other than a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion shall be treated as realizing an amount equal to the fair market value of the bond.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of partial principal payments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any partial principal payment on a market discount bond shall be included in gross income as ordinary income to the extent such payment does not exceed the accrued market discount on such bond.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If subparagraph (A) applies to any partial principal payment on any market discount bond, for purposes of applying this section to any disposition of (or subsequent partial principal payment on) such bond, the amount of accrued market discount shall be reduced by the amount of such partial principal payment included in gross income under subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Gain treated as interest for certain purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except for purposes of sections 103, 871(a),,<sup><a href="#1276_1_target" name="1276_1">1</a></sup> 881, 1441, 1442, and 6049 (and such other provisions as may be specified in regulations), any amount treated as ordinary income under paragraph (1) or (3) shall be treated as interest for purposes of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of days after the date the taxpayer acquired the bond and up to (and including) the date of its maturity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Election of accrual on basis of constant interest rate (in lieu of ratable accrual)</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">At the election of the taxpayer with respect to any bond, the accrued market discount on such bond shall be the aggregate amount which would have been includible in the gross income of the taxpayer under section 1272(a) (determined without regard to paragraph (2) thereof) with respect to such bond for all periods during which the bond was held by the taxpayer if such bond had been&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) originally issued on the date on which such bond was acquired by the taxpayer,</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Treatment of nonrecognition transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Transferred basis property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a market discount bond is transferred in a nonrecognition transaction and such bond is <!-- PDFPage:2031 -->transferred basis property in the hands of the transferee, for purposes of determining the amount of the accrued market discount with respect to the transferee&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) proper adjustments shall be made for gain recognized by the transferor on such transfer (and for any original issue discount or market discount included in the gross income of the transferor).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exchanged basis property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any market discount bond is disposed of by the taxpayer in a nonrecognition transaction and paragraph (1) does not apply to such transaction, any accrued market discount determined with respect to the property disposed of to the extent not theretofore treated as ordinary income under subsection (a)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), if the basis of any market discount bond in the hands of a transferee is determined under section 732(a), or 732(b), such property shall be treated as transferred basis property in the hands of such transferee.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of paragraph (2), ratable shares shall be determined on the basis of their respective fair market values on the date of purchase.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Tax treatment of person stripping bond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subtitle, if any person strips 1 or more coupons from a bond and after July 1, 1982, disposes of the bond or such coupon&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such person shall include in gross income an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the interest accrued on such bond while held by such person and before the time such coupon or bond was disposed of (to the extent such interest has not theretofore been included in such person's gross income), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">then the gain on the sale or other disposition of such bond by such purchaser (or by a person whose basis is determined by reference to the basis in the hands of such purchaser) shall be considered as ordinary income to the extent that the fair market value (determined as of the time of the purchase) of the bond with coupons attached exceeds the purchase price. If this subsection and section 1271(a)(2)(A) apply with respect to gain realized on the sale or exchange of any evidence of indebtedness, then section 1271(a)(2)(A) shall apply with respect to that part of the gain to which this subsection does not apply.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount included in gross income under subsection (b)(1)(B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Tax-exempt portion</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Inclusion</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Every United States person who owns (or is treated under section 1298(a) as owning) stock of a qualified electing fund at any time during the taxable year of such fund shall include in gross income&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) as ordinary income, such shareholder's pro rata share of the ordinary earnings of such fund for such year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as long-term capital gain, such shareholder's pro rata share of the net capital gain of such fund for such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Year of inclusion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The inclusion under paragraph (1) shall be for the taxable year of the shareholder in which or with which the taxable year of the fund ends.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Pro rata share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The pro rata share referred to in subsection (a) in the case of any shareholder is the amount which would have been distributed with respect to the shareholder's stock if, on each day during the taxable year of the fund, the fund had distributed to each shareholder a pro rata share of that day's ratable share of the fund's ordinary earnings and net capital gain for such year. To the extent provided in regulations, if the fund establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it uses a shorter period than the taxable year to determine shareholders&rsquo; interests in the earnings of such fund, pro rata shares may be determined by using such shorter period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Previously taxed amounts distributed tax free</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that any amount distributed by a passive foreign investment company is paid out of earnings and profits of the company which were included under subsection (a) in the income of any United States person, such amount shall be treated, for purposes of this chapter, as a distribution which is not a dividend; except that such distribution shall immediately reduce earnings and profits. If the passive foreign investment company is a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957(a)), the preceding sentence shall not apply to any United States shareholder (as defined in section 951(b)) in such corporation, and, in applying section 959 to any such shareholder, any inclusion under this section shall be treated as an inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Basis adjustments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the adjustments under paragraph (1) shall apply to such stock in the hands of the person actually holding such stock but only for purposes of determining the subsequent treatment under this chapter of the United States person with respect to such stock, and</p>
