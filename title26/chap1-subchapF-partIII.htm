<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Organizations subject to tax</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Organizations described in sections 401(a) and 501(c)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The tax imposed by paragraph (1) shall apply in the case of any organization (other than a trust described in subsection (b) or an organization described in section 501(c)(1)) which is exempt, except as provided in this part or part II (relating to private foundations), from taxation under this subtitle by reason of section 501(a).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) State colleges and universities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The tax imposed by paragraph (1) shall apply in the case of any college or university which is an agency or instrumentality of any government or any political subdivision thereof, or which is owned or operated by a government or any political subdivision thereof, or by any agency or instrumentality of one or more governments or political subdivisions. Such tax shall also apply in the case of any corporation wholly owned by one or more such colleges or universities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Tax on charitable, etc., trusts</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">There is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the unrelated business taxable income of every trust described in paragraph (2) a tax computed as provided in section 1(e).

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) pays any amount of its net income for a taxable year to an organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) (or which would pay such an amount but for the fact that the expenses of collecting its income exceed its income), and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this title&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the term &ldquo;unrelated business taxable income&rdquo; means the gross income derived by any organization from any unrelated trade or business (as defined in section 513) regularly carried on by it, less the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the carrying on of such trade or business, both computed with the modifications provided in subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule for foreign organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an organization described in section 511 which is a foreign organization, the unrelated business taxable income shall be&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1082 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) its unrelated business taxable income which is derived from sources within the United States and which is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) its unrelated business taxable income which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rules applicable to organizations described in paragraph (7), (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c)</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an organization described in paragraph (7), (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c), the term &ldquo;unrelated business taxable income&rdquo; means the gross income (excluding any exempt function income), less the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the production of the gross income (excluding exempt function income), both computed with the modifications provided in paragraphs (6), (10), (11), and (12) of subsection (b). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the deductions provided by sections 243, 244, and 245 (relating to dividends received by corporations) shall be treated as not directly connected with the production of gross income.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exempt function income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;exempt function income&rdquo; means the gross income from dues, fees, charges, or similar amounts paid by members of the organization as consideration for providing such members or their dependents or guests goods, facilities, or services in furtherance of the purposes constituting the basis for the exemption of the organization to which such income is paid. Such term also means all income (other than an amount equal to the gross income derived from any unrelated trade or business regularly carried on by such organization computed as if the organization were subject to paragraph (1)), which is set aside&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for a purpose specified in section 170(c)(4), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of an organization described in paragraph (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c), to provide for the payment of life, sick, accident, or other benefits,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">including reasonable costs of administration directly connected with a purpose described in clause (i) or (ii). If during the taxable year, an amount which is attributable to income so set aside is used for a purpose other than that described in clause (i) or (ii), such amount shall be included, under subparagraph (A), in unrelated business taxable income for the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Applicability to certain corporations described in section 501(c)(2)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a corporation described in section 501(c)(2), the income of which is payable to an organization described in paragraph (7), (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c), subparagraph (A) shall apply as if such corporation were the organization to which the income is payable. For purposes of the preceding sentence, such corporation shall be treated as having exempt function income for a taxable year only if it files a consolidated return with such organization for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Nonrecognition of gain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If property used directly in the performance of the exempt function of an organization described in paragraph (7), (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c) is sold by such organization, and within a period beginning 1 year before the date of such sale, and ending 3 years after such date, other property is purchased and used by such organization directly in the performance of its exempt function, gain (if any) from such sale shall be recognized only to the extent that such organization's sales price of the old property exceeds the organization's cost of purchasing the other property. For purposes of this subparagraph, the destruction in whole or in part, theft, seizure, requisition, or condemnation of property, shall be treated as the sale of such property, and rules similar to the rules provided by subsections (b), (c), (e), and (j) of section 1034 shall apply.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Limitation on amount of setaside in the case of organizations described in paragraph (9), (17), or (20) of section 501(c)</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an organization acquires real property for the principal purpose of using the land (commencing within 10 years of the time of acquisition) in the manner described in paragraph (1)(A) and at the time of acquisition the property is in the neighborhood of other property owned by the organization which is used in such manner, the real property acquired for such future use shall not be treated as debt-financed property so long as the organization does not abandon its intent to so use the land within the 10-year period. The preceding sentence shall not apply for any period after the expiration of the 10-year period, and shall apply after the first 5 years of the 10-year period only if the organization establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it is reasonably certain that the land will be used in the described manner before the expiration of the 10-year period.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Other cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the first sentence of subparagraph (A) is inapplicable only because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the acquired land is not in the neighborhood referred to in subparagraph (A), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the organization (for the period after the first 5 years of the 10-year period) is unable to establish to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it is reasonably certain that the land will be used in the manner described inparagraph (1)(A) before the expiration of the 10-year period,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">but the land is converted to such use by the organization within the 10-year period, the real property (subject to the provisions of subparagraph (D)) shall not be treated as debt-financed property for any period before such conversion. For purposes of this subparagraph, land shall not be treated as used in the manner described in paragraph (1)(A) by reason of the use made of any structure which was on the land when acquired by the organization.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraphs (A) and (B)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall apply with respect to any structure on the land when acquired by the organization, or to the land occupied by the structure, only if (and so long as) the intended future use of the land in the manner described in paragraph (1)(A) requires that the structure be demolished or removed in order to use the land in such manner;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall not apply to structures erected on the land after the acquisition of the land; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) shall not apply to property subject to a lease which is a business lease (as defined in this section immediately before the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1976).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Refund of taxes when subparagraph (B) applies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an organization for any taxable year has not used land in the manner to satisfy the actual use condition of subparagraph (B) before the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for such taxable year, the tax for such year shall be computed without regard to the application of subparagraph (B), but if and when such use condition is satisfied, the provisions of subparagraph (B) shall then be applied to such taxable year. If the actual use condition of subparagraph (B) is satisfied for any taxable year after such time for filing the return, and if credit or refund of any overpayment for the taxable year resulting from the satisfaction of such use condition is prevented at the close of the taxable year in which the use condition is satisfied, by the operation of any law or rule of law (other than chapter 74, relating to closing agreements and compromises), credit or refund of such overpayment may nevertheless be allowed or made if claim therefor is filed before the expiration of 1 year after the close of the taxable year in which the use condition is satisfied.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Special rule for churches</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In applying this paragraph to a church or convention or association of churches, in lieu of the 10-year period referred to in subparagraphs (A) and (B) a 15-year period shall be applied, and subparagraphs (A) and (B)(ii) shall apply whether or not the acquired land meets the neighborhood test.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Where property (no matter how acquired) is acquired subject to a mortgage or other similar lien, the amount of the indebtedness secured by such mortgage or lien shall be considered as an indebtedness of the organization incurred in acquiring such property even though the organization did not assume or agree to pay such indebtedness.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Where property subject to a mortgage is acquired by an organization by bequest or devise, the indebtedness secured by the mortgage shall not be treated as acquisition indebtedness during a period of 10 years following the date of the acquisition. If an organization acquires property by gift subject to a mortgage which was placed on the property more than 5 years before the gift, which property was held by the donor more than 5 years before the gift, the indebtedness secured by such mortgage shall not be treated as acquisition indebtedness during a period of 10 years following the date of such gift.

<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">made by a State or a political subdivision thereof attaches to property prior to the time when such taxes or assessments become due and payable, then such lien shall be treated as similar to a mortgage (within the meaning of subparagraph (A)) but only after such taxes or assessments become due and payable and the organization has had an opportunity to pay such taxes or assessments in accordance with State law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Extension of obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, an extension, renewal, or refinancing of an obligation evidencing a pre-existing indebtedness shall not be treated as the creation of a new indebtedness.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is the sole consideration (other than a mortgage to which paragraph (2)(B) applies) issued in exchange for property if, at the time of the exchange, the value of the annuity is less than 90 percent of the value of the property received in the exchange,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) is payable under a contract which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) does not guarantee a minimum amount of payments or specify a maximum amount of payments, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) does not provide for any adjustment of the amount of the annuity payments by reference to the income received from the transferred property or any other property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Certain Federal financing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;acquisition indebtedness&rdquo; does not include an obligation, to the extent that it is insured by the Federal Housing Administration, to finance the purchase, rehabilitation, or construction of housing for low and moderate income persons.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Average acquisition indebtedness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;average acquisition indebtedness&rdquo; for any taxable year with respect to a debt-financed property means the average amount, determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the acquisition indebtedness during the period the property is held by the organization during the taxable year, except that for the purpose of computing the percentage of any gain or loss to be taken into account on a sale or other disposition of debt-financed property, such term means the highest amount of the acquisition indebtedness with respect to such property during the 12-month period ending with the date of the sale or other disposition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the term &ldquo;acquisition indebtedness&rdquo; does not, for purposes of this section, include indebtedness incurred by a qualified organization in acquiring or improving any real <!-- PDFPage:1095 -->property. For purposes of this paragraph, an interest in a mortgage shall in no event be treated as real property.</p>
