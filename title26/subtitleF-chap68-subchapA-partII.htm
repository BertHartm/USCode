<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the taxpayer establishes that none of such pricing methods was likely to result in a price that would clearly reflect income, the taxpayer used another pricing method to determine such price, and such other pricing method was likely to result in a price that would clearly reflect income,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the taxpayer has documentation (which was in existence as of the time of filing the return) which sets forth the determination of such price in accordance with such other method and which establishes that the requirements of subclause (I) were satisfied, and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of the decrease (if any) in the aggregate amount of credits determined under subtitle A which results from a difference between the taxpayer's treatment of an item to which this section applies (as shown on the taxpayer's return of tax) and the proper tax treatment of such item.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), any reduction of the excess of deductions allowed for the taxable year over gross income for such year, and any reduction in the amount of capital losses which would (without regard to section 1211) be allowed for such year, shall be treated as an increase in taxable income.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">This section shall apply to any item which is attributable to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any listed transaction, and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definitions of reportable and listed transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the terms &ldquo;reportable transaction&rdquo; and &ldquo;listed transaction&rdquo; have the respective meanings given to such terms by section 6707A(c).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of such understatement (determined without regard to this paragraph) shall be increased by the aggregate amount of reportable transaction understatements for purposes of determining whether such understatement is a substantial understatement under section 6662(d)(1), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the addition to tax under section 6662(a) shall apply only to the excess of the amount of the substantial understatement (if any) after the application of subparagraph (A) over the aggregate amount of reportable transaction understatements.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3479 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Coordination with other penalties</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Coordination with certain increased underpayment penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This section shall not apply to any portion of an understatement on which a penalty is imposed under section 6662 if the rate of the penalty is determined under subsections (h) or (i) of section 6662.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule for amended returns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in regulations, in no event shall any tax treatment included with an amendment or supplement to a return of tax be taken into account in determining the amount of any reportable transaction understatement if the amendment or supplement is filed after the earlier of the date the taxpayer is first contacted by the Secretary regarding the examination of the return or such other date as is specified by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A taxpayer shall be treated as having a reasonable belief with respect to the tax treatment of an item only if such belief&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) relates solely to the taxpayer's chances of success on the merits of such treatment and does not take into account the possibility that a return will not be audited, such treatment will not be raised on audit, or such treatment will be resolved through settlement if it is raised.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certain opinions may not be relied upon</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Disqualified opinions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), an opinion is disqualified if the opinion&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is based on unreasonable factual or legal assumptions (including assumptions as to future events),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) unreasonably relies on representations, statements, findings, or agreements of the taxpayer or any other person,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) does not identify and consider all relevant facts, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) fails to meet any other requirement as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>
