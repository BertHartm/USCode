<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of mines, oil and gas wells, other natural deposits, and timber, there shall be allowed as a deduction in computing taxable income a reasonable allowance for depletion and for depreciation of improvements, according to the peculiar conditions in each case; such reasonable allowance in all cases to be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;mines&rdquo; includes deposits of waste or residue, the extraction of ores or minerals from which is treated as mining under section 613(c). In any case in which it is ascertained as a result of operations or of development work that the recoverable units are greater or less than the prior estimate thereof, then such prior estimate (but not the basis for depletion) shall be revised and the allowance under this section for subsequent taxable years shall be based on such revised estimate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Leases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a lease, the deduction under this section shall be equitably apportioned between the lessor and lessee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Life tenant and remainderman</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of property held by one person for life with remainder to another person, the deduction under this section shall be computed as if the life tenant were the absolute owner of the property and shall be allowed to the life tenant.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Property held in trust</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of property held in trust, the deduction under this section shall be apportioned between the income beneficiaries and the trustee in accordance with the pertinent provisions of the instrument creating the <!-- PDFPage:1577 -->trust, or, in the absence of such provisions, on the basis of the trust income allocable to each.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Property held by estate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an estate, the deduction under this section shall be apportioned between the estate and the heirs, legatees, and devisees on the basis of the income of the estate allocable to each.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of the mines, wells, and other natural deposits listed in subsection (b), the allowance for depletion under section 611 shall be the percentage, specified in subsection (b), of the gross income from the property excluding from such gross income an amount equal to any rents or royalties paid or incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the property. Such allowance shall not exceed 50 percent (100 percent in the case of oil and gas properties) of the taxpayer's taxable income from the property (computed without allowance for depletion and without the deduction under section 199). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the allowable deductions taken into account with respect to expenses of mining in computing the taxable income from the property shall be decreased by an amount equal to so much of any gain which (1) is treated under section 1245 (relating to gain from disposition of certain depreciable property) as ordinary income, and (2) is properly allocable to the property. In no case shall the allowance for depletion under section 611 be less than it would be if computed without reference to this section.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Taxable income from the property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If both oil and gas are produced from the property during the taxable year, for purposes of subparagraphs (A) and (B) the taxable income from the property, in applying the taxable income limitation in section 613(a), shall be allocated between the oil production and the gas production in proportion to the gross income during the taxable year from each.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Partnerships</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a partnership, the depletion allowance shall be computed separately by the partners and not by the partnership. The partnership shall allocate to each partner his proportionate share of the adjusted basis of each partnership oil or gas property. The allocation is to be made as of the later of the date of acquisition of the oil or gas property by the partnership, or January 1, 1975. A partner's proportionate share of the adjusted basis of partnership property shall be determined in accordance with his interest in partnership capital or income and, in the case of property contributed to the partnership by a partner, section 704(c) (relating to contributed property) shall apply in determining such share. Each partner shall separately keep records of his share of the adjusted basis in each oil and gas property of the partnership, adjust such share of the ad<!-- PDFPage:1584 -->justed basis for any depletion taken on such property, and use such adjusted basis each year in the computation of his cost depletion or in the computation of his gain or loss on the disposition of such property by the partnership.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If an amount is disallowed as a deduction for the taxable year by reason of application of the preceding sentence, the disallowed amount shall be treated as an amount allowable as a deduction under subsection (c) for the following taxable year, subject to the application of the preceding sentence to such taxable year. For purposes of basis adjustments and determining whether cost depletion exceeds percentage depletion with respect to the production from a property, any amount disallowed as a deduction on the application of this paragraph shall be allocated to the respective properties from which the oil or gas was produced in proportion to the percentage depletion otherwise allowable to such properties under subsection (c).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Scope</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any election under paragraph (2) shall be for all purposes of this subtitle and shall be binding on the taxpayer for all subsequent taxable years.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rules as to operating mineral interests in mines</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Election to aggregate separate interests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except in the case of oil and gas wells and geothermal deposits, if a taxpayer owns two or more separate operating mineral interests which constitute part or all of an operating unit, he may elect (for all purposes of this subtitle)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to form an aggregation of, and to treat as one property, all such interests owned by him which comprise any one mine or any two or more mines; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to treat as a separate property each such interest which is not included within an aggregation referred to in subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this paragraph, separate operating mineral interests which constitute part or all of an operating unit may be aggregated whether or not they are included in a single tract or parcel of land and whether or not they are included in contiguous tracts or parcels. For purposes of this paragraph, a taxpayer may elect to form more than one aggregation of operating mineral interests within any one operating unit; but no aggregation may include any operating mineral interest which is a part of a mine without including all of the operating mineral interests which are a part of such mine in the first taxable year for which the election to aggregate is effective, and any operating mineral interest which thereafter becomes a part of such mine shall be included in such aggregation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Election to treat a single interest as more than one property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except in the case of oil and gas wells and geothermal deposits, if a single tract or parcel of land contains a mineral deposit which is being extracted, or will be extracted by means of two or more mines for which expenditures for development or operation have been made by the taxpayer, then the taxpayer may elect to allocate to such mines, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, all of the tract or parcel of land and of the mineral deposit contained therein, and to treat as a separate property that portion of the tract or parcel of land and of the mineral deposit so allocated to each mine. A separate property formed pursuant to an election under this paragraph shall be treated as a separate property for all purposes of this subtitle (including this paragraph). A separate property so formed may, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, be included as a part of an aggregation in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (3). The election provided by this paragraph may not be made with respect to any property which is a part of an aggregation formed by the taxpayer under paragraph (1) except with the consent of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Manner and scope of election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The elections provided by paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be made, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, not later than the time prescribed for filing the return (including extensions thereof) for the first taxable year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in which, in the case of an election under paragraph (1), any expenditure for development or operation in respect of the separate operating mineral interest is made by the taxpayer after the acquisition of such interest, or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1590 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in which, in the case of an election under paragraph (2), expenditures for development or operation of more than one mine in respect of a property are made by the taxpayer after the acquisition of the property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">An election made under paragraph (1) or (2) for a taxable year shall be binding upon the taxpayer for such year and all subsequent taxable years, except that the Secretary may consent to a different treatment of any interest with respect to which an election has been made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Operating mineral interests defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;operating mineral interest&rdquo; includes only an interest in respect of which the costs of production of the mineral are required to be taken into account by the taxpayer for purposes of computing the taxable income limitation provided for in section 613, or would be so required if the mine, well, or other natural deposit were in the production stage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special rule as to nonoperating mineral interests</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Aggregation of separate interests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a taxpayer owns two or more separate nonoperating mineral interests in a single tract or parcel of land or in two or more adjacent tracts or parcels of land, the Secretary shall, on showing by the taxpayer that a principal purpose is not the avoidance of tax, permit the taxpayer to treat (for all purposes of this subtitle) all such mineral interests in each separate kind of mineral deposit as one property. If such permission is granted for any taxable year, the taxpayer shall treat such interests as one property for all subsequent taxable years unless the Secretary consents to a different treatment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Nonoperating mineral interests defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;nonoperating mineral interests&rdquo; includes only interests which are not operating mineral interests.</p>

This section shall not apply to expenditures for the acquisition or improvement of property of a character which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167, but allowances for depreciation shall be considered, for purposes of this section, as expenditures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Election of taxpayer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the election of the taxpayer, made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, expenditures described in subsection (a) paid or incurred during the taxable year shall be treated as deferred expenses and shall be deductible on a ratable basis as the units of produced ores or minerals benefited by such expenditures are sold. In the case of such expenditures paid or <!-- PDFPage:1592 -->incurred during the development stage of the mine or deposit, the election shall apply only with respect to the excess of such expenditures during the taxable year over the net receipts during the taxable year from the ores or minerals produced from such mine or deposit. The election under this subsection, if made, must be for the total amount of such expenditures, or the total amount of such excess, as the case may be, with respect to the mine or deposit, and shall be binding for such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjusted basis of mine or deposit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of expenditures which are treated under subsection (b) as deferred expenses shall be taken into account in computing the adjusted basis of the mine or deposit, except that such amount, and the adjustments to basis provided in section 1016(a)(9), shall be disregarded in determining the adjusted basis of the property for the purpose of computing a deduction for depletion under section 611.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rules for foreign development</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any expenditures paid or incurred with respect to the development of a mine or other natural deposit (other than an oil, gas, or geothermal well) located outside of the United States&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Allowance of deduction</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At the election of the taxpayer, expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year for the purpose of ascertaining the existence, location, extent, or quality of any deposit of ore or other mineral, and paid or incurred before the beginning of the development stage of the mine, shall be allowed as a deduction in computing taxable income. This subsection shall apply only with respect to the amount of such expenditures which, but for this subsection, would not be allowable as a deduction for the taxable year. This subsection shall not apply to expenditures for the acquisition or improvement of property of a character which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167, but allowances for depreciation shall be considered, for purposes of this subsection, as expenditures paid or incurred. In no case shall this subsection apply with respect to amounts paid or incurred for the purpose of ascertaining the existence, location, extent, or quality of any deposit of oil or gas or of any mineral with respect to which a deduction for percentage depletion is not allowable under section 613.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Elections</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any election under this subsection shall be made in such manner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Time and scope</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The election provided by paragraph (1) for the taxable year may be made at any time before the expiration of the period prescribed for making a claim for credit or refund of the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year. Such an election for the taxable year shall apply to all expenditures described in paragraph (1) paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the taxable year or during any subsequent taxable year. Such an election may not be revoked unless the Secretary consents to such revocation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Deficiencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The statutory period for the assessment of any deficiency for any taxable year, to the extent such deficiency is attributable to an election or revocation of an election under this subsection, shall not expire before the last day of the 2-year period beginning on the day after the date on which such elec<!-- PDFPage:1593 -->tion or revocation of election is made; and such deficiency may be assessed at any time before the expiration of such 2-year period, notwithstanding any law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Recapture on reaching producing stage</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Recapture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, in any taxable year, any mine with respect to which expenditures were deducted pursuant to subsection (a) reaches the producing stage, then&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) If the taxpayer so elects with respect to all such mines reaching the producing stage during the taxable year, he shall include in gross income for the taxable year an amount equal to the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to such mines, and the amount so included in income shall be treated for purposes of this subtitle as expenditures which (i) are paid or incurred on the respective dates on which the mines reach the producing stage, and (ii) are properly chargeable to capital account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) If subparagraph (A) does not apply with respect to any such mine, then the deduction for depletion under section 611 with respect to the property shall be disallowed until the amount of depletion which would be allowable but for this subparagraph equals the amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to such mine.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Elections</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any election under this subsection shall be made in such manner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Time and scope</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The election provided by paragraph (1) for any taxable year may be made or changed not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return (including extensions thereof) for such taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Recapture in case of bonus or royalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an election has been made under subsection (a) with respect to expenditures relating to a mining property and the taxpayer receives or accrues a bonus or a royalty with respect to such property, then the deduction for depletion under section 611 with respect to the bonus or royalty shall be disallowed until the amount of depletion which would be allowable but for this subsection equals the amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to the property to which the bonus or royalty relates.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Gain from dispositions of certain mining property</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if mining property is disposed of the lower of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to such property, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount realized (in the case of a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion), or the fair market value (in the case of any other disposition), over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the adjusted basis of such property,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall be treated as ordinary income. Such gain shall be recognized notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Disposition of portion of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) In the case of the disposition of a portion of a mining property (other than an undivided interest), the entire amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to such property shall be treated as attributable to such portion to the extent of the amount of the gain to which paragraph (1) applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) In the case of the disposition of an undivided interest in a mining property (or a portion thereof), a proportionate part of the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to such property shall be treated as attributable to such undivided interest to the extent of the amount of the gain to which paragraph (1) applies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">This paragraph shall not apply to any expenditure to the extent the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such expenditure relates neither to the portion (or interest therein) disposed of nor to any mine, in the property held by the taxpayer before the disposition, which has reached the producing stage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exceptions and limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of section 1245(b) (relating to exceptions and limitations with respect to gain from disposition of certain depreciable property) shall apply in respect of this subsection in the same manner and with the same effect as if references in section 1245(b) to section 1245 or any provision thereof were references to this subsection or the corresponding provisions of this subsection and as if references to section 1245 property were references to mining property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Application of subsection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall apply notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Coordination with section 1254</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to any disposition to which section 1254 applies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Basis of property</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The basis of any property shall not be reduced by the amount of any depletion which would be allowable but for the application of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as he may deem necessary to provide for adjustments to the basis of property to reflect gain recognized under subsection (d)(1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Adjusted exploration expenditures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;adjusted exploration expenditures&rdquo; means, with respect to any property or mine&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1594 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of the expenditures allowed for the taxable year and all preceding taxable years as deductions under subsection (a) to the taxpayer or any other person which are properly chargeable to such property or mine and which (but for the election under subsection (a)) would be reflected in the adjusted basis of such property or mine, reduced by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for the taxable year and for each preceding taxable year, the amount (if any) by which (i) the amount which would have been allowable for percentage depletion under section 613 but for the deduction of such expenditures, exceeds (ii) the amount allowable for depletion under section 611,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">properly adjusted for any amounts included in gross income under subsection (b) or (c) and for any amounts of gain to which subsection (d) applied.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;mining property&rdquo; means any property (within the meaning of section 614 after the application of subsections (c) and (e) thereof) with respect to which any expenditures allowed as a deduction under subsection (a)(1) are properly chargeable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Disposal of coal or domestic iron ore with a retained economic interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A transaction which constitutes a disposal of coal or iron ore under section 631(c) shall be treated as a disposition. In such a case, the excess referred to in subsection (d)(1)(B) shall be treated as equal to the gain (if any) referred to in section 631(c).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Special rules relating to partnership property</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Property distributed to partner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any property or mine received by the taxpayer in a distribution with respect to part or all of his interest in a partnership, the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to such property or mine include the adjusted exploration expenditures (not otherwise included under subsection (f)(1)) with respect to such property or mine immediately prior to such distribution, but the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to any such property or mine shall be reduced by the amount of gain to which section 751(b) applied realized by the partnership (as constituted after the distribution) on the distribution of such property or mine.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Property retained by partnership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any property or mine held by a partnership after a distribution to a partner to which section 751(b) applied, the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to such property or mine shall, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, be reduced by the amount of gain to which section 751(b) applied realized by such partner with respect to such distribution on account of such property or mine.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Special rules for foreign exploration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any expenditures paid or incurred before the development stage for the purpose of ascertaining the existence, location, extent, or quality of any deposit of ore or other mineral (other than an oil, gas, or geothermal well) located outside the United States&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such expenditures shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) at the election of the taxpayer, be included in adjusted basis for purposes of computing the amount of any deduction allowable under section 611 (without regard to section 613), or</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;631. Gain or loss in the case of timber, coal, or domestic iron ore</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Election to consider cutting as sale or exchange</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the taxpayer so elects on his return for a taxable year, the cutting of timber (for sale or for use in the taxpayer's trade or business) during such year by the taxpayer who owns, or has a contract right to cut, such timber (providing he has owned such timber or has held such contract right for a period of more than 1 year) shall be considered as a sale or exchange of such timber cut during such year. If such election has been made, gain or loss to the taxpayer shall be recognized in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of such timber, and the adjusted basis for depletion of such timber in the hands of the taxpayer. Such fair market value shall be the fair market value as of <!-- PDFPage:1596 -->the first day of the taxable year in which such timber is cut, and shall thereafter be considered as the cost of such cut timber to the taxpayer for all purposes for which such cost is a necessary factor. If a taxpayer makes an election under this subsection, such election shall apply with respect to all timber which is owned by the taxpayer or which the taxpayer has a contract right to cut and shall be binding on the taxpayer for the taxable year for which the election is made and for all subsequent years, unless the Secretary, on showing of undue hardship, permits the taxpayer to revoke his election; such revocation, however, shall preclude any further elections under this subsection except with the consent of the Secretary. For purposes of this subsection and subsection (b), the term &ldquo;timber&rdquo; includes evergreen trees which are more than 6 years old at the time severed from the roots and are sold for ornamental purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Disposal of timber</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of the disposal of timber held for more than 1 year before such disposal, by the owner thereof under any form or type of contract by virtue of which such owner either retains an economic interest in such timber or makes an outright sale of such timber, the difference between the amount realized from the disposal of such timber and the adjusted depletion basis thereof, shall be considered as though it were a gain or loss, as the case may be, on the sale of such timber. In determining the gross income, the adjusted gross income, or the taxable income of the lessee, the deductions allowable with respect to rents and royalties shall be determined without regard to the provisions of this subsection. In the case of disposal of timber with a retained economic interest, the date of disposal of such timber shall be deemed to be the date such timber is cut, but if payment is made to the owner under the contract before such timber is cut the owner may elect to treat the date of such payment as the date of disposal of such timber. For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;owner&rdquo; means any person who owns an interest in such timber, including a sublessor and a holder of a contract to cut timber.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Disposal of coal or domestic iron ore with a retained economic interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of the disposal of coal (including lignite), or iron ore mined in the United States, held for more than 1 year before such disposal, by the owner thereof under any form of contract by virtue of which such owner retains an economic interest in such coal or iron ore, the difference between the amount realized from the disposal of such coal or iron ore and the adjusted depletion basis thereof plus the deductions disallowed for the taxable year under section 272 shall be considered as though it were a gain or loss, as the case may be, on the sale of such coal or iron ore. If for the taxable year of such gain or loss the maximum rate of tax imposed by this chapter on any net capital gain is less than such maximum rate for ordinary income, such owner shall not be entitled to the allowance for percentage depletion provided in section 613 with respect to such coal or iron ore. This subsection shall not apply to income realized by any owner as a co-adventurer, partner, or principal in the mining of such coal or iron ore, and the word &ldquo;owner&rdquo; means any person who owns an economic interest in coal or iron ore in place, including a sublessor. The date of disposal of such coal or iron ore shall be deemed to be the date such coal or iron ore is mined. In determining the gross income, the adjusted gross income, or the taxable income of the lessee, the deductions allowable with respect to rents and royalties shall be determined without regard to the provisions of this subsection. This subsection shall have no application, for purposes of applying subchapter G, relating to corporations used to avoid income tax on shareholders (including the determinations of the amount of the deductions under section 535(b)(6) or section 545(b)(5)). This subsection shall not apply to any disposal of iron ore or coal&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to a person whose relationship to the person disposing of such iron ore or coal would result in the disallowance of losses under section 267 or 707(b), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to a person owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests which own or control the person disposing of such iron ore or coal.</p>
