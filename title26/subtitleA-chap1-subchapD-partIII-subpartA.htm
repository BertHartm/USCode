<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Coordination between prefunding balance and funding standard carryover balance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent that any plan has a funding standard carryover balance greater than zero, no election may be made under subparagraph (A) with respect to the prefunding balance.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Adjustments for interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any excess contributions under clause (i) shall be properly adjusted for interest ac<!-- PDFPage:1279 -->cruing for the periods between the first day of the current plan year and the dates on which the excess contributions were made, determined by using the effective interest rate for the preceding plan year and by treating contributions as being first used to satisfy the minimum required contribution.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Certain contributions necessary to avoid benefit limitations disregarded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The excess described in clause (i) with respect to any preceding plan year shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of contributions an employer would be required to make under subsection (b), (c), or (e) of section 436 to avoid a benefit limitation which would otherwise be imposed under such paragraph for the preceding plan year. Any contribution which may be taken into account in satisfying the requirements of more than 1 of such paragraphs shall be taken into account only once for purposes of this clause.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Decreases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The prefunding balance of a plan shall be decreased (but not below zero) by&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Averaging allowed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A plan may determine the value of plan assets on the basis of the averaging of fair market values, but only if such method&mdash;</p>

<!-- PDFPage:1280 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) does not provide for averaging of such values over more than the period beginning on the last day of the 25th month preceding the month in which the valuation date occurs and ending on the valuation date (or a similar period in the case of a valuation date which is not the 1st day of a month), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) does not result in a determination of the value of plan assets which, at any time, is lower than 90 percent or greater than 110 percent of the fair market value of such assets at such time.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the contribution shall be taken into account as an asset of the plan as of the valuation date, except that in the case of any plan year beginning after 2008, only the present value (determined as of the valuation date) of such contribution may be taken into account. For purposes of the preceding sentence, present value shall be determined using the effective interest rate for the preceding plan year to which the contribution is properly allocable.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule for current year contributions made before valuation date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If any contributions for any plan year are made to or under the plan during the plan year but before the valuation date for the plan year, the assets of the plan as of the valuation date shall not include&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Effective interest rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;effective interest rate&rdquo; means, with respect to any plan for any plan year, the single rate of interest which, if used to determine the present value of the plan's accrued or earned benefits referred to in subsection (d)(1), would result in an amount equal to the funding target of the plan for such plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Interest rates for determining funding target</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of determining the funding target and target normal cost of a plan for any plan year, the interest rate used in determining the present value of the benefits of the plan shall be&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Election to use yield curve</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Solely for purposes of determining the minimum required contribution under this section, the plan sponsor may, in lieu of the segment rates determined under subparagraph (C), elect to use interest rates under the corporate bond yield curve. For purposes of the preceding sentence such curve shall be determined without regard to the 24-month averaging described in clause (i). Such election, once made, may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Applicable month</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;applicable month&rdquo; means, with respect to any plan for any plan year, the month which includes the valuation date of such plan for such plan year or, at the election of the plan sponsor, any of the 4 months which precede such month.

The actuary's projections shall be based on reasonable actuarial estimates, assumptions, and methods that, except as provided in clause (iii), offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan. The projected present value of liabilities as of the beginning of such year shall be determined based on the most recent of either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the actuarial statement required under section 103(d) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 with respect to the most recently filed annual report, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any failure of the plan's actuary to certify the plan's status under this subsection by the date specified in subparagraph (A) shall be treated for purposes of section 502(c)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as a failure or refusal by the plan administrator to file the annual report required to be filed with the Secretary under section 101(b)(1) of such Act.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Notice</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) such reductions may apply to participants and beneficiaries whose benefit commencement date is on or after the date such notice is provided for the first plan year in which the plan is in critical status.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Model notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor&nbsp;<sup><a href="#432_1_target" name="432_1">1</a></sup> shall prescribe a model notice that a multiemployer plan may use to satisfy the requirements under clause (ii).</p>
