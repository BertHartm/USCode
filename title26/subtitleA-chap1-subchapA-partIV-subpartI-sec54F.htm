<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Allocation formula</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount to be allocated under subparagraph (A) for any calendar year shall be allocated among large local educational agencies in proportion to the respective amounts each such agency received under section 1124 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6333) for the most recent fiscal year ending before such calendar year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Reduction in State allocation</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Allocation of unused limitation to State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount allocated under this paragraph to a large local educational agency for any calendar year may be reallocated by such agency to the State in which such agency is located for such calendar year.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Allocations to certain possessions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount to be allocated under paragraph (1) to any possession of the United States other than Puerto Rico shall be the amount which would have been allocated if all allocations under paragraph (1) were made on the basis of respective populations of individuals below the poverty line (as defined by the Office of Management and Budget).
