<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Answer:</strong> (1) <em>Time to Answer or Move:</em> The Commissioner shall have 60 days from the date of service of the petition within which to file an answer, or 45 days from that date within which to move with respect to the petition.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Form and Content:</em> The answer shall be drawn so that it will advise the petitioner and the Court fully of the nature of the defense.

If the Commissioner shall be without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an allegation as to jurisdictional facts or as to inferences or conclusions that may be drawn from materials in the administrative record or as to facts involved in a revocation, then the Commissioner may so state, and such statement shall have the effect of a denial. Facts other than jurisdictional facts, and other than facts involved in a revocation or in a governmental obligation action, may be admitted only for purposes of the pending action for declaratory judgment. If the Commissioner intends to clarify or to deny only a part of an allegation, then the Commissioner shall specify so much of it as is true and shall qualify or deny only the remainder.

With respect to an amended answer or amendments to the answer, the petitioner shall have like periods from the date of service of those papers within which to reply or move in response thereto, except as the Court may otherwise direct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Form and Content:</em> In response to each material allegation in the answer and the facts in support thereof on which the Commissioner has the burden of proof, the reply shall contain a specific admission or denial; however, if the petitioner shall be without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an allegation, then the petitioner shall so state, and such statement shall have the effect of a denial. If the petitioner denies the affirmative allegation in the answer that a complete index of the contents of the administrative record is attached to the answer, then the petitioner shall specify the reasons for such denial. In addition, the reply shall contain a clear and concise statement of every ground, together with the facts in support thereof, on which the petitioner relies affirmatively or in avoidance of any matter in the answer on which the Commissioner has the burden of proof. In other respects, the requirements of pleading applicable to the answer provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this Rule shall apply to the reply.

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Joinder in Retirement Plan Action:</strong> The joinder of parties in retirement plan actions shall be subject to the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Permissive Joinder:</em> Any person who, under Code Section 7476(b)(1), is entitled to commence an action for declaratory judgment with respect to the qualification of a retirement plan may join in filing a petition with any other such person in such an action with respect to the same plan. If the Commissioner has issued a notice of determination with respect to the qualification of the plan, then any person joining in the petition must do so within the period specified in Code Section 7476(b)(5). If more than one petition is filed with respect to the qualification of the same retirement plan, then see Rule 141 (relating to the possibility of consolidating the actions with respect to the plan).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Joinder of Additional Parties:</em> Any party to an action for declaratory judgment with respect to the qualification of a retirement plan may move to have joined in the action any employer who established or maintains the plan, plan administrator, or any person in whose absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties. Unless otherwise permitted by the Court, any such motion must be filed not later than 30 days after joinder of issue (see Rule 214). Such motion shall be served on the parties to the action (other than the movant). See Rule 21(b). The movant shall cause personal service to be made on each person sought to be joined by a United States marshal or by a deputy marshal, or by any other person who is not a party and is not less than 18 years of age, who shall make a return of service, see Form 13, Appendix I. Such return of service shall be filed with the motion, but failure to do so or otherwise to make proof of service does not affect the validity of the service. Unless otherwise permitted by the Court, any objection to such motion shall be filed within 30 days after the service of the motion. The motion will be granted whenever the Court finds that in the interests of justice such person should be joined. If the motion is granted, such person will thereupon become a party to the action, and the Court will enter such orders as it deems appropriate as to further pleading and other matters. See Rule 50(b) with respect to actions on motions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Nonjoinder of Necessary Parties:</em> If the Court determines that any person described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph is a necessary party to an action for declaratory judgment and that such person has not been joined, then the Court may, on its own motion or on the motion of any party or any such person, dismiss the action on the ground that the absent person is necessary and that justice cannot be accomplished in the absent person's absence, or direct that any such person be made a party to the action. An order dismissing a case for nonjoinder of a necessary party may be conditional or absolute.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Joinder of Parties in Exempt Organization and in Governmental Obligation Actions:</strong> Joinder of parties is not permitted in an exempt organization action or in a governmental obligation action. See Code Sections 7428(b)(1) and 7478(b)(1). With respect to consolidation of actions, see Rule 141.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 217. Disposition of Actions for Declaratory Judgment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General:</strong> Disposition of an action for declaratory judgment, which does not involve either a revocation or the status of a governmental obligation, will ordinarily be made on the basis of the administrative record, as defined in Rule 210(b)(10). Only with the permission of the Court, upon good cause shown, will any party be permitted to introduce before the Court any evidence other than that presented before the Internal Revenue Service and contained in the administrative record as so defined. Disposition of an action for declaratory judgment involving a revocation may be made on the basis of the administrative record alone only where the parties agree that such record contains all the relevant facts and that such facts are not in dispute. Disposition of a governmental obligation action will be made on the basis of the administrative record, augmented by additional evidence to the extent that the Court may direct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Procedure:</strong> (1) <em>Disposition on the Administrative Record:</em> The Court expects that, within 30 days after service of the answer, the parties will file with the Court the entire administrative record (or so much thereof as either party may deem necessary for a complete disposition of the action for declaratory judgment), stipulated as to its genuineness. If, however, the parties are unable to file such a stipulated administrative record, then, not sooner than 30 days nor later than 45 days after service of the answer, the Commissioner shall file with the Court the entire administrative record, as defined in Rule 210(b)(10), appropriately certified as to its genuineness by the Commissioner or by an official authorized to act for the Commissioner in such situation. See Rule 212, as to the time and place for submission of the action to the Court. The Court will thereafter issue an opinion and declaratory judgment in the action. Except in a case involving a revocation or the status of a governmental obligation, the Court's decision will be based upon the assumption that the facts as represented in the administrative record as so stipulated or so certified are true and upon any additional facts as found by the Court if the Court deems that a trial is necessary. In the case of a revocation or a governmental obligation action, the Court may, upon the basis of the evidence presented, make findings of fact which differ from the administrative record. In the case of a governmental obligation action, see the last sentence of paragraph (a) of this Rule. See subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Other Dispositions Without Trial:</em> In addition, an action for declaratory judgment may be decided on a motion for a judgment on the pleadings under Rule 120 or on a motion for summary judgment under Rule 121 or such an action may be submitted at any time by notice of the parties filed with the Court in accordance with Rule 122.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Disposition Where Trial is Required:</em> Whenever a trial is required in an action for declaratory judgment, such trial shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules contained in Title XIV, except as otherwise provided in this Title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Burden of Proof:</strong> The burden of proof in declaratory judgment actions shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Retirement Plan Actions:</em> (A) <em>Parties Petitioner:</em> In all cases, the burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner as to jurisdictional requirements. The burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner, and upon any party joining or intervening on the petitioner's side, as to those grounds set forth in the respondent's notice of determination that a retirement plan does not qualify. If the respondent has determined that a retirement plan does qualify, then the petitioner, and any party joining or intervening on the petitioner's side, shall bear the burden of proof as to every ground on which each such party relies to sustain such party's position that such plan does not qualify. If the Commissioner has failed to issue a notice of determination, then&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the petitioner who contends that the retirement plan does qualify, and any party joining or intervening on the petitioner's side, shall bear the burden of proof as to the jurisdictional requirements described in Rule 210(c) and also with respect to the date on which the request for determination, if any, was mailed to the Internal Revenue Service and the office to which it was mailed, and that the notice of determination has been issued by the Commissioner; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the petitioner who contends that the retirement plan does not qualify, and any party joining or intervening on the petitioner's side, shall bear the burden of proof as to the matters set forth in subparagraph (1)(A)(i) of this paragraph (c) and also as to the grounds and supporting facts on which each such party relies for such party's claim that the plan does not qualify.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <em>Parties Respondent:</em> The burden of proof shall be upon the respondent, and upon any party joining or intervening on the respondent's side, as to any ground not stated in the notice of determination upon which either relies to sustain the respondent's determination that a retirement plan does not qualify. If the respondent has not issued a notice of determination, then the respondent, and any party joining or intervening on the respondent's side, shall bear the burden of proof as to every ground upon which either relies to sustain the position that such plan does not qualify. See also subparagraph (1)(A)(ii) of this paragraph (c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Other Actions:</em> (A) <em>Petitioner:</em> The burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner as to jurisdictional requirements and as to the grounds set forth in the notice of determination. If the Commissioner has failed to issue a notice of determination, then the burden of proof shall be on the petitioner with respect to jurisdictional requirements, and also with respect to the date on which the request for determination, if any, was mailed to the Internal Revenue Service and the office to which it was mailed, and that no notice of determination has been issued by the Commissioner.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:45 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <em>Respondent:</em> The burden of proof shall be upon the respondent as to any ground upon which the respondent relies and which is not stated in the notice of determination. If the respondent has not issued a notice of determination, then the respondent shall bear the burden of proof as to every ground relied upon to sustain the respondent's position, other than those matters as to which the burden is on the petitioner under subparagraph (2)(A) of this paragraph (c) where such a notice is not issued.</p>
