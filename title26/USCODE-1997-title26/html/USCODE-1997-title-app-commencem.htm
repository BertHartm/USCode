<h3 class="section-head">Rule 20. Commencement of Case</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General:</strong> A case is commenced in the Court by filing a petition with the Court to redetermine a deficiency set forth in a notice of deficiency issued by the Commissioner, or to redetermine the liability of a transferee or fiduciary set forth in a notice of liability issued by the Commissioner to the transferee or fiduciary, or to obtain a declaratory judgment, or to obtain or restrain a disclosure, or to adjust or readjust partnership items, or to obtain an award for reasonable administrative costs. See Rule 13, Jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Filing Fee:</strong> At the time of filing a petition, a fee of $60 shall be paid. The payment of any fee under this paragraph may be waived if the petitioner establishes to the satisfaction of the Court by an affidavit containing specific financial information the inability to make such payment.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 21. Service of Papers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) When Required:</strong> Except as otherwise required by these Rules or directed by the Court, all pleadings, motions, orders, decisions, notices, demands, briefs, appearances, or other similar documents or papers relating to a case, including a disciplinary matter under Rule 202, also referred to as the papers in a case, shall be served on each of the parties or other persons involved in the matter to which the paper relates other than the party who filed the paper.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Manner of Service:</strong> (1) <em>General:</em> All petitions shall be served by the Clerk. All other papers required to be served on a party shall also be served by the Clerk unless otherwise provided in these Rules or directed by the Court, or unless the original paper is filed with a certificate by a party or a party's counsel that service of that paper has been made on the party to be served or such party's counsel. For the form of such certificate of service, see Form 13, Appendix I. Such service may be made by mail directed to the party or the party's counsel at such person's last known address. Service by mail is complete upon mailing, and the date of such mailing shall be the date of such service. As an alternative to service by mail, service may be made by delivery to a party, or a party's counsel or authorized representative in the case of a party other than an individual (see Rule 24(b)). Service shall be made on the Commissioner by service on, or directed to, the Commissioner's counsel at the office address shown in the Commissioner's answer filed in the case or, if no answer has been filed, on the Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. 20224. Service on a person other than a party shall be made in the same manner as service on a party, except as otherwise provided in these Rules or directed by the Court. In cases consolidated pursuant to Rule 141, a party making direct service of a paper shall serve each of the other parties or counsel for each of the other parties, and the original and copies thereof required to be filed with the Court shall each have a certificate of service attached.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Counsel of Record:</em> Whenever under these Rules service is required or permitted to be made upon a party represented by counsel who has entered an appearance, service shall be made upon such counsel unless service upon the party is directed by the Court. Where more than one counsel appear for a party, service will be made only on that counsel whose appearance was first entered of record, unless that counsel notifies the Court, by a designation of counsel to receive service filed with the Court, that other counsel of record is to receive service, in which event service will be made only on the person so designated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Writs and Process:</em> Service and execution of writs, process, or similar directives of the Court may be made by a United States marshal, by a deputy marshal, or by a person specially appointed by the Court for that purpose, except that a subpoena may be served as provided in Rule 147(c). The person making service shall make proof thereof to the Court promptly and in any event within the time in which the person served must respond. Failure to make proof of <!-- PDFPage:5 -->service does not affect the validity of the service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <em>Change of Address:</em> The Court shall be promptly notified, by a notice of change of address filed with the Court, of the change of mailing address of any party, any party's counsel, or any party's duly authorized representative in the case of a party other than an individual (see Rule 24(a)(2),(3), and (b)). A separate notice of change of address shall be filed for each docket number.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Signature:</em> The original signature, either of the party or the party's counsel, shall be subscribed in writing to the original of every paper filed by or for that party with the Court, except as otherwise provided by these Rules. An individual rather than a firm name shall be used, except that the signature of a petitioner corporation or unincorporated association shall be in the name of the corporation or association by one of its active and authorized officers or members, as for example &ldquo;Mary Doe, Inc., by Richard Roe, President.&rdquo; The name, mailing address, and telephone number of the party or the party's counsel, as well as counsel's Tax Court bar number, shall be typed or printed immediately beneath the written signature. The mailing address of a signatory shall include a firm name if it is an essential part of the accurate mailing address.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Number Filed:</strong> For each paper filed in Court, there shall be filed four conformed copies together with the signed original thereof, except as otherwise provided in these Rules. Where filing is in more than one case (as a motion to consolidate, or in cases already consolidated), the number filed shall include one additional copy for each docket number in excess of one. As to stipulations, see Rule 91(b).</p>

All papers, whether typed or printed, shall have an inside margin not less than one-fourth inch wide.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Binding and Covers:</strong> All papers shall be bound together on the upper left-hand side only and shall have no backs or covers.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 24. Appearance and Representation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Appearance:</strong> (1) <em>General:</em> Counsel may enter an appearance either by subscribing the petition or other initial pleading or document in accordance with subparagraph (2) hereof, or thereafter by filing an entry of appearance in accordance with subparagraph (3) hereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Appearance in Initial Pleading:</em> If (A) the petition or other paper initiating the participation of a party in a case is subscribed by counsel admitted to practice before the Court, and (B) such initial paper contains the mailing address and Tax Court bar number of counsel and other information required for entry of appearance (see subparagraph (3)), then (C) that counsel shall be recognized as representing that party and no separate entry of appearance shall be necessary. Thereafter counsel shall be required to notify the Clerk of any changes in applicable information to the same extent as if counsel had filed a separate entry of appearance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Subsequent Appearance:</em> Where counsel has not previously appeared, counsel shall file an entry of appearance in duplicate, signed by counsel individually, containing the name and docket number of the case, the name, mailing address, telephone number, and Tax Court bar number of counsel so appearing, and a statement that counsel is admitted to practice before the Court. A separate entry of appearance, in duplicate, shall be filed for each additional docket number in which counsel shall appear. The entry of appearance shall be substantially in the form set forth in Appendix I. The Clerk shall be given prompt written notice, filed in duplicate for each docket number, of any change in the foregoing information. An entry of appearance shall not be joined to or made part of a motion to withdraw as counsel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <em>Counsel Not Admitted to Practice:</em> No entry of appearance by counsel not admitted to practice before this Court will be effective until counsel shall have been admitted, but counsel may be recognized as counsel in a pending case to the <!-- PDFPage:6 -->extent permitted by the Court and then only where it appears that counsel can and will be promptly admitted. For the procedure for admission to practice before the Court, see Rule 200.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Personal Representation Without Counsel:</strong> In the absence of appearance by counsel, a party will be deemed to appear on the party's own behalf. An individual party may represent himself or herself. A corporation or an unincorporated association may be represented by an authorized officer of the corporation or by an authorized member of the association. An estate or trust may be represented by a fiduciary thereof. Any such person shall state, in the initial pleading or other paper filed by or for the party, such person's name, address, and telephone number, and thereafter shall promptly notify the Clerk in writing, in duplicate for each docket number involving that party, of any change in that information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Withdrawal of Counsel:</strong> Counsel of record desiring to withdraw such counsel's appearance, or any party desiring to withdraw the appearance of counsel of record for such party, must file a motion with the Court requesting leave therefor, showing that prior notice of the motion has been given by such counsel to such counsel's client, or such party's counsel, as the case may be, and to each of the other parties to the case or their counsel, and stating whether there is any objection to the motion. A motion to withdraw as counsel and a motion to withdraw counsel shall each also state the then current mailing address and telephone number of the party in respect of whom or by whom the motion is filed. A motion to withdraw as counsel shall not be joined to or made part of an entry of appearance. The Court may, in its discretion, deny such motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Death of Counsel:</strong> If counsel of record dies, the Court shall be so notified, and other counsel may enter an appearance in accordance with this Rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Change in Party or Authorized Representative or Fiduciary:</strong> Where (1) a party other than an individual participates in a case through an authorized representative (such as an officer of a corporation or a member of an association) or through a fiduciary, and there is a change in such representative or fiduciary, or (2) there is a substitution of parties in a pending case, counsel subscribing the motion resulting in the Court's approval of the change or substitution shall thereafter be deemed first counsel of record for the representative, fiduciary, or party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Conflict of Interest:</strong> If any counsel of record (1) was involved in planning or promoting a transaction or operating an entity that is connected to any issue in a case, (2) represents more than one person with differing interests with respect to any issue in a case, or (3) is a potential witness in a case, then such counsel must either secure the informed consent of the client (but only as to items (1) and (2)); withdraw from the case; or take whatever other steps are necessary to obviate a conflict of interest or other violation of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and particularly Rules 1.7, 1.8, and 3.7 thereof. The Court may inquire into the circumstances of counsel's employment in order to deter such violations. See Rule 201.</p>

If service is made by mail, then a period of time computed with respect to the service shall begin on the day after the date of mailing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Saturdays, Sundays, and Holidays:</em> Saturdays, Sundays, and all legal holidays shall be counted, except that, (A) if the period prescribed or allowed is less than 7 days, then intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays in the District of Columbia shall be excluded in the computation; (B) if the last day of the period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia, then that day shall not be included and the period shall run until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or such a legal holiday; and (C) if any act is required to be taken or completed no later than (or at least) a specified number of days before a date certain, then the earliest day of the period so specified shall not be included if it is a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia, and the earliest such day shall be the next preceding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or such a legal holiday. When such a legal holiday falls on a Sunday, the next day shall be considered a holiday; and, when such a legal holiday falls on a Saturday, the preceding day shall be considered a holiday.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Cross-references:</em> For computation of the period within which to file a petition with the Court to redetermine a deficiency or liability, see Code Section 6213; for the period within which to file a petition in a declaratory judgment action, see Code Sections 7428, 7476, and 7478; for the period within which to file a petition in a disclosure action, see Code Section 6110; and for the period within which to file a petition in a partnership action, see Code Sections 6226 and 6228.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Enlargement or Reduction of Time:</strong> Unless precluded by statute, the Court in its discretion <!-- PDFPage:7 -->may make longer or shorter any period provided by these Rules. As to continuances, see Rule 134. Where a motion is made concerning jurisdiction or the sufficiency of a pleading, the time for filing a response to that pleading shall begin to run from the date of service of the order disposing of the motion by the Court, unless the Court shall direct otherwise. Where the dates for filing briefs are fixed, an extension of time for filing a brief or the granting of leave to file a brief after the due date shall correspondingly extend the time for filing any other brief due at the same time and for filing succeeding briefs, unless the Court shall order otherwise. The period fixed by statute, within which to file a petition with the Court to redetermine a deficiency or liability, cannot be extended by the Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Miscellaneous:</strong> With respect to the computation of time, see also Rule 3(e) (definition), Rule 10(d) (business hours of the Court), Rule 13(c) (filing of petition), and Rule 134 (continuances).</p>
