<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Amendments:</strong> Amendments to these Rules shall state their effective date. Amendments shall likewise govern all proceedings both in cases pending on or commenced after their effective date, except to the extent otherwise provided, and subject to the further exception provided in paragraph (a) of this Rule.</p>
