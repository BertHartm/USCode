<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Rules in this Title apply according to their terms to written interrogatories (Rule 71), production of documents or things (Rule 72), examination by transferees (Rule 73), depositions (Rules 74, 75, 76, 81, 82, 83, and 84), and requests for admission (Rule 90). Such procedures may be used in anticipation of the stipulation of facts required by Rule 91, but the existence of such procedures or their use does not excuse failure to comply with the requirements of that Rule. See Rule 91(a)(2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Unless the Court orders otherwise for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the interests of justice, and subject to the provisions of the Rules herein which apply more specifically, the procedures set forth in Rule 100 may be used in any sequence, and the fact that <!-- PDFPage:26 -->a party is engaged in any such method or procedure shall not operate to delay the use of any such method or procedure by any other party. However, none of these methods or procedures shall be used in a manner or at a time which shall delay or impede the progress of the case toward trial status or the trial of the case on the date for which it is noticed, unless in the interests of justice the Court shall order otherwise. Unless the Court orders otherwise under Rule 103, the frequency of use of these methods or procedures is not limited.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">A party who has responded to a request for discovery (under Rules 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, or 76) or to a request for admission (under Rule 90) in a manner which was complete when made, is under no duty to supplement the response to include information thereafter acquired, except as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A party is under a duty seasonably to supplement the response with respect to any matter directly addressed to (A) the identity and location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters, and (B) the identity of each person expected to be called as an expert witness at trial, the subject matter on which such person is expected to testify, and the substance of such person's testimony. In respect of the requirement to furnish reports of expert witnesses, see Rule 143(f)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A party is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response if the party obtains information upon the basis of which the party knows that (A) the response was incorrect when made, or (B) the response, though correct when made, is no longer true and the circumstances are such that a failure to amend the response is in substance a knowing concealment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order of the Court, agreement of the parties, or at any time prior to trial through new requests for supplementation of prior responses.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) That a method or procedure be used other than the one selected by the party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) That certain matters not be inquired into, or that the method be limited to certain matters or to any other extent.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 104. Enforcement Action and Sanctions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Failure to Attend Deposition or to Answer Interrogatories or Respond to Request for Inspection or Production:</strong> If a party, or an officer, director, or managing agent of a party, or a person designated in accordance with Rule 74(b), 75(c), or 81(c) to testify on behalf of a party fails (1) to appear before the officer who is to take such person's deposition pursuant to Rule 74, 75, 76, 81, 82, 83, or 84, or (2) to serve answers or objections to interrogatories submitted under Rule 71, after proper service thereof, or (3) to serve a written response to a request for production or inspection submitted under Rule 72 or 73 after proper service of the request, then the Court on motion may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others it may take any action authorized under paragraph (b) or (c) of this Rule. If any person, after being served with a subpoena or having waived such service, willfully fails to appear before the officer who is to take such person's deposition or refuses to be sworn, or if any person willfully fails to obey an order requiring such person to answer designated interrogatories or questions, then such failure may be considered contempt of court. The failure to act described in this paragraph (a) may not be excused on the ground that the deposition sought, or the interrogatory submitted, or the production or inspection sought, is objectionable, unless the party failing to act has theretofore raised the objection, or has applied for a protective order under Rule 103, with respect thereto at the proper time and in the proper manner, and the Court has either sustained or granted or not yet ruled on the objection or the application for the order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Failure to Answer:</strong> If a person fails to answer a question or interrogatory propounded or submitted in accordance with Rule 71, 74, 75, 76, 81, 82, 83, or 84, or fails to respond to a request to produce or inspect or fails to produce or permit the inspection in accordance with Rule 72 or 73, or fails to make a designation in accordance <!-- PDFPage:27 -->with Rule 74(b), 75(e), or 81(c), the aggrieved party may, within the time for completion of discovery under Rule 70(a)(2), move the Court for an order compelling an answer, response, or compliance with the request, as the case may be. When taking a deposition on oral examination, the examination may be completed on other matters or the examination adjourned, as the proponent of the question may prefer, before applying for such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Sanctions:</strong> If a party or an officer, director, or managing agent of a party or a person designated in accordance with Rule 74(b), 75(c), or 81(c) fails to obey an order made by the Court with respect to the provisions of Rule 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 81, 82, 83, 84, or 90, then the Court may make such orders as to the failure as are just, and among others the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) An order that the matter regarding which the order was made or any other designated facts shall be taken to be established for the purposes of the case in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) An order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose designated claims or defenses, or prohibiting such party from introducing designated matters in evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) An order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed, or dismissing the case or any part thereof, or rendering a judgment by default against the disobedient party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) In lieu of the foregoing orders or in addition thereto, the Court may treat as a contempt of the Court the failure to obey any such order, and the Court may also require the party failing to obey the order or counsel advising such party, or both, to pay the reasonable expenses, including counsel's fees, caused by the failure, unless the Court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Evasive or Incomplete Answer or Response:</strong> For purposes of this Rule and Rules 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 81, 82, 83, 84, and 90, an evasive or incomplete answer or response is to be treated as a failure to answer or respond.</p>
