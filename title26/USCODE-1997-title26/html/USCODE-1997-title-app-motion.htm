<h3 class="section-head">Rule 50. General Requirements</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Form and Content of Motion:</strong> An application to the Court for an order shall be by motion in writing, which shall state with particularity the grounds therefor and shall set forth the relief or order sought. The motion shall show that prior notice thereof has been given to each other party or counsel for each other party and shall state whether there is any objection to the motion. If a motion does not include such a statement, the Court will assume that there is an objection to the motion. Unless the Court directs otherwise, motions made during a hearing or trial need not be in writing. The rules applicable to captions, signing, and other matters of form and style of pleadings apply to all written motions. See Rules 23, 32, and 33.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Disposition of Motions:</strong> A motion may be disposed of in one or more of the following ways, in the discretion of the Court:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Court may take action after directing that a written response be filed. In that event, the motion shall be served upon the opposing party, who shall file such response within such period as the Court may direct. Written response to a motion shall conform to the same requirements of form and style as apply to motions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Court may take action after directing a hearing, which normally will be held in Washington, D.C. The Court may, on its own motion or upon the written request of any party to the motion, direct that the hearing be held at some other location which serves the convenience of the parties and the Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Court may take such action as the Court in its discretion deems appropriate, on such prior notice, if any, which the Court may consider reasonable. The action of the Court may be taken with or without written response, hearing, or attendance of a party to the motion at the hearing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Attendance at Hearings:</strong> If a motion is noticed for hearing, then a party to the motion may, prior to or at the time for such hearing, submit a written statement of such party's position together with any supporting documents. Such statement may be submitted in lieu of or in addition to attendance at the hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Defects in Pleading:</strong> Where the motion or order is directed to defects in a pleading, prompt filing of a proper pleading correcting the defects may obviate the necessity of a hearing thereon.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Postponement of Trial:</strong> The filing of a motion shall not constitute cause for postponement of a trial. With respect to motions for continuance, see Rule 134.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Service of Motions:</strong> The rules applicable to service of pleadings apply to service of motions. See Rule 21.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General:</strong> If a pleading to which a responsive pleading is permitted or required is so vague or ambiguous that a party cannot reasonably be required to frame a responsive pleading, then the party may move for a more definite statement before interposing a responsive pleading. The motion shall point out the defects complained of and the details desired. See Rules 70 and 90 for procedures available to narrow the issues or to elicit further information as to the facts involved or the positions of the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Penalty for Failure of Response:</strong> The Court may strike the pleading to which the motion is directed or may make such other order as it deems just, if the required response is not made within such period as the Court may direct.</p>
