<h3 class="section-head">&sect;551. Foreign personal holding company income taxed to United States shareholders</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The undistributed foreign personal holding company income of a foreign personal holding company shall be included in the gross income of the citizens or residents of the United States, domestic corporations, domestic partnerships, and estates or trusts (other than foreign estates or trusts), who are shareholders in such foreign personal holding company (hereinafter called &ldquo;United States shareholders&rdquo;) in the manner and to the extent set forth in this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount included in gross income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each United States shareholder, who was a shareholder on the day in the taxable year of the company which was the last day on which a United States group (as defined in section 552(a)(2)) existed with respect to the company, shall include in his gross income, as a dividend, for the taxable year in which or with which the <!-- PDFPage:1197 -->taxable year of the company ends, the amount he would have received as a dividend (determined as if any distribution in liquidation actually made in such taxable year had not been made) if on such last day there had been distributed by the company, and received by the shareholders, an amount which bears the same ratio to the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the company for the taxable year as the portion of such taxable year up to and including such last day bears to the entire taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Information in return</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every United States shareholder who is required under subsection (b) to include in his gross income any amount with respect to the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of a foreign personal holding company and who, on the last day on which a United States group existed with respect to the company, owned 5 percent or more in value of the outstanding stock of such company, shall set forth in his return in complete detail the gross income, deductions and credits, taxable income, foreign personal holding company, and undistributed foreign personal holding company income of such company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effect on capital account of foreign personal holding company</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An amount which bears the same ratio to the undistributed foreign personal holding company income of the foreign personal holding company for its taxable year as the portion of such taxable year up to and including the last day on which a United States group existed with respect to the company bears to the entire taxable year, shall, for the purpose of determining the effect of distributions in subsequent taxable years by the corporation, be considered as paid-in surplus or as a contribution to capital, and the accumulated earnings and profits as of the close of the taxable year shall be correspondingly reduced, if such amount or any portion thereof is required to be included as a dividend, directly or indirectly, in the gross income of United States shareholders.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Basis of stock in hands of shareholders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount required to be included in the gross income of a United States shareholder under subsection (b) shall, for the purpose of adjusting the basis of his stock with respect to which the distribution would have been made (if it had been made), be treated as having been reinvested by the shareholder as a contribution to the capital of the corporation; but only to the extent to which such amount is included in his gross income in his return, increased or decreased by any adjustment of such amount in the last determination of the shareholder's tax liability, made before the expiration of 6 years after the date prescribed by law for filing the return.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Stock held through foreign entity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, stock of a foreign personal holding company owned (directly or through the application of this subsection) by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a foreign partnership or an estate or trust which is a foreign estate or trust, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a foreign corporation which is not a foreign personal holding company,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be considered as being owned proportionately by its partners, beneficiaries, or shareholders. In any case to which the preceding sentence applies, the Secretary may by regulations provide that rules similar to the rules of section 1298(b)(5) shall apply, and provide for such other adjustments in the application of this subchapter as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Coordination with passive foreign investment company provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, but for this subsection, an amount would be included in the gross income of any person under subsection (a) and under section 1293 (relating to current taxation of income from certain passive foreign investment companies), such amount shall be included in the gross income of such person only under subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Cross references</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>(1) For basis of stock or securities in a foreign personal holding company acquired from a decedent, see section 1014(b)(5).</strong></p>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>(2) For period of limitation on assessment and collection without assessment, in case of failure to include in gross income the amount properly includible therein under subsection (b), see section 6501.</strong></p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">At least 60 percent of its gross income (as defined in section 555(a)) for the taxable year is foreign personal holding company income as defined in section 553; but if the corporation is a foreign personal holding company with respect to any taxable year ending after August 26, 1937, then, for each subsequent taxable year, the minimum percentage shall be 50 percent in lieu of 60 percent, until a taxable year during the whole of which the stock ownership required by paragraph (2) does not exist, or until the expiration of three consecutive taxable years in each of which less than 50 percent of the gross income is foreign personal holding company income. For purposes of this paragraph, there shall be included in the gross income the amount includible therein as a dividend by reason of the application of section 555(c)(2); and</p>

If the Secretary is satisfied that such corporation is not so formed or availed of, he shall issue to such corporation annually or at other periodic intervals a certification that the corporation is not a foreign personal holding company.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Each United States shareholder of a foreign corporation which would, except for the provisions of paragraph (2), be a foreign personal holding company, shall attach to and file with his income tax return for the taxable year a copy of the certification by the Secretary made pursuant to paragraph (2).

<p class="statutory-body-1em">There shall be allowed as a deduction Federal income and excess profits taxes and income, war profits, and excess-profits taxes of foreign countries and possessions of the United States (to the extent not allowable as a deduction under section 275(a)(4)), accrued during the taxable year, but not including the accumulated earnings tax imposed by section 531, the personal holding company tax imposed by section 541, or the taxes imposed by corresponding sections of a prior income tax law.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Expenses and depreciation applicable to property of the taxpayer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The aggregate of the deductions allowed under section 162 (relating to trade or business expenses) and section 167 (relating to depreciation) which are allocable to the operation and maintenance of property owned or operated by the company, shall be allowed only in an amount equal to the rent or other compensation received for the use of, or the right to use, the property, unless it is established (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) to the satisfaction of the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that the rent or other compensation received was the highest obtainable, or, if none was received, that none was obtainable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that the property was held in the course of a business carried on bona fide for profit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) either that there was reasonable expectation that the operation of the property would result in a profit, or that the property was necessary to the conduct of the business.</p>
