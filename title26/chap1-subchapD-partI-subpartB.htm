<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any change in an accrual rate which does not apply to any individual who is or could be a participant in the current year shall be disregarded;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the fact that benefits under the plan may be payable to certain employees before normal retirement age shall be disregarded; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after the current year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Fractional rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A defined benefits plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the accrued benefit to which any participant is entitled upon his separation from the service is not less than a fraction of the annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age to which he would be entitled under the plan as in effect on the date of his separation if he continued to earn annually until normal retirement age the same rate of compensation upon which his normal retirement benefit would be computed under the plan, determined as if he had attained normal retirement age on the date on which any such determination is made (but taking into account no more than the 10 years of service immediately preceding his separation from service). Such fraction shall be a fraction, not exceeding 1, the numerator of which is the total number of his years of participation in the plan (as of the date of his separation from the service) and the denominator of which is the total number of years he would have participated in the plan if he separated from the service at the normal retirement age. For purposes of this subparagraph, social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Accrual for service before effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) shall not apply with respect to years of participation before the first plan year to which this section applies, but a defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this subparagraph with respect to such years of participation only if the accrued benefit of any participant with respect to such years of participation is not less than the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) his accrued benefit determined under the plan, as in effect from time to time prior to September 2, 1974, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an accrued benefit which is not less than one-half of the accrued benefit to which such participant would have been entitled if subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) applied with respect to such years of participation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) First two years of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph, a plan shall not be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph solely because the accrual of benefits under the plan does not become effective until the employee has two continuous years of service. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;years of service&rdquo; has the meaning provided by section 410(a)(3)(A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Certain insured defined benefit plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C), a defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if such plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is funded exclusively by the purchase of insurance contracts, and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:826 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 412(i) (relating to certain insurance contract plans),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">but only if an employee's accrued benefit as of any applicable date is not less than the cash surrender value his insurance contracts would have on such applicable date if the requirements of paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of section 412(i) were satisfied.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Accrued benefit may not decrease on account of increasing age or service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if the participant's accrued benefit is reduced on account of any increase in his age or service. The preceding sentence shall not apply to benefits under the plan commencing before entitlement to benefits payable under title II of the Social Security Act which benefits under the plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) do not exceed such social security benefits, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) terminate when such social security benefits commence.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(H) Continued accrual beyond normal retirement age</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, an employee's benefit accrual is ceased, or the rate of an employee's benefit accrual is reduced, because of the attainment of any age.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Certain limitations permitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subparagraph solely because the plan imposes (without regard to age) a limitation on the amount of benefits that the plan provides or a limitation on the number of years of service or years of participation which are taken into account for purposes of determining benefit accrual under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Adjustments under plan for delayed retirement taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of any employee who, as of the end of any plan year under a defined benefit plan, has attained normal retirement age under such plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has commenced as of the end of such plan year, then any requirement of this subparagraph for continued accrual of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee during such plan year shall be treated as satisfied to the extent of the actuarial equivalent of inservice distribution of benefits, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has not commenced as of the end of such year in accordance with section 401(a)(14)(C), and the payment of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee is not suspended during such plan year pursuant to subsection (a)(3)(B), then any requirement of this subparagraph for continued accrual of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee during such plan year shall be treated as satisfied to the extent of any adjustment in the benefit payable under the plan during such plan year attributable to the delay in the distribution of benefits after the attainment of normal retirement age.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;The preceding provisions of this clause shall apply in accordance with regulations of the Secretary. Such regulations may provide for the application of the preceding provisions of this clause, in the case of any such employee, with respect to any period of time within a plan year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Disregard of subsidized portion of early retirement benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) solely because the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit is disregarded in determining benefit accruals.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(v) Coordination with other requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall provide by regulation for the coordination of the requirements of this subparagraph with the requirements of subsection (a), sections 404, 410, and 415, and the provisions of this subchapter precluding discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Defined contribution plans</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A defined contribution plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, allocations to the employee's account are not ceased, and the rate at which amounts are allocated to the employee's account is not reduced, because of the attainment of any age.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Application to target benefit plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall provide by regulation for the application of the requirements of this paragraph to target benefit plans.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Separate accounting required in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of the defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for the portion of each employee's accrued benefit derived from any voluntary employee contributions permitted under the plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of any plan which is not a defined benefit plan, the plan requires sepa<!-- PDFPage:827 -->rate accounting for each employee's accrued benefit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Year of participation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of determining an employee's accrued benefit, the term &ldquo;year of participation&rdquo; means a period of service (beginning at the earliest date on which the employee is a participant in the plan and which is included in a period of service required to be taken into account under section 410(a)(5), determined without regard to section 410(a)(5)(E)) as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor which provide for the calculation of such period on any reasonable and consistent basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Less than full time service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, except as provided in subparagraph (C), in the case of any employee whose customary employment is less than full time, the calculation of such employee's service on any basis which provides less than a ratable portion of the accrued benefit to which he would be entitled under the plan if his customary employment were full time shall not be treated as made on a reasonable and consistent basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Less than 1,000 hours of service during year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of any employee whose service is less than 1,000 hours during any calendar year, plan year or other 12-consecutive month period designated by the plan (and not prohibited under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor) the calculation of his period of service shall not be treated as not made on a reasonable and consistent basis solely because such service is not taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Seasonal industries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any seasonal industry where the customary period of employment is less than 1,000 hours during a calendar year, the term &ldquo;year of participation&rdquo; shall be such period as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if a separate account is not maintained with respect to an employee's contributions under such a plan, the amount which bears the same ratio to his total accrued benefit as the total amount of the employee's contributions (less withdrawals) bears to the sum of such contributions and the contributions made on his behalf by the employer (less withdrawals).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Defined benefit plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a defined benefit plan, the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee as of any applicable date is the amount equal to the employee's accumulated contributions expressed as an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, using an interest rate which would be used under the plan under section 417(e)(3) (as of the determination date).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the rights of all affected employees to benefits accrued to the date of such termination, partial termination, or discontinuance, to the extent funded as of such date, or the amounts credited to the employees&rsquo; accounts, are nonforfeitable. This paragraph shall not apply to benefits or contributions which, under provisions of the plan adopted pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary to preclude the discrimination prohibited by section 401(a)(4), may not be used for designated employees in the event of early termination of the plan. For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of the complete discontinuance of contributions under a profit-sharing or stock bonus plan, such plan shall be treated as having terminated on the day on which the plan administrator notifies the Secretary (in accordance with regulations) of the discontinuance.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Treatment of voluntary employee contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a defined benefit plan which permits voluntary employee contributions, the portion of an employee's accrued benefit derived from such contributions shall be treated as an accrued benefit derived from employee contributions under a plan other than a defined benefit plan.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this section if the accrued benefit of a participant is decreased by an amendment of the plan, other than an amendment described in section 412(c)(8), or section 4281 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (h), this section applies to a plan if, for any plan year beginning on or after the effective date of this section for such plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such plan included a trust which qualified (or was determined by the Secretary to have qualified) under section 401(a), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such plan satisfied (or was determined by the Secretary to have satisfied) the requirements of section 403(a).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A plan to which this section applies shall have satisfied the minimum funding standard for such plan for a plan year if as of the end of such plan year, the plan does not have an accumulated funding deficiency. For purposes of this section and section 4971, the term &ldquo;accumulated funding deficiency&rdquo; means for any plan the excess of the total charges to the funding standard account for all plan years (beginning with the first plan year to which this section applies) over the total credits to such account for such years or, if less, the excess of the total charges to the alternative minimum funding standard account for such plan years over the total credits to such account for such years. In any plan year in which a multiemployer plan is in reorganization, the accumulated funding deficiency of the plan shall be determined under section 418B.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Funding standard account</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Account required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each plan to which this section applies shall establish and maintain a funding standard account. Such account shall be credited and charged solely as provided in this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Charges to account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be charged with the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the normal cost of the plan for the plan year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amounts necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of a plan in existence on January 1, 1974, the unfunded past service liability under the plan on the first day of the first plan year to which this section applies, over a period of 40 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a plan which comes into existence after January 1, 1974, the unfunded past service liability under the plan on the first day of the first plan year to which this section applies, over a period of 30 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net increase (if any) in unfunded past service liability under the plan arising from plan amendments adopted in such year, over a period of 30 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net experience loss (if any) under the plan, over a period of 5 plan years (15 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net loss (if any) resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used under the plan, over a period of 10 plan years (30 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the amount necessary to amortize each waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of subsection (d)(3)) for each prior plan year in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 5 plan years (15 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 5 plan years any amount credited to the funding standard account under paragraph (3)(D).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For additional requirements in the case of plans other than multiemployer plans, see subsection (<em>l</em>).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Credits to account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be credited with the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount considered contributed by the employer to or under the plan for the plan year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized)&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:834 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net decrease (if any) in unfunded past service liability under the plan arising from plan amendments adopted in such year, over a period of 30 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net experience gain (if any) under the plan, over a period of 5 plan years (15 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net gain (if any) resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used under the plan, over a period of 10 plan years (30 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the amount of the waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of subsection (d)(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#412_1_target" name="412_1">1</a></sup> for the plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in the case of a plan year for which the accumulated funding deficiency is determined under the funding standard account if such plan year follows a plan year for which such deficiency was determined under the alternative minimum funding standards, the excess (if any) of any debit balance in the funding standard account (determined without regard to this subparagraph) over any debit balance in the alternative minimum funding standard account.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Combining and offsetting amounts to be amortized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, amounts required to be amortized under paragraph (2) or paragraph (3), as the case may be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may be combined into one amount under such paragraph to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization period for all items entering into such combined amount, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may be offset against amounts required to be amortized under the other such paragraph, with the resulting amount to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization periods for all items entering into whichever of the two amounts being offset is the greater.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Interest</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The funding standard account (and items therein) shall be charged or credited (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) with interest at the appropriate rate consistent with the rate or rates of interest used under the plan to determine costs.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Required change of interest rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of determining a plan's current liability and for purposes of determining a plan's required contribution under section 412(<em>l</em>) for any plan year&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If any rate of interest used under the plan to determine cost is not within the permissible range, the plan shall establish a new rate of interest within the permissible range.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Permissible range</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">Except as provided in subclause (II), the term &ldquo;permissible range&rdquo; means a rate of interest which is not more than 10 percent above, and not more than 10 percent below, the weighted average of the rates of interest on 30-year Treasury securities during the 4-year period ending on the last day before the beginning of the plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Secretarial authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">If the Secretary finds that the lowest rate of interest permissible under subclause (I) is unreasonably high, the Secretary may prescribe a lower rate of interest, except that such rate may not be less than 80 percent of the average rate determined under subclause (I).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Assumptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Notwithstanding subsection (c)(3)(A)(i), the interest rate used under the plan shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) determined without taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations, but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) consistent with the assumptions which reflect the purchase rates which would be used by insurance companies to satisfy the liabilities under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Certain amortization charges and credits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a plan which, immediately before the date of the enactment of the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, was a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of section 414(f) as in effect immediately before such date)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any amount described in paragraph (2)(B)(ii), (2)(B)(iii), or (3)(B)(i) of this subsection which arose in a plan year beginning before such date shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 40 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the amount arose;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any amount described in paragraph (2)(B)(iv) or (3)(B)(ii) of this subsection which arose in a plan year beginning before such date shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 20 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the amount arose;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any change in past service liability which arises during the period of 3 plan years beginning on or after such date, and results from a plan amendment adopted before such date, shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 40 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the change arises; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any change in past service liability which arises during the period of 2 plan years beginning on or after such date, and results from the changing of a group of participants from one benefit level to another <!-- PDFPage:835 -->benefit level under a schedule of plan benefits which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) was adopted before such date, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) was effective for any plan participant before the beginning of the first plan year beginning on or after such date,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 40 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the change arises.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Special rules for multiemployer plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Withdrawal liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount received by a multiemployer plan in payment of all or part of an employer's withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 shall be considered an amount contributed by the employer to or under the plan. The Secretary may prescribe by regulation additional charges and credits to a multiemployer plan's funding standard account to the extent necessary to prevent withdrawal liability payments from being unduly reflected as advance funding for plan liabilities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjustments when a multiemployer plan leaves reorganization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a multiemployer plan is not in reorganization in the plan year but was in reorganization in the immediately preceding plan year, any balance in the funding standard account at the close of such immediately preceding plan year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall be eliminated by an offsetting credit or charge (as the case may be), but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall be taken into account in subsequent plan years by being amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 30 plan years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent of any accumulated funding deficiency under section 418B(a) as of the end of the last plan year that the plan was in reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Plan payments to supplemental program or withdrawal liability payment fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount paid by a plan during a plan year to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation pursuant to section 4222 of such Act or to a fund exempt under section 501(c)(22) pursuant to section 4223 of such Act shall reduce the amount of contributions considered received by the plan for the plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Interim withdrawal liability payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount paid by an employer pending a final determination of the employer's withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of title IV of such Act and subsequently refunded to the employer by the plan shall be charged to the funding standard account in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) For purposes of the full funding limitation under subsection (c)(7), unless otherwise provided by the plan, the accrued liability under a multiemployer plan shall not include benefits which are not nonforfeitable under the plan after the termination of the plan (taking into consideration section 411(d)(3)).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determinations to be made under funding method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, normal costs, accrued liability, past service liabilities, and experience gains and losses shall be determined under the funding method used to determine costs under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Valuation of assets</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section, the value of the plan's assets shall be determined on the basis of any reasonable actuarial method of valuation which takes into account fair market value and which is permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Election with respect to bonds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The value of a bond or other evidence of indebtedness which is not in default as to principal or interest may, at the election of the plan administrator, be determined on an amortized basis running from initial cost at purchase to par value at maturity or earliest call date. Any election under this subparagraph shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulations provide, shall apply to all such evidences of indebtedness, and may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary. In the case of a plan other than a multiemployer plan, this subparagraph shall not apply, but the Secretary may by regulations provide that the value of any dedicated bond portfolio of such plan shall be determined by using the interest rate under subsection (b)(5).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Actuarial assumptions must be reasonable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, all costs, liabilities, rates of interest, and other factors under the plan shall be determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions and methods&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a plan other than a multiemployer plan, each of which is reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations) or which, in the aggregate, result in a total contribution equivalent to that which would be determined if each such assumption and method were reasonable, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a multiemployer plan, which, in the aggregate, are reasonable (taking into account the experiences of the plan and reasonable expectations), and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which, in combination, offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of certain changes as experience gain or loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a change in benefits under the Social Security Act or in other retirement benefits created under Federal or State law, or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:836 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a change in the definition of the term &ldquo;wages&rdquo; under section 3121, or a change in the amount of such wages taken into account under regulations prescribed for purposes of section 401(a)(5),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">results in an increase or decrease in accrued liability under a plan, such increase or decrease shall be treated as an experience loss or gain.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Change in funding method or in plan year requires approval</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the funding method for a plan is changed, the new funding method shall become the funding method used to determine costs and liabilities under the plan only if the change is approved by the Secretary. If the plan year for a plan is changed, the new plan year shall become the plan year for the plan only if the change is approved by the Secretary.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Trusts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A trust which is a part of a pension, profitsharing, or stock bonus plan shall not constitute a qualified trust under section 401(a) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a defined benefit plan, the plan provides for the payment of benefits with respect to a participant which exceed the limitation of subsection (b),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a defined contribution plan, contributions and other additions under the plan with respect to any participant for any taxable year exceed the limitation of subsection (c), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in any case in which an individual is a participant in both a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan maintained by the employer, the trust has been disqualified under subsection (g).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Section applies to certain annuities and accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an employee annuity plan described in section 403(a),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an annuity contract described in section 403(b), or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:869 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a simplified employee pension described in section 408(k),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">such a contract, plan, or pension shall not be considered to be described in section 403(a), 403(b), or 408(k), as the case may be, unless it satisfies the requirements of subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1), whichever is appropriate, and has not been disqualified under subsection (g). In the case of an annuity contract described in section 403(b), the preceding sentence shall apply only to the portion of the annuity contract which exceeds the limitation of subsection (b) or the limitation of subsection (c), whichever is appropriate, and the amount of the contribution for such portion shall reduce the exclusion allowance as provided in section 403(b)(2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation for defined benefit plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Benefits with respect to a participant exceed the limitation of this subsection if, when expressed as an annual benefit (within the meaning of paragraph (2)), such annual benefit is greater than the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) $90,000, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 100 percent of the participant's average compensation for his high 3 years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual benefit</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;annual benefit&rdquo; means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) under a plan to which employees do not contribute and under which no rollover contributions (as defined in sections 402(c), 403(a)(4), and 408(d)(3)) are made.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjustment for certain other forms of benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the benefit under the plan is payable in any form other than the form described in subparagraph (A), or if the employees contribute to the plan or make rollover contributions (as defined in sections 402(c), 403(a)(4), and 408(d)(3)), the determinations as to whether the limitation described in paragraph (1) has been satisfied shall be made, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary by adjusting such benefit so that it is equivalent to the benefit described in subparagraph (A). For purposes of this subparagraph, any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits shall not be taken into account; and that portion of any joint and survivor annuity which constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity (as defined in section 417) shall not be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Adjustment to $90,000 limit where benefit begins before the social security retirement age</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the retirement income benefit under the plan begins before the social security retirement age, the determination as to whether the $90,000 limitation set forth in paragraph (1)(A) has been satisfied shall be made, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by reducing the limitation of paragraph (1)(A) so that such limitation (as so reduced) equals an annual benefit (beginning when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $90,000 annual benefit beginning at the social security retirement age. The reduction under this subparagraph shall be made in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe which is consistent with the reduction for old-age insurance benefits commencing before the social security retirement age under the Social Security Act.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Adjustment to $90,000 limit where benefit begins after the social security retirement age</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the retirement income benefit under the plan begins after the social security retirement age, the determination as to whether the $90,000 limitation set forth in paragraph (1)(A) has been satisfied shall be made, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by increasing the limitation of paragraph (1)(A) so that such limitation (as so increased) equals an annual benefit (beginning when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $90,000 annual benefit beginning at the social security retirement age.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Limitation on certain assumptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), for purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation under subparagraph (B) or (C), the interest rate assumption shall not be less than the greater of 5 percent or the rate specified in the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For purposes of adjusting the benefit or limitation of any form of benefit subject to section 417(e)(3), the applicable interest rate (as defined in section 417(e)(3)) shall be substituted for &ldquo;5 percent&rdquo; in clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) For purposes of adjusting any limitation under subparagraph (D), the interest rate assumption shall not be greater than the lesser of 5 percent or the rate specified in the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) For purposes of this subsection, no adjustments under subsection (d)(1) shall be taken into account before the year for which such adjustment first takes effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) For purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation under subparagraph (B), (C), or (D), the mortality table used shall be the table prescribed by the Secretary. Such table shall be based on the prevailing commissioners&rsquo; standard table (described in section 807(d)(5)(A)) used to determine reserves for group annuity contracts issued on the date the adjustment is being made (without regard to any other subparagraph of section 807(d)(5)).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Plans maintained by governments and tax-exempt organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a governmental plan (within the meaning of section 414(d)), a plan maintained by an organization (other than a governmental unit) exempt from tax under this subtitle, or a qualified merchant marine plan&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:870 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) subparagraph (C) shall be applied&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) by substituting &ldquo;age 62&rdquo; for &ldquo;social security retirement age&rdquo; each place it appears, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) as if the last sentence thereof read as follows: &ldquo;The reduction under this subparagraph shall not reduce the limitation of paragraph (1)(A) below (i) $75,000 if the benefit begins at or after age 55, or (ii) if the benefit begins before age 55, the equivalent of the $75,000 limitation for age 55.&rdquo;, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) subparagraph (D) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;age 65&rdquo; for &ldquo;social security retirement age&rdquo; each place it appears.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;qualified merchant marine plan&rdquo; means a plan in existence on January 1, 1986, the participants in which are merchant marine officers holding licenses issued by the Secretary of Transportation under title 46, United States Code.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Special limitation for qualified police or firefighters</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a qualified participant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) subparagraph (C) shall not reduce the limitation of paragraph (1)(A) to an amount less than $50,000, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the rules of subparagraph (F) shall apply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The Secretary shall adjust the $50,000 amount in clause (i) at the same time and in the same manner as under section 415(d).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(H) Qualified participant defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (G), the term &ldquo;qualified participant&rdquo; means a participant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in a defined benefit plan which is maintained by a State or political subdivision thereof,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) with respect to whom the period of service taken into account in determining the amount of the benefit under such defined benefit plan includes at least 15 years of service of the participant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) as a full-time employee of any police department or fire department which is organized and operated by the State or political subdivision maintaining such defined benefit plan to provide police protection, firefighting services, or emergency medical services for any area within the jurisdiction of such State or political subdivision, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Average compensation for high 3 years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a participant's high 3 years shall be the period of consecutive calendar years (not more than 3) during which the participant both was an active participant in the plan and had the greatest aggregate compensation from the employer. In the case of an employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting for &ldquo;compensation from the employer&rdquo; the following: &ldquo;the participant's earned income (within the meaning of section 401(c)(2) but determined without regard to any exclusion under section 911)&rdquo;.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A plan meets the requirements of section 401(a)(11) only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) under the plan, each participant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) may elect at any time during the applicable election period to waive the qualified joint and survivor annuity form of benefit or the qualified preretirement survivor annuity form of benefit (or both), and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Spouse must consent to election</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) the spouse of the participant consents in writing to such election, (ii) such election designates a beneficiary (or a form of benefits) which may not be changed without spousal consent (or the consent of the spouse expressly permits designations by the participant without any requirement of further consent by the spouse), and (iii) the spouse's consent acknowledges the effect of such election and is witnessed by a plan representative or a notary public, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) it is established to the satisfaction of a plan representative that the consent required under subparagraph (A) may not be obtained because there is no spouse, because the spouse cannot be located, or because of such other circumstances as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Any consent by a spouse (or establishment that the consent of a spouse may not be obtained) under the preceding sentence shall be effective only with respect to such spouse.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Plan to provide written explanations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Explanation of joint and survivor annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each plan shall provide to each participant, within a reasonable period of time before the annuity starting date (and consistent with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe), a written explanation of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the terms and conditions of the qualified joint and survivor annuity,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the participant's right to make, and the effect of, an election under paragraph (1) to waive the joint and survivor annuity form of benefit,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the rights of the participant's spouse under paragraph (2), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the right to make, and the effect of, a revocation of an election under paragraph (1).</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Applicable period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), the term &ldquo;applicable period&rdquo; means, with respect to a participant, whichever of the following periods ends last:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) The period beginning with the first day of the plan year in which the participant attains age 32 and ending with the close of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the participant attains age 35.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:888 --><p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) A reasonable period after the individual becomes a participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) A reasonable period ending after paragraph (5) ceases to apply to the participant.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Requirement of spousal consent for using plan assets as security for loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each plan shall provide that, if section 401(a)(11) applies to a participant when part or all of the participant's accrued benefit is to be used as security for a loan, no portion of the participant's accrued benefit may be used as security for such loan unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the spouse of the participant (if any) consents in writing to such use during the 90-day period ending on the date on which the loan is to be so secured, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The requirements of this subsection shall not apply with respect to the qualified joint and survivor annuity form of benefit or the qualified preretirement survivor annuity form of benefit, as the case may be, if such benefit may not be waived (or another beneficiary selected) and if the plan fully subsidizes the costs of such benefit.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), a plan fully subsidizes the costs of a benefit if under the plan the failure to waive such benefit by a participant would not result in a decrease in any plan benefits with respect to such participant and would not result in increased contributions from such participant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of an election to waive the qualified preretirement survivor annuity, the period which begins on the first day of the plan year in which the participant attains age 35 and ends on the date of the participant's death.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In the case of a participant who is separated from service, the applicable election period under subparagraph (B) with respect to benefits accrued before the date of such separation from service shall not begin later than such date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) which is the actuarial equivalent of a single annuity for the life of the participant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such term also includes any annuity in a form having the effect of an annuity described in the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definition of qualified preretirement survivor annuity</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the payments to the surviving spouse under such annuity are not less than the amounts which would be payable as a survivor annuity under the qualified joint and survivor annuity under the plan (or the actuarial equivalent thereof) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of a participant who dies after the date on which the participant attained the earliest retirement age, such participant had retired with an immediate qualified joint and survivor annuity on the day before the participant's date of death, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a participant who dies on or before the date on which the participant would have attained the earliest retirement age, such participant had&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) survived to the earliest retirement age,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) retired with an immediate qualified joint and survivor annuity at the earliest retirement age, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) died on the day after the day on which such participant would have attained the earliest retirement age, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) under the plan, the earliest period for which the surviving spouse may receive a payment under such annuity is not later than the month in which the participant would have attained the earliest retirement age under the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In the case of an individual who separated from service before the date of such individual's death, subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) shall not apply.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule for defined contribution plans</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Security interests taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), any security interest held by the plan by reason of a loan outstanding to the participant shall be taken into account in determining the amount of the qualified preretirement survivor annuity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Survivor annuities need not be provided if participant and spouse married less than 1 year</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), a plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of section 401(a)(11) merely because the plan provides that a qualified joint and survivor annuity (or a qualified preretirement survivor annuity) will not be provided unless the participant and spouse had been married throughout the 1-year period ending on the earlier of&mdash;</p>
