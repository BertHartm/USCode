<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7422. Civil actions for refund</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) No suit prior to filing claim for refund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected, until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Secretary, according to the provisions of law in that regard, and the regulations of the Secretary established in pursuance thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Protest or duress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such suit or proceeding may be maintained whether or not such tax, penalty, or sum has been paid under protest or duress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Suits against collection officer a bar</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A suit against any officer or employee of the United States (or former officer or employee) or his personal representative for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or of any penalty claimed to have been collected without authority, or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected shall be treated as if the United States had been a party to such suit in applying the doctrine of res judicata in all suits in respect of any internal revenue tax, and in all proceedings in the Tax Court and on review of decisions of the Tax Court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Credit treated as payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The credit of an overpayment of any tax in satisfaction of any tax liability shall, for the purpose of any suit for refund of such tax liability so satisfied, be deemed to be a payment in respect of such tax liability at the time such credit is allowed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Stay of proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary prior to the hearing of a suit brought by a taxpayer in a district court or the United States Court of Federal Claims for the recovery of any income tax, estate tax, gift tax, or tax imposed by chapter 41, 42, 43, or 44 (or any penalty relating to such taxes) mails to the taxpayer a notice that a deficiency has been determined in respect of the tax which is the subject matter of taxpayer's suit, the proceedings in taxpayer's suit shall be stayed during the period of time in which the taxpayer may file a petition with the Tax Court for a redetermination of the asserted deficiency, and for 60 days thereafter. If the taxpayer files a petition with the Tax Court, the district court or the United States Court of Federal Claims, as the case may be, shall lose jurisdiction of taxpayer's suit to whatever extent jurisdiction is acquired by the Tax Court of the subject matter of taxpayer's suit for refund. If the taxpayer does not file a petition with the Tax Court for a redetermination of the asserted deficiency, the United States may counterclaim in the taxpayer's suit, or intervene in the event of a suit as described in subsection (c) (relating to suits against officers or employees of the United States), within the period of the stay of proceedings notwithstanding that the time for such pleading may have otherwise expired. The taxpayer shall have the burden of proof with respect to the issues raised by such counterclaim or intervention of the United States except as to the issue of whether the taxpayer has been guilty of fraud with intent to evade tax. This subsection shall not apply to a suit by a taxpayer which, prior to the date of enactment of this title, is commenced, instituted, or pending in a district court or the United States Court of Federal Claims for the recovery of any income tax, estate tax, or gift tax (or any penalty relating to such taxes).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation on right of action for refund</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A suit or proceeding referred to in subsection (a) may be maintained only against the United States and not against any officer or employee of the United States (or former officer or employee) or his personal representative. Such suit or proceeding may be maintained against the United States notwithstanding the provisions of section 2502 of title 28 of the United States Code (relating to aliens&rsquo; privilege to sue) and notwithstanding the provisions of section 1502 of such title 28 (relating to certain treaty cases).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Misjoinder and change of venue</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a suit or proceeding brought in a United States district court against an officer or employee of the United States (or former officer or employee) or his personal representative is improperly brought solely by virtue of paragraph (1), the court shall order, upon such terms as are just, that the pleadings be amended to substitute the United States as a party for such officer or employee as of the time such action commenced, upon proper service of process on the United States. Such suit or proceeding shall upon request by the United States be transferred to the district or division where it should have been brought if such action initially had been brought against the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Special rules for certain excise taxes imposed by chapter 42 or 43</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Right to bring actions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to any taxable event, payment of the full amount of the first tier tax shall constitute sufficient payment in order to maintain an action under this section with respect to the second tier tax.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the terms &ldquo;taxable event&rdquo;, &ldquo;first tier tax&rdquo;, and &ldquo;second tier tax&rdquo; have the respective meanings given to such terms by section 4963.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3464 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation on suit for refund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No suit may be maintained under this section for the credit or refund of any tax imposed under section 4941, 4942, 4943, 4944, 4945, 4951, 4952, 4955, 4958, 4971, or 4975 with respect to any act (or failure to act) giving rise to liability for tax under such sections, unless no other suit has been maintained for credit or refund of, and no petition has been filed in the Tax Court with respect to a deficiency in, any other tax imposed by such sections with respect to such act (or failure to act).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Final determination of issues</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If the United States is not joined as a party, a judgment in any civil action or suit described in subsection (a) of section 2410 of title 28 of the United States Code, or a judicial sale pursuant to such a judgment, with respect to property on which the United States has or claims a lien under the provisions of this title&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall have the same effect with respect to the discharge or divestment of such lien of the United States as may be provided with respect to such matters by the local law of the place where such property is situated, if no notice of such lien has been filed in the place provided by law for such filing at the time such action or suit is commenced or if the law makes no provision for such filing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If a judicial sale of property pursuant to a judgment in any civil action or suit to which the United States is not a party discharges a lien of the United States arising under the provisions of this title, the United States may claim, with the same priority as its lien had against the property sold, the proceeds (exclusive of costs) of such sale at any time before the distribution of such proceeds is ordered.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Other sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding subsection (a) sale of property on which the United States has or claims a lien, or a title derived from enforcement of a lien, under the provisions of this title, made pursuant to an instrument creating a lien on such property, pursuant to a confession of judgment on the obligation secured by such an instrument, or pursuant to a nonjudicial sale under a statutory lien on such property&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall, except as otherwise provided, be made subject to and without disturbing such lien or title, if notice of such lien was filed or such title recorded in the place provided by law for such filing or recording more than 30 days before such sale and the United States is not given notice of such sale in the manner prescribed in subsection (c)(1); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall have the same effect with respect to the discharge or divestment of such lien or such title of the United States, as may be provided with respect to such matters by the local law of the place where such property is situated, if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the law makes no provision for such filing, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) notice of such sale is given in the manner prescribed in subsection (c)(1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice of sale</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consent to sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the notice requirement of subsection (b)(2)(C), a sale described in subsection (b) of property shall discharge or divest such property of the lien or title of the United States if the United States consents to the sale of such property free of such lien or title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Sale of perishable goods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the notice requirement of subsection (b)(2)(C), a sale described in subsection (b) of property liable to perish or become greatly reduced in price or value by keeping, or which cannot be kept without great expense, shall discharge or divest such property of the lien or title of the United States if notice of such sale is given (in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary) in writing, by registered or certified mail or by personal service, to the Secretary before such sale. The proceeds (exclusive of costs) of such sale shall be held as a fund subject to the liens and claims of the United States, in the same manner and with the same priority as such liens and claims had with respect to the property sold, for not less than 30 days after the date of such sale.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Forfeitures of land sales contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (b), a sale of property includes any forfeiture of a land sales contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Redemption by United States</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Right to redeem</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a sale of real property to which subsection (b) applies to satisfy a lien prior to that of the United States, the Secretary may redeem such property within the period of 120 days from the date of such sale or the period allowable for redemption under local law, whichever is longer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount to be paid</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which the United States redeems real property pursuant to paragraph (1), the amount to be paid for such property shall be the amount prescribed by subsection (d) of section 2410 of title 28 of the United States Code.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certificate of redemption</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case in which real property is redeemed by the United States pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary shall apply to the officer designated by local law, if any, for the documents necessary to evidence the fact of redemption and to record title to such property in the name of the United States. If no such officer is designated by local law or if such officer fails to issue such documents, the Secretary shall execute a certificate of redemption therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Filing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall, without delay, cause such documents or certificate to be duly re<!-- PDFPage:3468 -->corded in the proper registry of deeds. If the State in which the real property redeemed by the United States is situated has not by law designated an office in which such certificate may be recorded, the Secretary shall file such certificate in the office of the clerk of the United States district court for the judicial district in which such property is situated.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A certificate of redemption executed by the Secretary shall constitute prima facie evidence of the regularity of such redemption and shall, when recorded, transfer to the United States all the rights, title, and interest in and to such property acquired by the person from whom the United States redeems such property by virtue of the sale of such property.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a levy has been made on property or property has been sold pursuant to a levy, and any person (other than the person against whom is assessed the tax out of which such levy arose) who claims an interest in or lien on such property and that such property was wrongfully levied upon may bring a civil action against the United States in a district court of the United States. Such action may be brought without regard to whether such property has been surrendered to or sold by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Surplus proceed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If property has been sold pursuant to a levy, any person (other than the person against whom is assessed the tax out of which such levy arose) who claims an interest in or lien on such property junior to that of the United States and to be legally entitled to the surplus proceeds of such sale may bring a civil action against the United States in a district court of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Substituted sale proceeds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If property has been sold pursuant to an agreement described in section 6325(b)(3) (relating to substitution of proceeds of sale), any person who claims to be legally entitled to all or any part of the amount held as a fund pursuant to such agreement may bring a civil action against the United States in a district court of the United States.</p>

No other action may be brought by such person for such a determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjudication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The district court shall have jurisdiction to grant only such of the following forms of relief as may be appropriate in the circumstances:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Injunction</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Surplus proceeds</h4>

<!-- PDFPage:3469 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Substituted sale proceeds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the court determines that a party has an interest in or lien on the amount held as a fund pursuant to an agreement described in section 6325(b)(3) (relating to substitution of proceeds of sale), the court may grant a judgment in an amount equal to all or any part of the amount of such fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Substitution of value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the court determines that the Secretary's determination of the value of the interest of the United States in the property for purposes of section 6325(b)(4) exceeds the actual value of such interest, the court shall grant a judgment ordering a refund of the amount deposited, and a release of the bond, to the extent that the aggregate of the amounts thereof exceeds such value determined by the court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Validity of assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of an adjudication under this section, the assessment of tax upon which the interest or lien of the United States is based shall be conclusively presumed to be valid.</p>

Any such declaration shall have the force and effect of a decision of the Tax Court or a final judgment or decree of the district court or the Court of Federal Claims, as the case may be, and shall be reviewable as such. For purposes of this section, a determination with respect to a continuing qualification or continuing classification includes any revocation of or other change in a qualification or classification.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exhaustion of administrative remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A declaratory judgment or decree under this section shall not be issued in any proceeding unless the Tax Court, the Court of Federal Claims, or the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia determines that the organization involved has exhausted administrative remedies available to it within the Internal Revenue Service. An organization requesting the determination of an issue referred to in subsection (a)(1) shall be deemed to have exhausted its administrative remedies with respect to a failure by the Secretary to make a determination with respect to such issue at the expiration of 270 days after the date on which the request for such determination was made if the organization has taken, in a timely manner, all reasonable steps to secure such determination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a judgment of the Court of Federal Claims, has been entered,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">and such decision or judgment, as the case may be, determines that the organization was not described in section 170(c)(2),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then, notwithstanding such decision or judgment, such organization shall be treated as having been described in section 170(c)(2) for purposes of section 170 for the period beginning on the date on which the notice of the revocation was published and ending on the date on which the court first determined in such proceeding that the organization was not described in section 170(c)(2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall apply only&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Only costs allocable to the United States</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In the case of any calendar year beginning after 1996, the dollar amount referred to in clause (iii) shall be increased by an amount equal to such dollar amount multiplied by the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for such calendar year, by substituting &ldquo;calendar year 1995&rdquo; for &ldquo;calendar year 1992&rdquo; in subparagraph (B) thereof.
