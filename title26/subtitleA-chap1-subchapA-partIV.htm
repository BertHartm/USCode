<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is a person described in section 49(a)(1)(D)(iv)(II).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Financing secured by property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The requirements of this subparagraph are met with respect to any financing if such financing is secured by the qualified low-income building, except that this subparagraph shall not apply in the case of a federally assisted building described in subsection (d)(6)(B) if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the proceeds from the financing (if any) are applied to acquire or improve such building..<sup><a href="#42_6_target" name="42_6">6</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Portion of building attributable to financing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The requirements of this subparagraph are met with respect to any financing for any taxable year in the compliance period if, as of the close of such taxable year, not more than 60 percent of the eligible basis of the qualified low-income building is attributable to such financing (reduced by the principal and interest of any governmental financing which is part of a wrap-around mortgage involving such financing).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Repayment of principal and interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The requirements of this subparagraph are met with respect to any financing if such financing is fully repaid on or before the earliest of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the date of its refinancing or the sale of the building to which such financing relates.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In the case of a qualified nonprofit organization which is not described in section 49(a)(1)(D)(iv)(II) with respect to a building, clause (ii) of this subparagraph shall be applied as if the date described therein were the 90th day after the earlier of the date the building ceases to be a qualified low-income building or the date which is 15 years after the close of a compliance period with respect thereto.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Present value of financing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the rate of interest on any financing described in paragraph (2)(A) is less than the rate which is 1 percentage point below the applicable Federal rate as of the time such financing is incurred, then the qualified basis (to which such financing relates) of the qualified low-income building shall be the present value of the amount of such financing, using as the discount rate such applicable Federal rate. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the rate of interest on any financing shall be determined by treating interest to the extent of government subsidies as not payable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Failure to fully repay</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent that the requirements of paragraph (2)(D) are not met, then the taxpayer's tax under this chapter for the taxable year in which such failure occurs shall be increased by an amount equal to the applicable portion of the credit under this section with respect to such building, increased by an amount of interest for the period&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) beginning with the due date for the filing of the return of tax imposed by chapter 1 for the 1st taxable year for which such credit was allowable, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;applicable portion&rdquo; means the aggregate decrease in the credits allowed to a taxpayer under section 38 for all prior taxable years which would have resulted if the eligible basis of the building were reduced by the amount of financing which does not meet requirements of paragraph (2)(D).</p>
