<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the period for which the return is made, if a return is made for a period of less than 12 months; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1073 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in the case of a FSC or DISC filing a return for a period of at least 12 months, the period determined under subsection (h).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Annual accounting period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subtitle, the term &ldquo;annual accounting period&rdquo; means the annual period on the basis of which the taxpayer regularly computes his income in keeping his books.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Calendar year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subtitle, the term &ldquo;calendar year&rdquo; means a period of 12 months ending on December 31.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Fiscal year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subtitle, the term &ldquo;fiscal year&rdquo; means a period of 12 months ending on the last day of any month other than December. In the case of any taxpayer who has made the election provided by subsection (f) the term means the annual period (varying from 52 to 53 weeks) so elected.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Election of year consisting of 52&ndash;53 weeks</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A taxpayer who, in keeping his books, regularly computes his income on the basis of an annual period which varies from 52 to 53 weeks and ends always on the same day of the week and ends always&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) on whatever date such same day of the week last occurs in a calendar month, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on whatever date such same day of the week falls which is nearest to the last day of a calendar month,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">may (in accordance with the regulations prescribed under paragraph (3)) elect to compute his taxable income for purposes of this subtitle on the basis of such annual period. This paragraph shall apply to taxable years ending after the date of the enactment of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rules for 52&ndash;53-week year</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Effective dates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case in which the effective date or the applicability of any provision of this title is expressed in terms of taxable years beginning, including, or ending with reference to a specified date which is the first or last day of a month, a taxable year described in paragraph (1) shall (except for purposes of the computation under section 15) be treated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) as beginning with the first day of the calendar month beginning nearest to the first day of such taxable year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) as ending with the last day of the calendar month ending nearest to the last day of such taxable year,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Change in accounting period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a change from or to a taxable year described in paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if such change results in a short period (within the meaning of section 443) of 359 days or more, or of less than 7 days, section 443(b) (relating to alternative tax computation) shall not apply;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if such change results in a short period of less than 7 days, such short period shall, for purposes of this subtitle, be added to and deemed a part of the following taxable year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) if such change results in a short period to which subsection (b) of section 443 applies, the taxable income for such short period shall be placed on an annual basis for purposes of such subsection by multiplying the gross income for such short period (minus the deductions allowed by this chapter for the short period, but only the adjusted amount of the deductions for personal exemptions as described in section 443(c)) by 365, by dividing the result by the number of days in the short period, and the tax shall be the same part of the tax computed on the annual basis as the number of days in the short period is of 365 days.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule for partnerships, S corporations, and personal service corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may by regulation provide terms and conditions for the application of this subsection to a partnership, S corporation, or personal service corporation (within the meaning of section 441(i)(2)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as he deems necessary for the application of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) No books kept; no accounting period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in section 443 (relating to returns for periods of less than 12 months), the taxpayer's taxable year shall be the calendar year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the taxpayer keeps no books;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the taxpayer does not have an annual accounting period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the taxpayer has an annual accounting period, but such period does not qualify as a fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Taxable year of FSC's and DISC's</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subtitle, the taxable year of any FSC or DISC shall be the taxable year of that shareholder (or group of shareholders with the same 12-month taxable year) who has the highest percentage of voting power.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule where more than one shareholder (or group) has highest percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If 2 or more shareholders (or groups) have the highest percentage of voting power under paragraph (1), the taxable year of the FSC or DISC shall be the same 12-month period as that of any such shareholder (or group).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Subsequent changes of ownership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall prescribe regulations under which paragraphs (1) and (2) shall apply to a change of ownership of a corporation after the taxable year of the corporation has been determined under paragraph (1) or (2) only if such change is a substantial change of ownership.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Voting power determined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, voting power shall be determined on the basis of total <!-- PDFPage:1074 -->combined voting power of all classes of stock of the corporation entitled to vote.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Taxable year of personal service corporations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subtitle, the taxable year of any personal service corporation shall be the calendar year unless the corporation establishes, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, a business purpose for having a different period for its taxable year. For purposes of this paragraph, any deferral of income to shareholders shall not be treated as a business purpose.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Personal service corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;personal service corporation&rdquo; has the meaning given such term by section 269A(b)(1), except that section 269A(b)(2) shall be applied&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by substituting &ldquo;any&rdquo; for &ldquo;more than 10 percent&rdquo;, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by substituting &ldquo;any&rdquo; for &ldquo;50 percent or more in value&rdquo; in section 318(a)(2)(C).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A corporation shall not be treated as a personal service corporation unless more than 10 percent of the stock (by value) in such corporation is held by employee-owners (within the meaning of section 269A(b)(2), as modified by the preceding sentence). If a corporation is a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated return, all members of such group shall be taken into account in determining whether such corporation is a personal service corporation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Returns for short period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A return for a period of less than 12 months (referred to in this section as &ldquo;short period&rdquo;) shall be made under any of the following circumstances:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Change of annual accounting period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When the taxpayer, with the approval of the Secretary, changes his annual accounting period. In such a case, the return shall be made for the short period beginning on the day after the close of the former taxable year and ending at the close of the day before the day designated as the first day of the new taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Taxpayer not in existence for entire taxable year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When the taxpayer is in existence during only part of what would otherwise be his taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation of tax on change of annual accounting period</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a return is made under paragraph (1) of subsection (a), the taxable income for the short period shall be placed on an annual basis by multiplying the modified taxable income for such short period by 12, dividing the result by the number of months in the short period. The tax shall be the same part of the tax computed on the annual basis as the number of months in the short period is of 12 months.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Computation based on 12-month period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the taxpayer applies for the benefits of this paragraph and establishes the amount of this taxable income for the 12-month period described in subparagraph (B), computed as if that period were a taxable year and under the law applicable to that year, then the tax for the short period, computed under paragraph (1), shall be reduced to the greater of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an amount which bears the same ratio to the tax computed on the taxable income for the 12-month period as the modified taxable income computed on the basis of the short period bears to the modified taxable income for the 12-month period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the tax computed on the modified taxable income for the short period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The taxpayer (other than a taxpayer to whom subparagraph (B)(ii) applies) shall compute the tax and file his return without the application of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) 12-month period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The 12-month period referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the period of 12 months beginning on the first day of the short period, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a corporation engaged in the trade or business of farming, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a partnership engaged in the trade or business of farming, if a corporation is a partner in such partnership,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be computed on an accrual method of accounting. This section shall not apply to the trade or business of operating a nursery or sod farm or to the raising or harvesting of trees (other than fruit and nut trees).</p>

<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>For rules requiring capitalization of certain preproductive period expenses, see section 263A.</strong></p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exception for certain corporations</h4>

For purposes of the preceding sentence, all corporations which are members of the same controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1563(a)) shall be treated as 1 corporation.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Applicable percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), the term &ldquo;applicable percentage&rdquo; means the percentage equal to a fraction&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual accrual method of accounting defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;annual accrual method of accounting&rdquo; means a method under which revenues, costs, and expenses are computed on an accrual method of accounting and the preproductive period expenses incurred during the taxable year are charged to harvested crops or deducted in determining the taxable income for such years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certain nonrecognition transfers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a qualified partnership acquired substantially all the assets of a qualified farming trade or business from one of its partners in a transaction to which section 721 applies,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the transferee corporation or qualified partnership shall be deemed to have computed its taxable income on an annual accrual method of accounting during the period for which the transferor corporation or partnership computed its taxable income from such trade or business on an annual accrual method.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Basis of obligation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the obligation shall be treated as if it were disposed of in a transaction other than a sale or exchange, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the obligor and obligee are related persons (within the meaning of section 453(f)(1)), the fair market value of the obligation shall be treated as not less than its face amount.</p>

For purposes of the preceding sentence, magazines, paperbacks, and records shall each be treated as a separate category of merchandise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Qualified sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A sale of a magazine, paperback, or record is a qualified sale if&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If the initial opening balance exceeds the dollar amount of returned merchandise which would have been taken into account under <!-- PDFPage:1117 -->subsection (a) for the taxable year preceding the first taxable year for which the election is effective if this section had applied to such preceding taxable year, then an amount equal to the amount of such excess shall be included in gross income for such first taxable year.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirement that percentage of completion method be used</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Percentage of completion method</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirements of percentage of completion method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (3), in the case of any long-term contract with respect to which the percentage of completion method is used&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the percentage of completion shall be determined by comparing costs allocated to the contract under subsection (c) and incurred before the close of the taxable year with the estimated total contract costs, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) upon completion of the contract (or, with respect to any amount properly taken into account after completion of the contract, when such amount is so properly taken into account), the taxpayer shall pay (or shall be entitled to receive) interest computed under the look-back method of paragraph (2).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In the case of any long-term contract with respect to which the percentage of completion method is used, except for purposes of applying the look-back method of paragraph (2), any income under the contract (to the extent not previously includible in gross income) shall be included in gross income for the taxable year following the taxable year in which the contract was completed. For purposes of subtitle F (other than sections 6654 and 6655), any interest required to be paid by the taxpayer under subparagraph (B) shall be treated as an increase in the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the contract is completed (or, in the case of interest payable with respect to any amount properly taken into account after completion of the contract, for the taxable year in which the amount is so properly taken into account).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Look-back method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The interest computed under the look-back method of this paragraph shall be determined by&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) second, determining (solely for purposes of computing such interest) the overpayment or underpayment of tax for each taxable year referred to in subparagraph (A) which would result solely from the application of subparagraph (A), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) then using the adjusted overpayment rate (as defined in paragraph (7)), compounded daily, on the overpayment or underpayment determined under subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of the preceding sentence, any amount properly taken into account after completion of the contract shall be taken into account by discounting (using the Federal mid-term rate determined under section 1274(d) as of the time such amount was properly taken into account) such amount to its value as of the completion of the contract. The taxpayer may elect with respect to any contract to have the preceding sentence not apply to such contract.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a pass-thru entity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the look-back method of paragraph (2) shall be applied at the entity level,</p>

<!-- PDFPage:1118 --><p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) any increase in the income under the contract for any taxable year by reason of the allocation under paragraph (2)(A) shall be treated as giving rise to an underpayment determined by applying the highest rate for such year to such increase, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) any decrease in such income for any taxable year by reason of such allocation shall be treated as giving rise to an overpayment determined by applying the highest rate for such year to such decrease, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) any interest required to be paid by the taxpayer under paragraph (2) shall be paid by such entity (and any interest entitled to be received by the taxpayer under paragraph (2) shall be paid to such entity).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;461. General rule for taxable year of deduction</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of any deduction or credit allowed by this subtitle shall be taken for the taxable year which is the proper taxable year under the method of accounting used in computing taxable income.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rule in case of death</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of the death of a taxpayer whose taxable income is computed under an accrual method of accounting, any amount accrued as a deduction or credit only by reason of the death of the taxpayer shall not be allowed in computing taxable income for the period in which falls the date of the taxpayer's death.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Accrual of real property taxes</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the taxable income is computed under an accrual method of accounting, then, at the election of the taxpayer, any real property tax which is related to a definite period of time shall be accrued ratably over that period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) When election may be made</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Without consent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A taxpayer may, without the consent of the Secretary, make an election under this subsection for his first taxable year in which he incurs real property taxes. Such an election shall be made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return for such year (including extensions thereof).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) With consent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A taxpayer may, with the consent of the Secretary, make an election under this subsection at any time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on acceleration of accrual of taxes</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a taxpayer whose taxable income is computed under an accrual method of accounting, to the extent that the time for accruing taxes is earlier than it would be but for any action of any taxing jurisdiction taken after December 31, 1960, then, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, such taxes shall be treated as accruing at the time they would have accrued but for such action by such taxing jurisdiction.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1124 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, paragraph (1) shall be inapplicable to any item of tax to the extent that its application would (but for this paragraph) prevent all persons (including successors in interest) from ever taking such item into account.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Dividends or interest paid on certain deposits or withdrawable accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, amounts paid to, or credited to the accounts of, depositors or holders of accounts as dividends or interest on their deposits or withdrawable accounts (if such amounts paid or credited are withdrawable on demand subject only to customary notice to withdraw) by a mutual savings bank not having capital stock represented by shares, a domestic building and loan association, or a cooperative bank shall not be allowed as a deduction for the taxable year to the extent such amounts are paid or credited for periods representing more than 12 months. Any such amount not allowed as a deduction as the result of the application of the preceding sentence shall be allowed as a deduction for such other taxable year as the Secretary determines to be consistent with the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Contested liabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the taxpayer contests an asserted liability,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the taxpayer transfers money or other property to provide for the satisfaction of the asserted liability,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the contest with respect to the asserted liability exists after the time of the transfer, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) but for the fact that the asserted liability is contested, a deduction would be allowed for the taxable year of the transfer (or for an earlier taxable year) determined after application of subsection (h),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the deduction shall be allowed for the taxable year of the transfer. This subsection shall not apply in respect of the deduction for income, war profits, and excess profits taxes imposed by the authority of any foreign country or possession of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Prepaid interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the taxable income of the taxpayer is computed under the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, interest paid by the taxpayer which, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, is properly allocable to any period&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) with respect to which the interest represents a charge for the use or forbearance of money, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which is after the close of the taxable year in which paid,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall be charged to capital account and shall be treated as paid in the period to which so allocable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to points paid in respect of any indebtedness incurred in connection with the purchase or improvement of, and secured by, the principal residence of the taxpayer to the extent that, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, such payment of points is an established business practice in the area in which such indebtedness is incurred, and the amount of such payment does not exceed the amount generally charged in such area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Certain liabilities not incurred before economic performance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this title, in determining whether an amount has been incurred with respect to any item during any taxable year, the all events test shall not be treated as met any earlier than when economic performance with respect to such item occurs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Time when economic performance occurs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the time when economic performance occurs shall be determined under the following principles:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Services and property provided to the taxpayer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the liability of the taxpayer arises out of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the providing of services to the taxpayer by another person, economic performance occurs as such person provides such services,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the providing of property to the taxpayer by another person, economic performance occurs as the person provides such property, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the use of property by the taxpayer, economic performance occurs as the taxpayer uses such property.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Services and property provided by the taxpayer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the liability of the taxpayer requires the taxpayer to provide property or services, economic performance occurs as the taxpayer provides such property or services.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Workers compensation and tort liabilities of the taxpayer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the liability of the taxpayer requires a payment to another person and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) arises under any workers compensation act, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) arises out of any tort,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">economic performance occurs as the payments to such person are made. Subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply to any liability described in the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Other items</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any other liability of the taxpayer, economic performance occurs at the time determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exception for certain recurring items</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1) an item shall be treated as incurred during any taxable year if&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1125 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the all events test with respect to such item is met during such taxable year (determined without regard to paragraph (1)),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) economic performance with respect to such item occurs within the shorter of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) a reasonable period after the close of such taxable year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) 81/2 months after the close of such taxable year,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) such item is recurring in nature and the taxpayer consistently treats items of such kind as incurred in the taxable year in which the requirements of clause (i) are met, and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Estimates of inventory shrinkage permitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A method of determining inventories shall not be treated as failing to clearly reflect income solely because it utilizes estimates of inventory shrinkage that are confirmed by a physical count only after the last day of the taxable year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the taxpayer normally does a physical count of inventories at each location on a regular and consistent basis, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the taxpayer makes proper adjustments to such inventories and to its estimating methods to the extent such estimates are greater than or less than the actual shrinkage.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;481. Adjustments required by changes in method of accounting</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In computing the taxpayer's taxable income for any taxable year (referred to in this section as the &ldquo;year of the change&rdquo;)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if such computation is under a method of accounting different from the method under which the taxpayer's taxable income for the preceding taxable year was computed, then</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there shall be taken into account those adjustments which are determined to be necessary solely by reason of the change in order to prevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted, except there shall not be taken into account any adjustment in respect of any taxable year to which this section does not apply unless the adjustment is attributable to a change in the method of accounting initiated by the taxpayer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation on tax where adjustments are substantial</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Three year allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the method of accounting from which the change is made was used by the taxpayer in computing his taxable income for the 2 taxable years preceding the year of the change, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the increase in taxable income for the year of the change which results solely by reason of the adjustments required by subsection (a)(2) exceeds $3,000,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then the tax under this chapter attributable to such increase in taxable income shall not be greater than the aggregate increase in the taxes under this chapter (or under the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws) which would result if one-third of such increase in taxable income were included in taxable income for the year of the change and one-third of such increase were included for each of the 2 preceding taxable years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allocation under new method of accounting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the increase in taxable income for the year of the change which results solely by reason of the adjustments required by subsection (a)(2) exceeds $3,000, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the taxpayer establishes his taxable income (under the new method of accounting) for one or more taxable years consecutively preceding the taxable year of the change for which the taxpayer in computing taxable income used the method of accounting from which the change is made,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then the tax under this chapter attributable to such increase in taxable income shall not be greater than the net increase in the taxes under this chapter (or under the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws) which would result if the adjustments required by subsection (a)(2) were allocated to the taxable year or years specified in subparagraph (B) to which they are properly allocable under the new method of accounting and the balance of the adjustments required by subsection (a)(2) was allocated to the taxable year of the change.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rules for computations under paragraphs (1) and (2)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) There shall be taken into account the increase or decrease in tax for any taxable year preceding the year of the change to which no adjustment is allocated under paragraph (1) or (2) but which is affected by a net operating loss (as defined in section <!-- PDFPage:1165 -->172) or by a capital loss carryback or carryover (as defined in section 1212), determined with reference to taxable years with respect to which adjustments under paragraph (1) or (2) are allocated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The increase or decrease in the tax for any taxable year for which an assessment of any deficiency, or a credit or refund of any overpayment, is prevented by any law or rule of law, shall be determined by reference to the tax previously determined (within the meaning of section 1314(a)) for such year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) In applying section 7807(b)(1), the provisions of chapter 1 (other than subchapter E, relating to self-employment income) and chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 shall be treated as the corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjustments under regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any change described in subsection (a), the taxpayer may, in such manner and subject to such conditions as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe, take the adjustments required by subsection (a)(2) into account in computing the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year or years permitted under such regulations.</p>

Chapters 1 and 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 were comprised of sections 1 to 482 and 500 to 784, respectively, of former Title 26. Chapters 1 (except sections 143 and 144) and 2 were repealed by section 7851(a)(1) of this title. For table of comparisons of the 1939 Code to the 1986 Code, see Table I preceding section 1 of this title. See, also, section 7851(e) of this title for provision that references in the 1986 Code to a provision of the 1939 Code, not then applicable, shall be deemed a reference to the corresponding provision of the 1986 Code, which is then applicable.</p>
