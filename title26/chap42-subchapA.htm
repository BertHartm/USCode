<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Initial tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby imposed on the undistributed income of a private foundation for any taxable year, which has not been distributed before the first day of the second (or any succeeding) taxable year following such taxable year (if such first day falls within the taxable period), a tax equal to 15 percent of the amount of such income remaining undistributed at the beginning of such second (or succeeding) taxable year. The tax imposed by this subsection shall not apply to the undistributed income of a private foundation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for any taxable year for which it is an operating foundation (as defined in subsection (j)(3)), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the extent that the foundation failed to distribute any amount solely because of an incorrect valuation of assets under subsection (e), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the failure to value the assets properly was not willful and was due to reasonable cause,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such amount is distributed as qualifying distributions (within the meaning of subsection (g)) by the foundation during the allowable distribution period (as defined in subsection (j)(2)),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the foundation notifies the Secretary that such amount has been distributed (within the meaning of subparagraph (B)) to correct such failure, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) such distribution is treated under subsection (h)(2) as made out of the undistributed income for the taxable year for which a tax would (except for this paragraph) have been imposed under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which an initial tax is imposed under subsection (a) on the undistributed income of a private foundation for any taxable year, if any portion of such income remains undistributed at the close of the taxable period, there is hereby imposed a tax equal to 100 percent of the amount remaining undistributed at such time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Undistributed income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;undistributed income&rdquo; means, with respect to any <!-- PDFPage:2100 -->private foundation for any taxable year as of any time, the amount by which&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Minimum investment return</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (d), the minimum investment return for any private foundation for any taxable year is 5 percent of the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the aggregate fair market value of all assets of the foundation other than those which are used (or held for use) directly in carrying out the foundation's exempt purpose, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the acquisition indebtedness with respect to such assets (determined under section 514(c)(1) without regard to the taxable year in which the indebtedness was incurred).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Valuation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the fair market value of securities for which market quotations are readily available shall be determined on a monthly basis. For all other assets, the fair market value shall be determined at such times and in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Reductions in value for blockage or similar factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining the value of any securities under this paragraph, the fair market value of such securities (determined without regard to any reduction in value) shall not be reduced unless, and only to the extent that, the private foundation establishes that as a result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the size of the block of such securities,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the fact that the securities held are securities in a closely held corporation, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the fact that the sale of such securities would result in a forced or distress sale,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the securities could not be liquidated within a reasonable period of time except at a price less than such fair market value. Any reduction in value allowable under this subparagraph shall not exceed 10 percent of such fair market value.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Adjusted net income</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (j), the term &ldquo;adjusted net income&rdquo; means the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the gross income for the taxable year (determined with the income modifications provided by paragraph (2)), over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the sum of the deductions (determined with the deduction modifications provided by paragraph (3)) which would be allowed to a corporation subject to the tax imposed by section 11 for the taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Income modifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The income modifications referred to in paragraph (1)(A) are as follows:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) capital gains and losses from the sale or other disposition of property shall be taken into account only in an amount equal to any net short-term capital gain for the taxable year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) there shall be taken into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) amounts received or accrued as repayments of amounts which were taken into account as a qualifying distribution within the meaning of subsection (g)(1)(A) for any taxable year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) notwithstanding subparagraph (B), amounts received or accrued from the sale or other disposition of property to the extent that the acquisition of such property was taken into account as a qualifying distribution (within the meaning of subsection (g)(1)(B)) for any taxable year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) any amount set aside under subsection (g)(2) to the extent it is determined that such amount is not necessary for the purposes for which it was set aside; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) section 483 (relating to imputed interest) shall not apply in the case of a binding contract made in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) no deduction shall be allowed other than all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred for the production or collection of gross income or for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of such income and the allowances for depreciation and depletion determined under section 4940(c)(3)(B), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) section 265 (relating to expenses and interest relating to tax-exempt interest) shall not apply.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (2)(B), the basis (for purposes of determining gain) of property held by a private foundation on December 31, 1969, and continuously thereafter to the date of its disposition, shall be deemed to be not less than the fair market value of such property on December 31, 1969.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For all taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1975, subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary, an amount set aside for a specific project which comes within one or more purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B) may be treated as a qualifying distribution if it meets the requirements of subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An amount set aside for a specific project shall meet the requirements of this subparagraph if at the time of the set-aside the foundation establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the amount will be paid for the specific project within 5 years, and either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) at the time of the set-aside the private foundation establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the project is one which can better be accomplished by such set-aside than by immediate payment of funds, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii)(I) the project will not be completed before the end of the taxable year of the foundation in which the set-aside is made,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the private foundation in each taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975 (or after the end of the fourth taxable year following the year of its creation, whichever is later), distributes amounts, in cash or its equivalent, equal to not less than the distributable amount determined under subsection (d) (without regard to subsection (i)) for purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B) (including but not limited to payments with respect to set-asides which were treated as qualifying distributions in one or more prior years), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) the private foundation has distributed (including but not limited to payments with respect to set-asides which were treated as qualifying distributions in one or more prior years) during the four taxable years immediately preceding its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975, or the fifth taxable year following the year of its creation, whichever is later, an aggregate amount, in cash or its equivalent, of not less than the sum of the following: 80 percent of the first preceding taxable year's distributable amount; 60 percent of the second preceding taxable year's distributable amount; 40 percent of the third preceding taxable year's distributable amount; and 20 percent of the fourth preceding taxable year's distributable amount.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the foundation distributes an amount in cash or its equivalent which is not less than the difference between the amounts required to be distributed under clause (ii)(II) of subparagraph (B) and the amounts actually distributed in cash or its equivalent during that taxable year within the correction period (as defined in section 4963(e)),</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) not later than the close of the first taxable year after its taxable year in which such contribution is received, such organization makes a distribution equal to the amount of such contribution and such distribution is a qualifying distribution (within the meaning of paragraph (1) or (2), without regard to this paragraph) which is treated under subsection (h) as a distribution out of <!-- PDFPage:2102 -->corpus (or would be so treated if such section 501(c)(3) organization were a private foundation which is not an operating foundation), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the private foundation making the contribution obtains adequate records or other sufficient evidence from such organization showing that the qualifying distribution described in subparagraph (A) has been made by such organization.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Initial tax</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Imposition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There is hereby imposed on the excess business holdings of any private foundation in a business enterprise during any taxable year which ends during the taxable period a tax equal to 5 percent of the value of such holdings.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The tax imposed by paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall be imposed on the last day of the taxable year, but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with respect to the private foundation's holdings in any business enterprise, shall be determined as of that day during the taxable year when the foundation's excess holdings in such enterprise were the greatest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional tax</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which an initial tax is imposed under subsection (a) with respect to the holdings of a private foundation in any business enterprise, if, at the close of the taxable period with respect to such holdings, the foundation still has excess business holdings in such enterprise, there is hereby imposed a tax equal to 200 percent of such excess business holdings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Excess business holdings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;excess business holdings&rdquo; means, with respect to the holdings of any private <!-- PDFPage:2105 -->foundation in any business enterprise, the amount of stock or other interest in the enterprise which the foundation would have to dispose of to a person other than a disqualified person in order for the remaining holdings of the foundation in such enterprise to be permitted holdings.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Permitted holdings in a corporation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The permitted holdings of any private foundation in an incorporated business enterprise are&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A private foundation shall not be treated as having excess business holdings in any corporation in which it (together with all other private foundations which are described in section 4946(a)(1)(H)) owns not more than 2 percent of the voting stock and not more than 2 percent in value of all outstanding shares of all classes of stock.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Permitted holdings in partnerships, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The permitted holdings of a private foundation in any business enterprise which is not incorporated shall be determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Such regulations shall be consistent in principle with paragraphs (2) and (4), except that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in any other case, &ldquo;beneficial interest&rdquo; shall be substituted for &ldquo;voting stock&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Present holdings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) In applying this section with respect to the holdings of any private foundation in a business enterprise, if such foundation and all disqualified persons together have holdings in such enterprise in excess of 20 percent of the voting stock on May 26, 1969, the percentage of such holdings shall be substituted for &ldquo;20 percent,&rdquo; and for &ldquo;35 percent&rdquo; (if the percentage of such holdings is greater than 35 percent), wherever it appears in paragraph (2), but in no event shall the percentage so substituted be more than 50 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) If the percentage of the holdings of any private foundation and all disqualified persons together in a business enterprise (or if the percentage of the holdings of the private foundation in such enterprise) decreases for any reason, clause (i) and subparagraph (D) shall, except as provided in the next sentence, be applied for all periods after such decrease by substituting such decreased percentage for the percentage held on May 26, 1969, but in no event shall the percentage substituted be less than 20 percent. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any decrease in percentage holdings attributable to issuances of stock (or to issuances of stock coupled with redemptions of stock) shall be disregarded so long as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the net percentage decrease disregarded under this sentence does not exceed 2 percent, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the number of shares held by the foundation is not affected by any such issuance or redemption.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The percentage substituted under clause (i), and any percentage substituted under subparagraph (D), shall be applied both with respect to the voting stock and, separately, with respect to the value of all outstanding shares of all classes of stock.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) In the case of any merger, recapitalization, or other reorganization involving one or more business enterprises, the application of clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) shall be determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Tax on income of certain foreign organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In lieu of the tax imposed by section 4940, there is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the gross investment income (within the meaning of section 4940(c)(2)) derived from sources within the United States (within the meaning of section 861) by every foreign organization which is a private foundation for the taxable year a tax equal to 4 percent of such income.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certain sections inapplicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Section 507 (relating to termination of private foundation status), section 508 (relating to special rules with respect to section 501(c)(3) organizations), and this chapter (other than this section) shall not apply to any foreign organization which has received substantially all of its support (other than gross investment income) from sources outside the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Denial of exemption to foreign organizations engaged in prohibited transactions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A foreign organization described in subsection (b) shall not be exempt from taxation under section 501(a) if it has engaged in a prohibited transaction after December 31, 1969.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prohibited transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;prohibited transaction&rdquo; means any act or failure to act (other than with respect to section 4942(e)) which would subject a foreign organization described in subsection (b), or a disqualified person (as defined in section 4946) with respect thereto, to liability for a penalty under section 6684 or a tax under section 507 if such foreign organization were a domestic organization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Taxable years affected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a foreign organization described in subsection (b) shall be denied exemption from taxation under section 501(a) by reason of paragraph (1) for all taxable years beginning with the taxable year during which it is notified by the Secretary that it has engaged in a prohibited transaction. The Secretary shall publish such notice in the Federal Register on the day on which he so notifies such foreign organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary any foreign organization described in subsection (b) which is denied exemption from taxation under section 501(a) by reason of paragraph (1) may, with respect to the second taxable year following the taxable year in which notice is given under subparagraph (A) (or any taxable year thereafter), file claim for exemption from taxation under section 501(a). If the Secretary is satisfied that such organization will not knowingly again engage in a prohibited transaction, such organization shall not, with respect to taxable years beginning with the taxable year with respect to which such claim is filed, be denied exemption from taxation under section 501(a) by reason of any prohibited transaction which was engaged in before the date on which such notice was given under subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Disallowance of certain charitable deductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No gift or bequest shall be allowed as a deduction under section 170, 545(b)(2), 556(b)(2), 642(c), 2055, 2106(a)(2), or 2522, if made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to a foreign organization described in subsection (b) after the date on which the Secretary publishes notice under paragraph (3)(A) that he has notified such organization that it has engaged in a prohibited transaction, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in a taxable year of such organization for which it is not exempt from taxation under section 501(a) by reason of paragraph (1).</p>
