Such a deposit shall be made in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) No interest imposed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent that such deposit is used by the Secretary to pay tax, for purposes of section 6601 (relating to interest on underpayments), the tax shall be treated as paid when the deposit is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Return of deposit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except in a case where the Secretary determines that collection of tax is in jeopardy, the Secretary shall return to the taxpayer any amount of the deposit (to the extent not used for a payment of tax) which the taxpayer requests in writing.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of section 6611 (relating to interest on overpayments), except as provided in paragraph (4), a deposit which is returned to a taxpayer shall be treated as a payment of tax for any period to the extent (and only to the extent) attributable to a disputable tax for such period. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, rules similar to the rules of section 6611(b)(2) shall apply.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Disputable tax</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Safe harbor based on 30-day letter</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a taxpayer who has been issued a 30-day letter, the maximum amount of tax under subparagraph (A) shall not be less than the amount of the proposed deficiency specified in such letter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) has a reasonable basis for its treatment of such item, and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3334 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) reasonably believes that the Secretary also has a reasonable basis for disallowing the taxpayer's treatment of such item.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) 30-day letter</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;30-day letter&rdquo; means the first letter of proposed deficiency which allows the taxpayer an opportunity for administrative review in the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals.</p>
