<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Allowance of credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a taxpayer holds a qualified tax credit bond on one or more credit allowance dates of the bond during any taxable year, there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year an amount equal to the sum of the credits determined under subsection (b) with respect to such dates.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount of credit</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the credit determined under this subsection with respect to any credit allowance date for a qualified tax credit bond is 25 percent of the annual credit determined with respect to such bond.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The annual credit determined with respect to any qualified tax credit bond is the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the applicable credit rate, multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the outstanding face amount of the bond.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Applicable credit rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (2), the applicable credit rate is the rate which the Secretary estimates will permit the issuance of qualified tax credit bonds with a specified maturity or redemption date without discount and without interest cost to the qualified issuer. The applicable credit rate with respect to any qualified tax credit bond shall be determined as of the first day on which there is a binding, written contract for the sale or exchange of the bond.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule for issuance and redemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a bond which is issued during the 3-month period ending on a credit allowance date, the amount of the credit determined under this subsection with respect to such credit allowance date shall be a ratable portion of the credit otherwise determined based on the portion of the 3-month period during which the bond is outstanding. A similar rule shall apply when the bond is redeemed or matures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation based on amount of tax</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The credit allowed under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the sum of the regular tax liability (as defined in section 26(b)) plus the tax imposed by section 55, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the sum of the credits allowable under this part (other than subparts C and J and this subpart).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Carryover of unused credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the credit allowable under subsection (a) exceeds the limitation imposed by paragraph (1) for such taxable year, such excess shall be carried to the succeeding taxable year and added to the credit allowable under subsection (a) for such taxable year (determined before the application of paragraph (1) for such succeeding taxable year).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Qualified tax credit bond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Qualified tax credit bond</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An issue shall be treated as meeting the requirements of this paragraph if, as of the date of issuance, the issuer reasonably expects&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 100 percent or more of the available project proceeds to be spent for 1 or more qualified purposes within the 3-year period beginning on such date of issuance, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a binding commitment with a third party to spend at least 10 percent of such available project proceeds will be incurred within the 6-month period beginning on such date of issuance.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Failure to spend required amount of bond proceeds within 3 years</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">To the extent that less than 100 percent of the available project proceeds of the issue are expended by the close of the expenditure period for 1 or more qualified purposes, the issuer shall redeem all of the nonqualified bonds within 90 days after the end of such period. For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of the nonqualified bonds required to be redeemed shall be determined in the same manner as under section 142.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Extension of period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Upon submission of a request prior to the expiration of the expenditure period (determined without regard to any extension under this clause), the Secretary may extend such period if the issuer establishes that the failure to expend the proceeds within the original expenditure period is due to reasonable cause and the expenditures for qualified purposes will continue to proceed with due diligence.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Reimbursement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subtitle, available project proceeds of an issue shall be treated as spent for a qualified purpose if such proceeds are used to reimburse the issuer for amounts paid for a qualified purpose after the date that the Secretary makes an allocation of bond limitation with respect to such issue, but only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) prior to the payment of the original expenditure, the issuer declared its intent to reimburse such expenditure with the proceeds of a qualified tax credit bond,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) not later than 60 days after payment of the original expenditure, the issuer adopts an official intent to reimburse the original expenditure with such proceeds, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the reimbursement is made not later than 18 months after the date the original expenditure is paid.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule for investments during expenditure period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An issue shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) by reason of any investment of available project proceeds during the expenditure period.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Special rule for reserve funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An issue shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) by reason of any fund which is expected to be used to repay such issue if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such fund is funded at a rate not more rapid than equal annual installments,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such fund is funded in a manner reasonably expected to result in an amount not greater than an amount necessary to repay the issue, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the yield on such fund is not greater than the discount rate determined under paragraph (5)(B) with respect to the issue.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Maturity limitation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Maximum term</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">During each calendar month, the Secretary shall determine the maximum term <!-- PDFPage:326 -->permitted under this paragraph for bonds issued during the following calendar month. Such maximum term shall be the term which the Secretary estimates will result in the present value of the obligation to repay the principal on the bond being equal to 50 percent of the face amount of such bond. Such present value shall be determined using as a discount rate the average annual interest rate of tax-exempt obligations having a term of 10 years or more which are issued during the month. If the term as so determined is not a multiple of a whole year, such term shall be rounded to the next highest whole year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Prohibition on financial conflicts of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An issue shall be treated as meeting the requirements of this paragraph if the issuer certifies that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the Secretary prescribes additional conflicts of interest rules governing the appropriate Members of Congress, Federal, State, and local officials, and their spouses, such additional rules are satisfied with respect to such issue.</p>
