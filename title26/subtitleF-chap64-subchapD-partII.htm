<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the same within 10 days after notice and demand, it shall be lawful for the Secretary to collect such tax (and such further sum as shall be sufficient to cover the expenses of the levy) by levy upon all property and rights to property (except such property as is exempt under section 6334) belonging to such person or on which there is a lien provided in this chapter for the payment of such tax. Levy may be made upon the accrued salary or wages of any officer, employee, or elected official, of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States or the District of Columbia, by serving a notice of levy on the employer (as defined in section 3401(d)) of such officer, employee, or elected official. If the Secretary makes a finding that the collection of such tax is in jeopardy, notice and demand for immediate payment of such tax may be made by the Secretary and, upon failure or refusal to pay such tax, collection thereof by levy shall be lawful without regard to the 10-day period provided in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Seizure and sale of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;levy&rdquo; as used in this title includes the power of distraint and seizure by any means. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a levy shall extend only to property possessed and obligations existing at the time thereof. In any case in which the Secretary may levy upon property or rights to property, he may seize and sell such property or rights to property (whether real or personal, tangible or intangible).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3103 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Successive seizures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any property or right to property upon which levy has been made by virtue of subsection (a) is not sufficient to satisfy the claim of the United States for which levy is made, the Secretary may, thereafter, and as often as may be necessary, proceed to levy in like manner upon any other property liable to levy of the person against whom such claim exists, until the amount due from him, together with all expenses, is fully paid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Requirement of notice before levy</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Levy on appearance date of summons</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6332. Surrender of property subject to levy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, any person in possession of (or obligated with respect to) property or rights to property subject to levy upon which a levy has been made shall, upon demand of the Secretary, surrender such property or rights (or discharge such obligation) to the Secretary, except such part of the property or rights as is, at the time of such demand, subject to an attachment or execution under any judicial process.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rule for life insurance and endowment contracts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A levy on an organization with respect to a life insurance or endowment contract issued by such organization shall, without necessity for the surrender of the contract document, constitute a demand by the Secretary for payment of the amount described in paragraph (2) and the exercise of the right of the person against whom the tax is assessed to the advance of such amount. Such organization shall pay over such amount 90 days after service of notice of levy. Such notice shall include a certification by the Secretary that a copy of such notice has been mailed to the person against whom the tax is assessed at his last known address.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Satisfaction of levy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such levy shall be deemed to be satisfied if such organization pays over to the Secretary the amount which the person against whom the tax is assessed could have had advanced to him by such organization on the date prescribed in paragraph (1) for the satisfaction of such levy, increased by the amount of any advance (including contractual interest thereon) made to such person on or after the date such organization had actual notice or knowledge (within the meaning of section 6323(i)(1)) of the existence of the lien with respect to which such levy is made, other than an advance (including contractual interest thereon) made automatically to maintain such contract in force under an agreement entered into before such organization had such notice or knowledge.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Enforcement proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The satisfaction of a levy under paragraph (2) shall be without prejudice to any civil action for the enforcement of any lien imposed by this title with respect to such contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rule for banks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any bank (as defined in section 408(n)) shall surrender (subject to an attachment or execution under judicial process) any deposits (including interest thereon) in such bank only after 21 days after service of levy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Enforcement of levy</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Extent of personal liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any person who fails or refuses to surrender any property or rights to property, subject to levy, upon demand by the Secretary, shall be liable in his own person and estate to the United States in a sum equal to the value of the property or rights not so surrendered, but not exceeding the amount of taxes for the collection of which such levy has been made, together with costs and interest on such sum at the underpayment rate established under section 6621 from the date of such levy (or, in the case of a levy described in section 6331(d)(3), from the date such person would otherwise have been obligated to pay over such amounts to the taxpayer). Any amount (other than costs) recovered under this paragraph shall be credited against the tax liability for the collection of which such levy was made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Penalty for violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to the personal liability imposed by paragraph (1), if any person required to surrender property or rights to property fails or refuses to surrender such property or rights to property without reasonable cause, such person shall be liable for a penalty equal to 50 percent of the amount recoverable under paragraph (1). No part of such penalty shall be credited against the tax liability for the collection of which such levy was made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect of honoring levy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person in possession of (or obligated with respect to) property or rights to property subject to levy upon which a levy has been made who, upon demand by the Secretary, surrenders such property or rights to property (or discharges such obligation) to the Secretary (or who pays a liability under subsection (d)(1)) shall be discharged from any obligation or liability to the delinquent taxpayer and any other person with respect to such property or rights to property arising from such surrender or payment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Person defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;person,&rdquo; as used in subsection (a), includes an officer or employee of a corporation <!-- PDFPage:3107 -->or a member or employee of a partnership, who as such officer, employee, or member is under a duty to surrender the property or rights to property, or to discharge the obligation.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6335. Sale of seized property</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Notice of seizure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As soon as practicable after seizure of property, notice in writing shall be given by the Secretary to the owner of the property (or, in the case of personal property, the possessor thereof), or shall be left at his usual place of abode or business if he has such within the internal revenue district where the seizure is made. If the owner cannot be readily located, or has no dwelling or place of business within such district, the notice may be mailed to his last known address. Such notice shall specify the sum demanded and shall contain, in the case of personal property, an account of the property seized and, in the case of real property, a description with reasonable certainty of the property seized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notice of sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall as soon as practicable after the seizure of the property give notice to the owner, in the manner prescribed in subsection (a), and shall cause a notification to be published in some newspaper published or generally circulated within the county wherein such seizure is made, or if there be no newspaper published or generally circulated in such county, shall post such notice at the post office nearest the place where the seizure is made, and in not less than two other public places. Such notice shall specify the property to be sold, and the time, place, manner, and conditions of the sale thereof. Whenever levy is made without regard to the 10-day period provided in section 6331(a), public notice of sale of the property seized shall not be made within such 10-day period unless section 6336 (relating to sale of perishable goods) is applicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Sale of indivisible property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any property liable to levy is not divisible, so as to enable the Secretary by sale of a part thereof to raise the whole amount of the tax and expenses, the whole of such property shall be sold.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Time and place of sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The time of sale shall not be less than 10 days nor more than 40 days from the time of giving public notice under subsection (b). The place of sale shall be within the county in which the property is seized, except by special order of the Secretary.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3112 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Manner and conditions of sale</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Determinations relating to minimum price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before the sale of property seized by levy, the Secretary shall determine&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a minimum price below which such property shall not be sold (taking into account the expense of making the levy and conducting the sale), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) whether, on the basis of criteria prescribed by the Secretary, the purchase of such property by the United States at such minimum price would be in the best interest of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Sale to highest bidder at or above minimum price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, at the sale, one or more persons offer to purchase such property for not less than the amount of the minimum price, the property shall be declared sold to the highest bidder.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Property deemed sold to United States at minimum price in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If no person offers the amount of the minimum price for such property at the sale and the Secretary has determined that the purchase of such property by the United States would be in the best interest of the United States, the property shall be declared to be sold to the United States at such minimum price.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Release to owner in other cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, at the sale, the property is not declared sold under subparagraph (B) or (C), the property shall be released to the owner thereof and the expense of the levy and sale shall be added to the amount of tax for the collection of which the levy was made. Any property released under this subparagraph shall remain subject to any lien imposed by subchapter C.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional rules applicable to sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall by regulations prescribe the manner and other conditions of the sale of property seized by levy. If one or more alternative methods or conditions are permitted by regulations, the Secretary shall select the alternatives applicable to the sale. Such regulations shall provide:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) That the sale shall not be conducted in any manner other than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) by public auction, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by public sale under sealed bids.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) In the case of the seizure of several items of property, whether such items shall be offered separately, in groups, or in the aggregate; and whether such property shall be offered both separately (or in groups) and in the aggregate, and sold under whichever method produces the highest aggregate amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Whether the announcement of the minimum price determined by the Secretary may be delayed until the receipt of the highest bid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Whether payment in full shall be required at the time of acceptance of a bid, or whether a part of such payment may be deferred for such period (not to exceed 1 month) as may be determined by the Secretary to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The extent to which methods (including advertising) in addition to those prescribed in subsection (b) may be used in giving notice of the sale.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Under what circumstances the Secretary may adjourn the sale from time to time (but such adjournments shall not be for a period to exceed in all 1 month).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Payment of amount bid</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If payment in full is required at the time of acceptance of a bid and is not then and there paid, the Secretary shall forthwith proceed to again sell the property in the manner provided in this subsection. If the conditions of the sale permit part of the payment to be deferred, and if such part is not paid within the prescribed period, suit may be instituted against the purchaser for the purchase price or such part thereof as has not been paid, together with interest at the rate of 6 percent per annum from the date of the sale; or, in the discretion of the Secretary, the sale may be declared by the Secretary to be null and void for failure to make full payment of the purchase price and the property may again be advertised and sold as provided in subsections (b) and (c) and this subsection. In the event of such readvertisement and sale any new purchaser shall receive such property or rights to property, free and clear of any claim or right of the former defaulting purchaser, of any nature whatsoever, and the amount paid upon the bid price by such defaulting purchaser shall be forfeited.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Cross reference</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>For provision providing for civil damages for violation of paragraph (1)(A)(i), see section 7433.</strong></p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Right to request sale of seized property within 60 days</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The owner of any property seized by levy may request that the Secretary sell such property within 60 days after such request (or within such longer period as may be specified by the owner). The Secretary shall comply with such request unless the Secretary determines (and notifies the owner within such period) that such compliance would not be in the best interests of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Stay of sale of seized property pending Tax Court decision</h4>
<p class="note-body-2em"><strong>For restrictions on sale of seized property pending Tax Court decision, see section 6863(b)(3).</strong></p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Release of levy and notice of release</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the Secretary shall release the levy upon all, or part of, the property or rights to property levied upon and shall promptly notify the person upon whom such levy was made (if any) that such levy has been released if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the liability for which such levy was made is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) release of such levy will facilitate the collection of such liability,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the taxpayer has entered into an agreement under section 6159 to satisfy such liability by means of installment payments, unless such agreement provides otherwise,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the Secretary has determined that such levy is creating an economic hardship due to the financial condition of the taxpayer, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the fair market value of the property exceeds such liability and release of the levy on a part of such property could be made without hindering the collection of such liability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (C), the Secretary is not required to release such levy if such release would jeopardize the secured creditor status of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Expedited determination on certain business property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any tangible personal property essential in carrying on the trade or business of the taxpayer, the Secretary shall provide for an expedited determination under paragraph (1) if levy on such tangible personal property would prevent the taxpayer from carrying on such trade or business.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Subsequent levy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The release of levy on any property under paragraph (1) shall not prevent any subsequent levy on such property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Return of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary determines that property has been wrongfully levied upon, it shall be lawful for the Secretary to return&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the specific property levied upon,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an amount of money equal to the amount of money levied upon, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an amount of money equal to the amount of money received by the United States from a sale of such property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Property may be returned at any time. An amount equal to the amount of money levied upon or received from such sale may be returned at any time before the expiration of 9 months from the date of such levy. For purposes of paragraph (3), if property is declared purchased by the United States at a sale pursuant to section 6335(e) (relating to manner and conditions of sale), the United States shall be treated as having received an amount of money equal to the minimum price determined pursuant to such section or (if larger) the amount received by the United States from the resale of such property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Interest shall be allowed and paid at the overpayment rate established under section 6621&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in a case described in subsection (b)(2), from the date the Secretary receives the money to a date (to be determined by the Secretary) preceding the date of return by not more than 30 days, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in a case described in subsection (b)(3), from the date of the sale of the property to a date (to be determined by the Secretary) preceding the date of return by not more than 30 days.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Return of property in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any property has been levied upon, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the return of such property will facilitate the collection of the tax liability, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) with the consent of the taxpayer or the National Taxpayer Advocate, the return of such property would be in the best interests of the taxpayer (as determined by the National Taxpayer Advocate) and the United States,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the provisions of subsection (b) shall apply in the same manner as if such property had been wrongly levied upon, except that no interest shall be allowed under subsection (c).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3117 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Release of levy upon agreement that amount is not collectible</h4>
