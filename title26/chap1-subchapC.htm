<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a corporation redeems its stock (within the meaning of section 317(b)), and if paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) of subsection (b) applies, such redemption shall be treated as a distribution in part or full payment in exchange for the stock.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Redemptions treated as exchanges</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Redemptions not equivalent to dividends</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (a) shall apply if the redemption is not essentially equivalent to a dividend.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Substantially disproportionate redemption of stock</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subsection (a) shall apply if the distribution is substantially disproportionate with respect to the shareholder.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This paragraph shall not apply unless immediately after the redemption the shareholder owns less than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the distribution is substantially disproportionate if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the ratio which the voting stock of the corporation owned by the shareholder immediately after the redemption bears to all of the voting stock of the corporation at such time,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">is less than 80 percent of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the ratio which the voting stock of the corporation owned by the shareholder immediately before the redemption bears to all of the voting stock of the corporation at such time.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, no distribution shall be treated as substantially disproportionate unless the shareholder's ownership of the common stock of the corporation (whether voting or nonvoting) after and before redemption also meets the 80 percent requirement of the preceding sentence. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if there is more than one class of common stock, the determinations shall be made by reference to fair market value.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Series of redemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This paragraph shall not apply to any redemption made pursuant to a plan the pur<!-- PDFPage:625 -->pose or effect of which is a series of redemptions resulting in a distribution which (in the aggregate) is not substantially disproportionate with respect to the shareholder.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Termination of shareholder's interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (a) shall apply if the redemption is in complete redemption of all of the stock of the corporation owned by the shareholder.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Redemption from noncorporate shareholder in partial liquidation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsection (a) shall apply to a distribution if such distribution is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in redemption of stock held by a shareholder who is not a corporation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in partial liquidation of the distributing corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Application of paragraphs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining whether a redemption meets the requirements of paragraph (1), the fact that such redemption fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (2), (3), or (4) shall not be taken into account. If a redemption meets the requirements of paragraph (3) and also the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), or (4), then so much of subsection (c)(2) as would (but for this sentence) apply in respect of the acquisition of an interest in the corporation within the 10-year period beginning on the date of the distribution shall not apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Constructive ownership of stock</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, section 318(a) shall apply in determining the ownership of stock for purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) For determining termination of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) In the case of a distribution described in subsection (b)(3), section 318(a)(1) shall not apply if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) immediately after the distribution the distributee has no interest in the corporation (including an interest as officer, director, or employee), other than an interest as a creditor,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the distributee does not acquire any such interest (other than stock acquired by bequest or inheritance) within 10 years from the date of such distribution, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the distributee, at such time and in such manner as the Secretary by regulations prescribes, files an agreement to notify the Secretary of any acquisition described in clause (ii) and to retain such records as may be necessary for the application of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">If the distributee acquires such an interest in the corporation (other than by bequest or inheritance) within 10 years from the date of the distribution, then the periods of limitation provided in sections 6501 and 6502 on the making of an assessment and the collection by levy or a proceeding in court shall, with respect to any deficiency (including interest and additions to the tax) resulting from such acquisition, include one year immediately following the date on which the distributee (in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary) notifies the Secretary of such acquisition; and such assessment and collection may be made notwithstanding any provision of law or rule of law which otherwise would prevent such assessment and collection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not apply if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any portion of the stock redeemed was acquired, directly or indirectly, within the 10-year period ending on the date of the distribution by the distributee from a person the ownership of whose stock would (at the time of distribution) be attributable to the distributee under section 318(a), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any person owns (at the time of the distribution) stock the ownership of which is attributable to the distributee under section 318(a) and such person acquired any stock in the corporation, directly or indirectly, from the distributee within the 10-year period ending on the date of the distribution, unless such stock so acquired from the distributee is redeemed in the same transaction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The preceding sentence shall not apply if the acquisition (or, in the case of clause (ii), the disposition) by the distributee did not have as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of Federal income tax.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Special rule for waivers by entities</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to a distribution to any entity unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) such entity and each related person meet the requirements of clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph (A), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) each related person agrees to be jointly and severally liable for any deficiency (including interest and additions to tax) resulting from an acquisition described in clause (ii) of subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;In any case to which the preceding sentence applies, the second sentence of subparagraph (A) and subparagraph (B)(ii) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;distributee or any related person&rdquo; for &ldquo;distributee&rdquo; each place it appears.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the term &ldquo;entity&rdquo; means a partnership, estate, trust, or corporation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the term &ldquo;related person&rdquo; means any person to whom ownership of stock in the corporation is (at the time of the distribution) attributable under section 318(a)(1) if such stock is further attributable to the entity under section 318(a)(3).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Redemptions treated as distributions of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, if a corporation redeems its stock (within the meaning of section 317(b)), and if subsection (a) of this section does not apply, such redemption shall be treated as a distribution of property to which section 301 applies.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:626 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Partial liquidation defined</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (b)(4), a distribution shall be treated as in partial liquidation of a corporation if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the distribution is not essentially equivalent to a dividend (determined at the corporate level rather than at the shareholder level), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the distribution is pursuant to a plan and occurs within the taxable year in which the plan is adopted or within the succeeding taxable year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Termination of business</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The distributions which meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(A) shall include (but shall not be limited to) a distribution which meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The distribution is attributable to the distributing corporation's ceasing to conduct, or consists of the assets of, a qualified trade or business.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Immediately after the distribution, the distributing corporation is actively engaged in the conduct of a qualified trade or business.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Qualified trade or business</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (2), the term &ldquo;qualified trade or business&rdquo; means any trade or business which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) was actively conducted throughout the 5-year period ending on the date of the redemption, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) was not acquired by the corporation within such period in a transaction in which gain or loss was recognized in whole or in part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Redemption may be pro rata</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whether or not a redemption meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2) shall be determined without regard to whether or not the redemption is pro rata with respect to all of the shareholders of the corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Treatment of certain pass-thru entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of determining under subsection (b)(4) whether any stock is held by a shareholder who is not a corporation, any stock held by a partnership, estate, or trust shall be treated as if it were actually held proportionately by its partners or beneficiaries.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the adjusted basis of the other property, so distributed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Distributions of appreciated property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On the distribution by a corporation, with respect to its stock, of any property (other than an obligation of such corporation) the fair market value of which exceeds the adjusted basis thereof&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the earnings and profits of the corporation shall be increased by the amount of such excess, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) subsection (a)(3) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;fair market value&rdquo; for &ldquo;adjusted basis&rdquo;.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this subsection and subsection (a), the adjusted basis of any property is its adjusted basis as determined for purposes of computing earnings and profits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjustments for liabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In making the adjustments to the earnings and profits of a corporation under subsection (a) or (b), proper adjustment shall be made for&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of any liability of the corporation assumed by a shareholder in connection with the distribution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Certain distributions of stock and securities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The distribution to a distributee by or on behalf of a corporation of its stock or securities, of stock or securities in another corporation, or of property, in a distribution to which this title applies, shall not be considered a distribution of the earnings and profits of any corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if no gain to such distributee from the receipt of such stock or securities, or property, was recognized under this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the distribution was not subject to tax in the hands of such distributee by reason of section 305(a).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prior distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a distribution of stock or securities, or property, to which section 115(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 (or the corresponding provision of prior law) applied, the effect on earnings and profits of such distribution shall be determined under such section 115(h), or the corresponding provision of prior law, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Stock or securities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;stock or securities&rdquo; includes rights to acquire stock or securities.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Effect on earnings and profits of gain or loss and of receipt of tax-free distributions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Effect on earnings and profits of gain or loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The gain or loss realized from the sale or other disposition (after February 28, 1913) of property by a corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for the purpose of the computation of the earnings and profits of the corporation, shall (except as provided in subparagraph (B)) be determined by using as the adjusted basis the adjusted basis (under the law applicable to the year in which the sale or other disposition was made) for determining gain, except that no regard shall be had to the value of the property as of March 1, 1913; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for purposes of the computation of the earnings and profits of the corporation for any period beginning after February 28, 1913, shall be determined by using as the adjusted basis the adjusted basis (under the law applicable to the year in which the sale or other disposition was made) for determining gain.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:642 --><p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Gain or loss so realized shall increase or decrease the earnings and profits to, but not beyond, the extent to which such a realized gain or loss was recognized in computing taxable income under the law applicable to the year in which such sale or disposition was made. Where, in determining the adjusted basis used in computing such realized gain or loss, the adjustment to the basis differs from the adjustment proper for the purpose of determining earnings and profits, then the latter adjustment shall be used in determining the increase or decrease above provided. For purposes of this subsection, a loss with respect to which a deduction is disallowed under section 1091 (relating to wash sales of stock or securities), or the corresponding provision of prior law, shall not be deemed to be recognized.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effect on earnings and profits of receipt of tax-free distributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Where a corporation receives (after February 28, 1913) a distribution from a second corporation which (under the law applicable to the year in which the distribution was made) was not a taxable dividend to the shareholders of the second corporation, the amount of such distribution shall not increase the earnings and profits of the first corporation in the following cases:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) no such increase shall be made in respect of the part of such distribution which (under such law) is directly applied in reduction of the basis of the stock in respect of which the distribution was made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) no such increase shall be made if (under such law) the distribution causes the basis of the stock in respect of which the distribution was made to be allocated between such stock and the property received (or such basis would, but for section 307(b), be so allocated).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Earnings and profits&mdash;increase in value accrued before March 1, 1913</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If any increase or decrease in the earnings and profits for any period beginning after February 28, 1913, with respect to any matter would be different had the adjusted basis of the property involved been determined without regard to its March 1, 1913, value, then, except as provided in paragraph (2), an increase (properly reflecting such difference) shall be made in that part of the earnings and profits consisting of increase in value of property accrued before March 1, 1913.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If the application of subsection (f) to a sale or other disposition after February 28, 1913, results in a loss which is to be applied in decrease of earnings and profits for any period beginning after February 28, 1913, then, notwithstanding subsection (f) and in lieu of the rule provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the amount of such loss so to be applied shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which the adjusted basis of the property used in determining the loss exceeds the adjusted basis computed without regard to the value of the property on March 1, 1913, and if such amount so applied in reduction of the decrease exceeds such loss, the excess over such loss shall increase that part of the earnings and profits consisting of increase in value of property accrued before March 1, 1913.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Allocation in certain corporate separations and reorganizations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Section 355</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a distribution or exchange to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies, proper allocation with respect to the earnings and profits of the distributing corporation and the controlled corporation (or corporations) shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Section 368(a)(1)(C) or (D)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a reorganization described in subparagraph (C) or (D) of section 368(a)(1), proper allocation with respect to the earnings and profits of the acquired corporation shall, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, be made between the acquiring corporation and the acquired corporation (or any corporation which had control of the acquired corporation before the reorganization).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Distribution of proceeds of loan insured by the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a corporation distributes property with respect to its stock and if, at the time of distribution&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is outstanding a loan to such corporation which was made, guaranteed, or insured by the United States (or by any agency or instrumentality thereof), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of such loan so outstanding exceeds the adjusted basis of the property constituting security for such loan,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the earnings and profits of the corporation shall be increased by the amount of such excess, and (immediately after the distribution) shall be decreased by the amount of such excess. For purposes of paragraph (2), the adjusted basis of the property at the time of distribution shall be determined without regard to any adjustment under section 1016(a)(2) (relating to adjustment for depreciation, etc.). For purposes of this subsection, a commitment to make, guarantee, or insure a loan shall be treated as the making, guaranteeing, or insuring of a loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Earnings and profits of foreign investment companies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Allocation within affiliated group</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a sale or exchange of stock in a foreign investment company (as defined in section 1246(b)) by a United States person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)), if such company is a member of an affiliated group, then the accumulated earnings and profits of all members of such affiliated group shall be allocated, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, in such manner as is proper to carry out the purposes of section 1246.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Affiliated group defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the term &ldquo;affiliated group&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to such term by section 1504(a); except that (A) &ldquo;more than 50 percent&rdquo; shall be substituted for &ldquo;80 percent or more&rdquo;, and (B) all corporations shall be treated as in<!-- PDFPage:643 -->cludible corporations (without regard to the provisions of section 1504(b)).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of computing the earnings and profits of a corporation for any taxable year beginning after June 30, 1972, the allowance for depreciation (and amortization, if any) shall be deemed to be the amount which would be allowable for such year if the straight line method of depreciation had been used for each taxable year beginning after June 30, 1972.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If for any taxable year a method of depreciation was used by the taxpayer which the Secretary has determined results in a reasonable allowance under section 167(a) and which is the unit-of-production method or other method not expressed in a term of years, then the adjustment to earnings and profits for depreciation for such year shall be determined under the method so used (in lieu of the straight line method).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), in the case of tangible property to which section 168 applies, the adjustment to earnings and profits for depreciation for any taxable year shall be determined under the alternative depreciation system (within the meaning of section 168(g)(2)).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of computing the earnings and profits of a corporation, any amount deductible under section 179 shall be allowed as a deduction ratably over the period of 5 taxable years (beginning with the taxable year for which such amount is deductible under section 179).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Certain foreign corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not apply in computing the earnings and profits of a foreign corporation for any taxable year for which less than 20 percent of the gross income from all sources of such corporation is derived from sources within the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Basis adjustment not taken into account</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the taxpayer receives property which would be permitted to be received under section 351 or 361 without the recognition of gain if it were the sole consideration, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as part of the consideration, another party to the exchange assumes a liability of the taxpayer, or acquires from the taxpayer property subject to a liability,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then such assumption or acquisition shall not be treated as money or other property, and shall not prevent the exchange from being within the provisions of section 351 or 361, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Tax avoidance purpose</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, taking into consideration the nature of the liability and the circumstances in the light of which the arrangement for the assumption or acquisition was made, it appears that the principal purpose of the taxpayer with respect to the assumption or acquisition described in subsection (a)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) was a purpose to avoid Federal income tax on the exchange, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if not such purpose, was not a bona fide business purpose,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:681 --><p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then such assumption or acquisition (in the total amount of the liability assumed or acquired pursuant to such exchange) shall, for purposes of section 351 or 361 (as the case may be), be considered as money received by the taxpayer on the exchange.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any suit or proceeding where the burden is on the taxpayer to prove such assumption or acquisition is not to be treated as money received by the taxpayer, such burden shall not be considered as sustained unless the taxpayer sustains such burden by the clear preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Liabilities in excess of basis</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an exchange&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to which section 351 applies, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to which section 361 applies by reason of a plan of reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(D),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">if the sum of the amount of the liabilities assumed, plus the amount of the liabilities to which the property is subject, exceeds the total of the adjusted basis of the property transferred pursuant to such exchange, then such excess shall be considered as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or of property which is not a capital asset, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any exchange&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to which subsection (b)(1) of this section applies, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which is pursuant to a plan of reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(G) where no former shareholder of the transferor corporation receives any consideration for his stock.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certain liabilities excluded</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a taxpayer transfers, in an exchange to which section 351 applies, a liability the payment of which either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) would give rise to a deduction, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) would be described in section 736(a),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then, for purposes of paragraph (1), the amount of such liability shall be excluded in determining the amount of liabilities assumed or to which the property transferred is subject.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any liability to the extent that the incurrence of the liability resulted in the creation of, or an increase in, the basis of any property.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No gain or loss shall be recognized to a corporation if such corporation is a party to a reorganization and exchanges property, in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, solely for stock or securities in another corporation a party to the reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exchanges not solely in kind</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Gain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If subsection (a) would apply to an exchange but for the fact that the property received in exchange consists not only of stock or securities permitted by subsection (a) to be received without the recognition of gain, but also of other property or money, then&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Property distributed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the corporation receiving such other property or money distributes it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, no gain to the corporation shall be recognized from the exchange, but</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Property not distributed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the corporation receiving such other property or money does not distribute it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, the gain, if any, to the corporation shall be recognized.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The amount of gain recognized under subparagraph (B) shall not exceed the sum of the money and the fair market value of the other property so received which is not so distributed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If subsection (a) would apply to an exchange but for the fact that the property received in exchange consists not only of property permitted by subsection (a) to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, but also of other property or money, then no loss from the exchange shall be recognized.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of transfers to creditors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), any transfer of the other property or money received in the exchange by the corporation to its creditors in connection with the reorganization shall be treated as a distribution in pursuance of the plan of reorganization. The Secretary may prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to prevent avoidance of tax through abuse of the preceding sentence or subsection (c)(3).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Treatment of distributions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), no gain or loss shall be recognized to a corporation a party to a reorganization on the distribution to its shareholders of property in pursuance of the plan of reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Distributions of appreciated property</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in a distribution referred to in paragraph (1), the corporation distributes property other than qualified property, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the fair market value of such property exceeds its adjusted basis (in the hands of the distributing corporation),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then gain shall be recognized to the distributing corporation as if such property were sold to the distributee at its fair market value.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Qualified property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;qualified property&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any stock in (or right to acquire stock in) the distributing corporation or obligation of the distributing corporation, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any stock in (or right to acquire stock in) another corporation which is a party to the reorganization or obligation of another corporation which is such a party if such stock (or right) or obligation is received by the distributing corporation in the exchange.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Treatment of liabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If any property distributed in the distribution referred to in paragraph (1) is subject to a liability or the shareholder assumes a liability of the distributing corporation in <!-- PDFPage:684 -->connection with the distribution, then, for purposes of subparagraph (A), the fair market value of such property shall be treated as not less than the amount of such liability.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of certain transfers to creditors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, any transfer of qualified property by the corporation to its creditors in connection with the reorganization shall be treated as a distribution to its shareholders pursuant to the plan of reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Coordination with other provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Section 311 and subpart B of part II of this subchapter shall not apply to any distribution referred to in paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the acquiring corporation acquires, solely for voting stock described in paragraph (1)(C), property of the other corporation having a fair market value which is at least 80 percent of the fair market value of all of the property of the other corporation,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then such acquisition shall (subject to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph) be treated as qualifying under paragraph (1)(C).

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Statutory merger using voting stock of corporation controlling merged corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A transaction otherwise qualifying under paragraph (1)(A) shall not be disqualified by reason of the fact that stock of a corporation (referred to in this subparagraph as the &ldquo;controlling corporation&rdquo;) which before the merger was in control of the merged corporation is used in the transaction, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) after the transaction, the corporation surviving the merger holds substantially all of its properties and of the properties of the merged corporation (other than stock of the controlling corporation distributed in the transaction); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the transaction, former shareholders of the surviving corporation exchanged, for an amount of voting stock of the controlling corporation, an amount of stock in the surviving corporation which constitutes control of such corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Certain transactions involving 2 or more investment companies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) If immediately before a transaction described in paragraph (1) (other than subparagraph (E) thereof), 2 or more parties to the transaction were investment companies, then the transaction shall not be considered to be a reorganization with respect to any such investment company (and its shareholders and security holders) unless it was a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, or a corporation which meets the requirements of clause (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) A corporation meets the requirements of this clause if not more than 25 percent of the value of its total assets is invested in the stock and securities of any one issuer, and not more than 50 percent of the value of its total assets is invested in the stock and securities of 5 or fewer issuers. For purposes of this clause, all members of a controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1563(a)) shall be treated as one issuer. For purposes of this clause, a person holding stock in a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, or an investment company which meets the requirements of this clause shall, except as provided in regulations, be treated as holding its proportionate share of the assets held by such company or trust.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) For purposes of this subparagraph the term &ldquo;investment company&rdquo; means a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, or a corporation 50 percent or more of the value of whose total assets are stock and securities and 80 percent or more of the value of whose total assets are assets held for investment. In making the 50-percent and 80-percent determinations under the preceding sentence, stock and securities in any subsidiary corporation shall be disregarded and the parent corporation shall be deemed to own its ratable share of the subsidiary's assets, and a corporation shall be considered a subsidiary if the parent owns 50 percent or more of the combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or 50 percent or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock outstanding.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:690 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) For purposes of this subparagraph, in determining total assets there shall be excluded cash and cash items (including receivables). Government securities, and, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, assets acquired (through incurring indebtedness or otherwise) for purposes of meeting the requirements of clause (ii) or ceasing to be an investment company.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) This subparagraph shall not apply if the stock of each investment company is owned substantially by the same persons in the same proportions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) If an investment company which does not meet the requirements of clause (ii) acquires assets of another corporation, clause (i) shall be applied to such investment company and its shareholders and security holders as though its assets had been acquired by such other corporation. If such investment company acquires stock of another corporation in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B), clause (i) shall be applied to the shareholders of such investment company as though they had exchanged with such other corporation all of their stock in such company for stock having a fair market value equal to the fair market value of their stock of such investment company immediately after the exchange. For purposes of section 1001, the deemed acquisition or exchange referred to in the two preceding sentences shall be treated as a sale or exchange of property by the corporation and by the shareholders and security holders to which clause (i) is applied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) For purposes of clauses (ii) and (iii), the term &ldquo;securities&rdquo; includes obligations of State and local governments, commodity futures contracts, shares of regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts, and other investments constituting a security within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;2(36)).<sup><a href="#368_1_target" name="368_1">1</a></sup></p>
