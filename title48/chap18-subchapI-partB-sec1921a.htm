Funds appropriated pursuant to section 1921d(j) of this title may be used to reimburse State or local agencies providing such assistance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Agreement on audits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Comptroller General (and his duly authorized representatives) shall have the authorities necessary to carry out his responsibilities under section 232 of the U.S.-FSM Compact and the agreement referred to in section 462(b)(4) of the U.S.-FSM Compact, including the following authorities:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General authority of the Comptroller General to audit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Comptroller General of the United States (and his duly authorized representatives) shall have the authority to audit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) all grants, program assistance, and other assistance provided to the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia under Articles I and II of Title Two of the U.S.-FSM Compact; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) any other assistance provided by the Government of the United States to the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Such authority shall include authority for the Comptroller General to conduct or cause to be conducted any of the audits provided for in section 232 of the U.S.-FSM Compact. The authority provided in this paragraph shall continue for at least three years after the last such grant has been made or assistance has been provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Comptroller General (and his duly authorized representatives) shall also have authority to review any audit conducted by or on behalf of the Government of the United States. In this connection, the Comptroller General shall have access to such personnel and to such records, documents, working papers, automated data and files, and other information relevant to such review.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Comptroller General access to records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In carrying out paragraph (1), the Comptroller General (and his duly authorized representatives) shall have such access to the personnel and (without cost) to records, documents, working papers, automated data and files, and other information relevant to such audits. The Comptroller General may duplicate any such records, documents, working papers, automated data and files, or other information relevant to such audits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Such records, documents, working papers, automated data and files, and other information regarding each such grant or other assistance shall be maintained for at least five years after the date such grant or assistance was provided and in a manner that permits such grants, assistance, and payments to be accounted for distinct from any other funds of the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Status of Comptroller General representatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Comptroller General and his duly authorized representatives shall be immune from civil and criminal process relating to words spoken or written and all acts performed by them in their official capacity and falling within their functions, except insofar as such immunity may be expressly waived by the Government of the United States. The Comptroller General and his duly authorized representatives shall not be liable to arrest or detention pending trial, except in the case of a grave crime and pursuant to a decision by a competent judicial authority, and such persons shall enjoy immunity from seizure of personal property, immigration restrictions, and laws relating to alien registration, fingerprinting, and the registration of foreign agents. Such persons shall enjoy the same taxation exemptions as are set forth in Article 34 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The privileges, exemptions and immunities accorded under this paragraph are not for <!-- PDFPage:264 -->the personal benefit of the individuals concerned but are to safeguard the independent exercise of their official functions. Without prejudice to those privileges, exemptions and immunities, it is the duty of all such persons to respect the laws and regulations of the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Audits defined</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the propriety of the financial transactions of the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia pursuant to such grants or assistance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Cooperation by Federated States of Micronesia</h4>
