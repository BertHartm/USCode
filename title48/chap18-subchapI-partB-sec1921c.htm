<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Human rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In approving the U.S.-FSM Compact and the U.S.-RMI Compact, Congress notes the conclusion in the Statement of Intent of the Report of The Future Political Status Commission of the Congress of Micronesia in July, 1969, that &ldquo;our recommendation of a free associated state is indissolubly linked to our desire for such a democratic, representative, constitutional government&rdquo; and notes that such desire and intention are reaffirmed and embodied in the Constitutions of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Congress also notes and specifically endorses the preamble to the U.S.-FSM Compact and the U.S.-RMI Compact, which affirms that the governments of the parties to the U.S.-FSM Compact and the U.S.-RMI Compact are founded upon respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. The Secretary of State shall include in the annual reports on the status of internationally recognized human rights in foreign countries, which are submitted to Congress pursuant to sections 2151n and 2304 of title 22, a full and complete report regarding the status of internationally recognized human rights in the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Immigration and passport security</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Naturalized citizens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rights of a bona fide naturalized citizen of the Federated States of Micronesia or the Republic of the Marshall Islands to enter the United States, to lawfully engage therein in occupations, and to establish residence therein as a nonimmigrant, to the extent such rights are provided under section 141 of the U.S.-FSM Compact and the U.S.-RMI Compact, shall not be deemed to extend to any such naturalized citizen with respect to whom circumstances associated with the acquisition of the status of a naturalized citizen are such as to allow a reasonable inference, on the part of appropriate officials of the United States and subject to United States procedural requirements, that such naturalized status was acquired primarily in order to obtain such rights.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Passports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the sense of Congress that up to $250,000 of the grant assistance provided to the Federated States of Micronesia pursuant to section 211(a)(4) of the U.S.-FSM Compact, and up to $250,000 of the grant assistance provided to the Republic of the Marshall Islands pursuant to section 211(a)(4) of the U.S.-RMI Compact (or a greater amount of the section 211(a)(4) grant, if mutually agreed between the Government of the United States and the government of the Federated States of Micronesia or the government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands), be used for the purpose of increasing the machine-readability and security of passports issued by such jurisdictions. It is further the sense of Congress that such funds be obligated by September 30, 2004 and in the amount and manner specified by the Secretary of State in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and, respectively, with the government of the Federated States of Micronesia and the government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The United States Government is authorized to require that passports used for the purpose of seeking admission under section 141 of the U.S.-FSM Compact and the U.S.-RMI Compact contain the security enhancements funded by such assistance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Information-sharing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the sense of Congress that the governments of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands develop, prior to October 1, 2004, the capability to provide reliable and timely information as may reasonably be required by the Government of the United States in enforcing criminal and security-related grounds of inadmissibility and deportability under the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended [8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.], and shall provide such information to the Government of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Transition; construction of sections 141(a)(3) and 141(a)(4) of the U.S.-FSM Compact and U.S.-RMI Compact</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The words &ldquo;the effective date of this Compact, as amended&rdquo; in sections 141(a)(3) and 141(a)(4) of the U.S.-FSM Compact and the U.S.-RMI Compact shall be construed to read, &ldquo;on the day prior to the enactment by the United States Congress of the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003.&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Nonalienation of lands</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress endorses and encourages the maintenance of the policies of the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands to regulate, in accordance with their Constitutions and laws, the alienation of permanent interests in real property so as to restrict the acquisition of such interests to persons of Federated States of Micronesia citizenship and the Republic of the Marshall Islands citizenship, respectively.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Nuclear waste disposal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In approving the U.S.-FSM Compact and the U.S.-RMI Compact, Congress understands that the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands will not permit any other government or any nongovernmental party to conduct, in the Republic of the Marshall Islands or in the Federated States of Micronesia, any of the activities specified in subsection (a) of section 314 of the U.S.-FSM Compact and the U.S.-RMI Compact.</p>
