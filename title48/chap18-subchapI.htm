<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) DOE radiological health care program; USDA agricultural and food programs</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Marshall Islands program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon the request of the Government of the Marshall Islands, the President (either through an appropriate department or agency of the United States or by contract with a United States firm) shall continue to provide special medical care and logistical support thereto for the remaining 174 members of the population of Rongelap and Utrik who were exposed to radiation resulting from the 1954 United States thermonuclear &ldquo;Bravo&rdquo; test, pursuant to Public Laws 95&ndash;134 and 96&ndash;205. Such medical care and its accompanying logistical support shall total $22,500,000 over the first 11 years of the Compact.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Agricultural and food programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon the request of the Government of the Marshall Islands, for the first fifteen years after the effective date of the Compact, the President (either through an appropriate department or agency of the United States or by contract with a United States firm or by a grant to the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands which may further contract only with a United States firm or a Republic of the Marshall Islands firm, the owners, officers and majority of the employees of which are citizens of the United States or the Republic of the Marshall Islands) shall provide technical and other assistance&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Payments under this subsection shall be provided to such extent or in such amounts as are necessary for services and other assistance provided pursuant to this subsection.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Rongelap</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Because Rongelap was directly affected by fallout from a 1954 United States thermonuclear test and because the Rongelap people remain unconvinced that it is safe to continue to live on Rongelap Island, it is the intent of Congress to take such steps (if any) as may be necessary to overcome the effects of such fallout on the habitability of Rongelap Island, and to restore Rongelap Island, if necessary, so that it can be safely inhabited. Accordingly, it is the expectation of the Congress that the Government of the Marshall Islands shall use such portion of the funds specified in Article II, section 1(e) of the subsidiary agreement for the implementation of section 177 of the Compact as are necessary for the purpose of contracting with a qualified scientist or group of scientists to review the data collected by the Department of Energy relating to radiation levels and other conditions on Rongelap Island resulting from the thermonuclear test. It is the expectation of the Congress that the Government of the Marshall Islands, after consultation with the people of Rongelap, shall select the party to review such data, and shall contract for such review and for submission of a report to the President of the United States and the Congress as to the results thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The purpose of the review referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be to establish whether the data cited in support of the conclusions as to the habitability of Rongelap Island, as set forth in the Department of Energy report entitled: &ldquo;The Meaning of Radiation for Those Atolls in the Northern Part of the Marshall Islands That Were Surveyed in 1978&rdquo;, dated <!-- PDFPage:213 -->November 1982, are adequate and whether such conclusions are fully supported by the data. If the party reviewing the data concludes that such conclusions as to habitability are fully supported by adequate data, the report to the President of the United States and the Congress shall so state. If the party reviewing the data concludes that the data are inadequate to support such conclusions as to habitability or that such conclusions as to habitability are not fully supported by the data, the Government of the Marshall Islands shall contract with an appropriate scientist or group of scientists to undertake a complete survey of radiation and other effects of the nuclear testing program relating to the habitability of Rongelap Island. Such sums as are necessary for such survey and report concerning the results thereof and as to steps needed to restore the habitability of Rongelap Island are authorized to be made available to the Government of the Marshall Islands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) It is the intent of Congress that such steps (if any) as are necessary to restore the habitability of Rongelap Island and return the Rongelap people to their homeland will be taken by the United States in consultation with the Government of the Marshall Islands and, in accordance with its authority under the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, the Rongelap local government council.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Services provided by the United States Public Health Service or any other United States agency pursuant to section 1(a) of Article II of the Agreement for the Implementation of Section 177 of the Compact (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;Section 177 Agreement&rdquo;) shall be only for services to the people of the Atolls of Bikini, Enewetak, Rongelap, and Utrik who were affected by the consequences of the United States nuclear testing program, pursuant to the program described in Public Law 95&ndash;134 and Public Law 96&ndash;205 and their descendants (and any other persons identified as having been so affected if such identification occurs in the manner described in such public laws). Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prejudicial to the views or policies of the Government of the Marshall Islands as to the persons affected by the consequences of the United States nuclear testing program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) At the end of the first year after the effective date of the Compact and at the end of each year thereafter, the providing agency or agencies shall return to the Government of the Marshall Islands any unexpended funds to be returned to the Fund Manager (as described in Article I of the Section 177 Agreement) to be covered into the Fund to be available for future use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Fund Manager shall retain the funds returned by the Government of the Marshall Islands pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, shall invest and manage such funds, and at the end of 15 years after the effective date of the Compact, shall make from the total amount so retained and the proceeds thereof annual disbursements sufficient to continue to make payments for the provision of health services as specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection to such extent as may be provided in contracts between the Government of the Marshall Islands and appropriate United States providers of such health services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Enjebi Community Trust Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of the Treasury shall establish on the books of the Treasury of the United States a fund having the status specified in Article V of the subsidiary agreement for the implementation of Section 177 of the Compact, to be known as the &ldquo;Enjebi Community Trust Fund&rdquo; (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;Fund&rdquo;), and shall credit to the Fund the amount of $7,500,000.

<p class="statutory-body">In approving the Compact, the Congress notes the conclusion in the Statement of Intent of the Report of The Future Political Status Commission of the Congress of Micronesia in July, 1969, that &ldquo;our recommendation of a free associated state is indissolubly linked to our desire for such a democratic, representative, constitutional government&rdquo; and notes that such desire and intention are reaffirmed and embodied in the Constitutions of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. The Congress also notes and specifically endorses the preamble to the Compact, which affirms that the governments of the parties to the Compact are founded upon respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. The Secretary of State shall include in the annual reports on the status of internationally recognized human rights in foreign countries, which are submitted to the Congress pursuant to sections 116 and 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151n, 2304], a full and complete report regarding the status of internationally recognized human rights in the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Nonalienation of lands</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress endorses and encourages the maintenance of the policies of the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Government of the Marshall Islands to regulate, in accordance with their Constitutions and laws, the alienation of permanent and long-term interests in real property so as to restrict the acquisition of such interests to persons of Federated States of Micronesia citizenship and Marshall Islands citizenship, respectively.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Nuclear waste disposal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In approving the Compact, the Congress understands that the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Government of the Marshall Islands will not permit any other government or any nongovernmental party to conduct, in the Marshall Islands or in the Federated States of Micronesia, any of the activities specified in subsection (a) of section 314 of the Compact.</p>

The Secretary of the Interior shall review and forward any such reports to the Congress with the comments of the Administration. The Secretary of the Interior shall, either directly or, subject to available technical assistance funds, through a grant to the affected jurisdiction, provide for a census of Micronesians at intervals no greater than 5 years from each decennial United States census using generally acceptable statistical methodologies for each of the impact jurisdictions where the Governor requests such assistance, except that the total expenditures to carry out this sentence may not exceed $300,000 in any year. Reports submitted pursuant to this paragraph (hereafter in this subsection referred to as &ldquo;reports&rdquo;) shall identify any adverse consequences resulting from the Compact and shall make recommendations for corrective action to eliminate those consequences. The reports shall pay particular attention to matters relating to trade, taxation, immigration, labor laws, minimum wages, social systems and infrastructure, and environmental regulation. With regard to immigration, the reports shall include statistics concerning the number of persons availing themselves of the rights described in section 141(a) of the Compact during the year covered by each report. With regard to trade, the reports shall include an analysis of the impact on the economy of American Samoa resulting from imports of canned tuna into the United States from the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Impact costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There are hereby authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years beginning after September 30, 1985, such sums as may be necessary to cover the costs, if any, incurred by the State of Hawaii, the territories of Guam and American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands resulting from any increased demands placed on educational and social services by immigrants from the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In clarification of Title One, Article II, section 121(b)(1) of the Compact:</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Human rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In approving the U.S.-FSM Compact and the U.S.-RMI Compact, Congress notes the conclusion in the Statement of Intent of the Report of The Future Political Status Commission of the Congress of Micronesia in July, 1969, that &ldquo;our recommendation of a free associated state is indissolubly linked to our desire for such a democratic, representative, constitutional government&rdquo; and notes that such desire and intention are reaffirmed and embodied in the Constitutions of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Congress also notes and specifically endorses the preamble to the U.S.-FSM Compact and the U.S.-RMI Compact, which affirms that the governments of the parties to the U.S.-FSM Compact and the U.S.-RMI Compact are founded upon respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. The Secretary of State shall include in the annual reports on the status of internationally recognized human rights in foreign countries, which are submitted to Congress pursuant to sections 2151n and 2304 of title 22, a full and complete report regarding the status of internationally recognized human rights in the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Immigration and passport security</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Naturalized citizens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rights of a bona fide naturalized citizen of the Federated States of Micronesia or the Republic of the Marshall Islands to enter the United States, to lawfully engage therein in occupations, and to establish residence therein as a nonimmigrant, to the extent such rights are provided under section 141 of the U.S.-FSM Compact and U.S.-RMI Compact, shall not be deemed to extend to any such naturalized citizen with respect to whom circumstances associated with the acquisition of the status of a naturalized citizen are such as to allow a reasonable inference, on the part of appropriate officials of the United States and subject to United States procedural requirements, that such naturalized status was acquired primarily in order to obtain such rights.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Passports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the sense of Congress that up to $250,000 of the grant assistance provided to the Federated States of Micronesia pursuant to section 211(a)(4) of the U.S.-FSM Compact, and up to $250,000 of the grant assistance provided to the Republic of the Marshall Islands pursuant to section 211(a)(4) of the U.S.-RMI Compact (or a greater amount of the section 211(a)(4) grant, if mutually agreed between the Government of the United States and the government of the Federated States of Micronesia or the government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands), be used for the purpose of increasing the machine-readability and security of passports issued by such jurisdictions. It is further the sense of Congress that such funds be obligated by September 30, 2004 and in the amount and manner specified by the Secretary of State in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and, respectively, with the government of the Federated States of Micronesia and the government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The United States Government is authorized to require that passports used for the purpose of seeking admission under section 141 of the U.S.-FSM Compact and the U.S.-RMI Compact contain the security enhancements funded by such assistance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Information-sharing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the sense of Congress that the governments of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands develop, prior to October 1, 2004, the capability to provide reliable and timely information as may reasonably be required by the Government of the United States in enforcing criminal and security-related grounds of inadmissibility and deportability under the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended [8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.], and shall provide such information to the Government of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Transition; construction of sections 141(a)(3) and 141(a)(4) of the U.S.-FSM Compact and U.S.-RMI Compact</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The words &ldquo;the effective date of this Compact, as amended&rdquo; in sections 141(a)(3) and 141(a)(4) of the U.S.-FSM Compact and the <!-- PDFPage:268 -->U.S.-RMI Compact shall be construed to read, &ldquo;on the day prior to the enactment by the United States Congress of the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003.&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Nonalienation of lands</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress endorses and encourages the maintenance of the policies of the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands to regulate, in accordance with their Constitutions and laws, the alienation of permanent interests in real property so as to restrict the acquisition of such interests to persons of Federated States of Micronesia citizenship and the Republic of the Marshall Islands citizenship, respectively.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Nuclear waste disposal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In approving the U.S.-FSM Compact and the U.S.-RMI Compact, Congress understands that the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands will not permit any other government or any nongovernmental party to conduct, in the Republic of the Marshall Islands or in the Federated States of Micronesia, any of the activities specified in subsection (a) of section 314 of the U.S.-FSM Compact and the U.S.-RMI Compact.</p>
