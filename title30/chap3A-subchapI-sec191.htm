All moneys received under the provisions of this chapter and the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 not otherwise disposed of by this section shall be credited to miscellaneous receipts. Payments to States under this section with respect to any moneys received by the United States, shall be made not later than the last business day of the month in which such moneys are warranted by the United States Treasury to the Secretary as having been received, except for any portion of such moneys which is under challenge and placed in a suspense account pending resolution of a dispute. Such warrants shall be issued by the United States Treasury not later than 10 days after receipt of such moneys by the Treasury. Moneys placed in a suspense account which are determined to be payable to a State shall be made not later than the last business day of the month in which such dispute is resolved. Any such amount placed in a suspense account pending resolution shall bear interest until the dispute is resolved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In calculating the amount to be paid to States during any fiscal year under this section or under any other provision of law requiring payment to a State of any revenues derived from the leasing of any onshore lands or interest in land owned by the United States for the production of the same types of minerals leasable under this chapter or of geothermal steam, 50 percent of the portion of the enacted appropriation of the Department of the Interior and any other agency during the preceding fiscal year allocable to the administration of all laws providing for the leasing of any onshore lands or interest in land owned by the United States for the production of the same types of minerals leasable under this chapter or of geothermal steam, and to enforcement of such laws, shall be deducted from the receipts derived under those laws in approximately equal amounts each month (subject to paragraph (4)) prior to the division and distribution of such receipts between the States and the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The proportion of the deduction provided in paragraph (1) allocable to each State shall be determined by dividing the monies disbursed to the State during the preceding fiscal year derived from onshore mineral leasing referred to in paragraph (1) in that State by the total money disbursed to States during the preceding fiscal year from such onshore mineral leasing in all States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the event the deduction apportioned to any State under this subsection exceeds 50 percent of the Secretary of the Interior's estimate of the amounts attributable to onshore mineral leasing referred to in paragraph (1) within that State during the preceding fiscal year, the deduction from receipts received from leases in that State shall be limited to such estimated amounts and the total amount to be deducted from such onshore mineral leasing receipts shall be reduced accordingly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the amount otherwise deductible under this subsection in any month from the portion of receipts to be distributed to a State exceeds the amount payable to the State during that month, any amount exceeding the amount payable shall be carried forward and deducted from amounts payable to the State in subsequent months. If any amount remains to be carried forward at the end of the fiscal year, such amount shall not be deducted from any disbursements in any subsequent fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) All deductions to be made pursuant to this subsection shall be made in full during the fiscal year in which such deductions were incurred.</p>
