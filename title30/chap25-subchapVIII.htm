<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Designation by Secretary of Energy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Energy, after consultation with the National Academy of Engineering, shall designate thirteen institutions of higher education at which university coal research laboratories will be established and operated. Ten such designations shall be made as provided in subsection (e) of this section and the remaining three shall be made in fiscal year 1980.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In making designations under this section, the Secretary of Energy shall consider the following criteria:</p>
