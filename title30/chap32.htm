<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in order to promote energy independence and meet the increasing demand for energy, the United States will require a diversified portfolio of substantially increased quantities of electricity, natural gas, and transportation fuels;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) according to the report submitted to Congress by the National Research Council entitled &ldquo;Charting the Future of Methane Hydrate Research in the United States&rdquo;, the total United States resources of gas hydrates have <!-- PDFPage:358 -->been estimated to be on the order of 200,000 trillion cubic feet;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) according to the report of the National Commission on Energy Policy entitled &ldquo;Ending the Energy Stalemate&mdash;A Bipartisan Strategy to Meet America's Energy Challenge&rdquo;, and dated December 2004, the United States may be endowed with over one-fourth of the methane hydrate deposits in the world;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) according to the Energy Information Administration, a shortfall in natural gas supply from conventional and unconventional sources is expected to occur in or about 2020; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the National Academy of Sciences states that methane hydrate may have the potential to alleviate the projected shortfall in the natural gas supply.</p>
