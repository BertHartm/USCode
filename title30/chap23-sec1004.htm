<h4 class="paragraph-head">(a) Royalty provision for percentage of amount or value of steam or other form of heat or energy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">a royalty of not less than 10 per centum or more than 15 per centum of the amount or value of steam, or any other form of heat or energy derived from production under the lease and sold or utilized by the lessee or reasonably susceptible to sale or utilization by the lessee;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(b) Royalty provision for percentage of value of byproduct; rate for certain mineral byproducts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">a royalty of not more than 5 per centum of the value of any byproduct derived from production under the lease and sold or utilized or reasonably susceptible of sale or utilization by the lessee, except that as to any byproduct which is a mineral named in section 1 of the Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, as amended (30 U.S.C. 181), the rate of royalty for such mineral shall be the same as that provided in that Act [30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.] and the maximum rate of royalty for such mineral shall not exceed the maximum royalty applicable under that Act;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(c) Annual rental; advance payment; amount; termination of lease for nonpayment; deficiency payments: notice and payment of deficiency; reinstatement of lease: reasons and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">payment in advance of an annual rental of not less than $1 per acre or fraction thereof for each year of the lease. If there is no well on the leased lands capable of producing geothermal resources in commercial quantities, the failure to pay rental on or before the anniversary date shall terminate the lease by operation of law: <em>Provided, however</em>, That whenever the Secretary discovers that the rental payment due under a lease is paid timely but the amount of the payment is deficient because of an error or other reason and the deficiency is nominal, as determined by the Secretary pursuant to regulations prescribed by him, he shall notify the lessee of the deficiency and such lease shall not automatically terminate unless the lessee fails to pay the deficiency within the period prescribed in the notice: <em>Provided further</em>, That, where any lease has been terminated automatically by operation of law under this section for failure to pay rental timely and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Interior that the failure to pay timely the lease rental was justifiable or not due to a lack of reasonable diligence, he in his judgment may reinstate the lease if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(1) a petition for reinstatement, together with the required rental, is filed with the Secretary of the Interior; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(2) no valid lease has been issued affecting any of the lands in the terminated lease prior to the filing of the petition for reinstatement; and</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(d) Royalties in lieu of rentals for producing leases; amount; initial payment; value of unsold geothermal steam and byproducts; consideration of exploration and production costs and use value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">a minimum royalty of $2 per acre or fraction thereof in lieu of rental payable at the expiration of each lease year for each producing lease, commencing with the lease year beginning on or after the commencement of production in commercial quantities. For the purpose of determining royalties hereunder the value of any geothermal steam and byproduct used by the lessee and not sold and reasonably susceptible of sale shall be determined by the Secretary, who shall take into consideration the cost of exploration and production and the economic value of the resource in terms of its ultimate utilization.</p>
