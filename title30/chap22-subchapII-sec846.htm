Within six months after December 30, 1969, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall establish, and the Secretary shall publish, as provided in section 811 of this title, proposed mandatory health standards establishing maximum noise exposure levels for all underground coal mines.

In meeting such standard under this section, the operator shall not require the use of any protective device or system, including personal devices, which the Secretary or his authorized representative finds to be hazardous or cause a hazard to the miners in such mine.</p>
