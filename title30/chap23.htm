<p class="statutory-body-1em">(a) &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; means the Secretary of the Interior;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(b) &ldquo;geothermal lease&rdquo; means a lease issued under authority of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(c) &ldquo;geothermal resources&rdquo; means (i) all products of geothermal processes, embracing indigenous steam, hot water and hot brines; (ii) steam and other gases, hot water and hot brines resulting from water, gas, or other fluids artificially introduced into geothermal formations; (iii) heat or other associated energy found in geothermal formations; and (iv) any byproduct derived from them;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(d) &ldquo;byproduct&rdquo; means any mineral or minerals (exclusive of oil, hydrocarbon gas, and helium) which are found in solution or in association with geothermal steam and which have a value of less than 75 per centum of the value of the geothermal steam or are not, because of quantity, quality, or technical difficulties in extraction and production, of sufficient value to warrant extraction and production by themselves;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(e) &ldquo;known geothermal resources area&rdquo; means an area in which the geology, nearby discoveries, competitive interests, or other indicia would, in the opinion of the Secretary, engender a belief in men who are experienced in the subject matter that the prospects for extraction of geothermal steam or associated geothermal resources are good enough to warrant expenditures of money for that purpose.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) operation or production pursuant to the communitization agreement shall be treated as operation or production with respect to each tract of land that is subject to the communitization agreement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be based on scientific evidence; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) occur only if the elimination is determined by the Secretary to be for the purpose of conserving and properly managing the geothermal resource.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Extension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any land eliminated under this subsection shall be eligible for an extension under section 1005(g) of this title if the land meets the requirements for the extension.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Holdings or control</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each lease operated under an approved drilling or development contract, and interest under the contract, shall be excepted in determining holdings or control under section 1006 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) requiring the lessee to suspend activity on the lease if the Secretary determines that ongoing exploration, development or utilization activities are having a significant adverse effect on a significant thermal feature within a unit of the National Park System until such time as the significant adverse effect is eliminated. The stipulation shall provide for the termination of the lease by the Secretary if the significant adverse effect cannot be eliminated within a reasonable period of time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Lands administered by Department of Agriculture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture shall consider the effects on significant thermal features within units of the National Park System in determining whether to consent to leasing under this chapter on national forest lands or other lands administered by the Department of Agriculture available for leasing under this chapter, including public, withdrawn, and acquired lands.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) USGS program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the United States Geological Survey, and in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, shall establish a cooperative Government-private sector program with respect to hot dry rock geothermal energy resources on public lands (as such term is defined in section 1702(e) of title 43) and lands managed by the Department of Agriculture, other than any such public or other lands that are withdrawn from geothermal leasing. Such program shall include, but shall not be limited to, activities to identify, select, and classify those areas throughout the United States that have a high potential for hot dry rock geothermal energy production and activities to develop and disseminate information regarding the utilization of such areas for hot dry rock energy production. Such information may include information regarding field test processes and techniques for assuring that hot dry rock geothermal energy development projects are developed in an economically feasible manner without adverse environmental consequences. Utilizing the information developed by the Secretary, together with information developed in connection with other related programs carried out by other Federal agencies, the Secretary, acting through the United States Geological Survey, may also enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with any public or private entity to provide assistance to any such entity to enable such entity to carry out additional projects with respect to the utilization of hot dry rock geothermal energy resources which will further the purposes of this section.</p>
