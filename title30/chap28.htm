<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the availability of materials is essential for national security, economic well-being, and industrial production;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the availability of materials is affected by the stability of foreign sources of essential industrial materials, instability of materials markets, international competition and demand for materials, the need for energy and materials conservation, and the enhancement of environmental quality;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) extraction, production, processing, use, recycling, and disposal of materials are closely linked with national concerns for energy and the environment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the United States is strongly interdependent with other nations through international trade in materials and other products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) technological innovation and research and development are important factors which contribute to the availability and use of materials;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the United States lacks a coherent national materials policy and a coordinated program to assure the availability of materials critical for national economic well-being, national defense, and industrial production, including interstate commerce and foreign trade; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:328 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) notwithstanding the enactment of section 21a of this title, the United States does not have a coherent national materials and minerals policy.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) As used in this chapter, the term &ldquo;materials&rdquo; means substances, including minerals, of current or potential use that will be needed to supply the industrial, military, and essential civilian needs of the United States in the production of goods or services, including those which are primarily imported or for which there is a prospect of shortages or uncertain supply, or which present opportunities in terms of new physical properties, use, recycling, disposal or substitution, with the exclusion of food and of energy fuels used as such.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that it is the continuing policy of the United States to promote an adequate and stable supply of materials necessary to maintain national security, economic well-being and industrial production with appropriate attention to a long-term balance between resource production, energy use, a healthy environment, natural resources conservation, and social needs. The Congress further declares that implementation of this policy requires that the President shall, through the Executive Office of the President, coordinate the responsible departments and agencies to, among other measures&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) identify materials needs and assist in the pursuit of measures that would assure the availability of materials critical to commerce, the economy, and national security;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establish a mechanism for the coordination and evaluation of Federal materials programs, including those involving research and development so as to complement related efforts by the private sector as well as other domestic and international agencies and organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) establish a long-range assessment capability concerning materials demands, supply and needs, and provide for the policies and programs necessary to meet those needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) promote a vigorous, comprehensive, and coordinated program of materials research and development consistent with the policies and priorities set forth in the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. 6601 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) promote cooperative research and development programs with other nations for the equitable and frugal use of materials and energy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) promote and encourage private enterprise in the development of economically sound and stable domestic materials industries; and</p>
