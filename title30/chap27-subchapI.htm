<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization; purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Energy (hereafter in this chapter referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) is authorized to make a loan to any person, from funds appropriated (pursuant to this subchapter) to the Geothermal Resources Development Fund established under section 1144 of this title, to assist such person in undertaking and carrying out a project which (1) is designed to explore for or determine the economic viability of a geothermal reservoir and (2) consists of surface exploration and the drilling of one or more exploratory wells.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Repayment rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (c) of this section and to section 1513(b) of this title, any loan under subsection (a) of this section shall be repayable out of revenue from production of the geothermal energy reservoir with respect to which the loan was made, at a rate, in any year, not to exceed 20 per centum of the gross revenue from the reservoir in that year; except that if any disposi<!-- PDFPage:322 -->tion of the geothermal rights to the reservoir is made to one or more other persons by the borrower, the full amount of the loan balance outstanding, or so much of the loan balance outstanding as is equal to the full amount of the compensation realized by the borrower upon such disposition, whichever is less, shall be repaid immediately. In any case where the reservoir is confirmed (as determined by the Secretary), the Secretary may impute a reasonable revenue for purposes of determining repayment if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) reasonable efforts are not made to put such reservoir in commercial operation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the borrower (or any such other person) utilizes the resources of the reservoir without a sale of the energy or geothermal energy resources therefrom, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a sale of energy or geothermal energy resources from the reservoir is made for an unreasonably low price;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that no such imputation of revenue shall be made during the three-year period immediately following such reservoir confirmation. In the event of failure to begin production of revenue (or, where no sale of energy or geothermal energy resources is made, to begin production of energy for commercial use) within five years after the date of such reservoir confirmation, the Secretary may take action to recover the value, not to exceed the amount of the unpaid balance of the loan plus any accrued interest thereon, of any assets of the project in question, including resource rights.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cancellation of unpaid balance and accrued interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may at any time cancel the unpaid balance and any accrued interest on any loan made under this section if he determines, on the basis of evidence presented by the loan recipient or otherwise, that the geothermal energy reservoir with respect to which the loan was made has characteristics which make that reservoir economically or technically unacceptable for commercial development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Person&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this subchapter, the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; includes municipalities, electric cooperatives, industrial development agencies, nonprofit organizations, and Indian tribes, as well as the entities included within such term under section 1 of title 1.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The amount of any loan made under section 1511(a) of this title with respect to a project described in that section shall not exceed 50 percent of the cost of such project; except that if the loan is made to a person proposing to make application of the resources of the reservoir involved primarily for space heating or cooling or process heat for one or more structures or facilities then existing or under construction, the loan may be in any amount up to 90 per centum of such cost. In any event no loan shall be made in an amount in excess of $3,000,000.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Each loan made under section 1511 of this title shall bear interest at a discount or interest rate equal to the rate in effect (at the time the loan is made) for water resources planning projects under section 80 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 1962(d)&ndash;17(a)).<sup><a href="#1513_1_target" name="1513_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Each such loan shall be for a term which the Secretary deems appropriate, except that no loan term shall exceed twenty years beyond the date on which production of energy or geothermal energy resources begins from the reservoir involved. If revenues are inadequate (as determined by the Secretary) to fully repay the principal and accrued interest within twenty years after production begins, any remaining unpaid amounts shall be forgiven.</p>
