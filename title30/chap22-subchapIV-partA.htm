<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Congress finds and declares that there are a significant number of coal miners living today <!-- PDFPage:176 -->who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis arising out of employment in one or more of the Nation's coal mines; that there are a number of survivors of coal miners whose deaths were due to this disease; and that few States provide benefits for death or disability due to this disease to coal miners or their surviving dependents. It is, therefore, the purpose of this subchapter to provide benefits, in cooperation with the States, to coal miners who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis and to the surviving dependents of miners whose death was due to such disease; and to ensure that in the future adequate benefits are provided to coal miners and their dependents in the event of their death or total disability due to pneumoconiosis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) This subchapter may be cited as the &ldquo;Black Lung Benefits Act&rdquo;.</p>
