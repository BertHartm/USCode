<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Assessment of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person subject to section 1461 of this title who is found by the Administrator, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5, to have committed any act prohibited by section 1461 of this title shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty. The amount of the civil penalty shall not exceed $25,000 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate offense. The amount of such civil penalty shall be assessed by the Administrator by written notice. In determining the amount of such penalty, the Administrator shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the prohibited act committed and, with respect to the violator, any history of prior offenses, good faith demonstrated in attempting to achieve timely compliance after being cited for the violation, and such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Review of civil penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person subject to section 1461 of this title against whom a civil penalty is assessed under subsection (a) of this section may obtain review thereof in an appropriate district court of the United States by filing a notice of appeal in such court within 30 days from the date of such order and by simultaneously sending a copy of such notice by certified mail to the Administrator. The Administrator shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record upon which the particular violation was found and such penalty was imposed, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. The findings and order of the Administrator shall be set aside by such court if they are not found to be supported by substantial evidence, as provided in section 706(2)(E) of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Action upon failure to pay assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any person subject to section 1461 of this title fails to pay a civil penalty assessed against such person after the penalty has become final, or after the appropriate court has entered final judgment in favor of the Administrator, the Administrator shall refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States, who shall recover the civil penalty assessed in any appropriate district court of the United States. In such action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Compromise or other action by the Administrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty which is subject to imposition or which has been imposed under this section unless an action brought under subsection (b) or (c) of this section is pending in a court of the United States.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Creation of Trust Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is established in the Treasury of the United States a trust fund to be known as the &ldquo;Deep Seabed Revenue Sharing Trust Fund&rdquo; (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Trust Fund&rdquo;), consisting of such amounts as may be appropriated or credited to the Trust Fund as provided in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Transfer to Trust Fund of amounts equivalent to certain taxes</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There are hereby appropriated to the Trust Fund amounts determined by the Secretary of <!-- PDFPage:325 -->the Treasury to be equivalent to the amounts of the taxes received in the Treasury under section 4495&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1472_1_target" name="1472_1">1</a></sup> of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Method of transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amounts appropriated by paragraph (1) shall be transferred at least quarterly from the general fund of the Treasury to the Trust Fund on the basis of estimates made by the Secretary of the Treasury of the amounts referred to in paragraph (1) received in the Treasury. Proper adjustments shall be made in the amounts subsequently transferred to the extent prior estimates were in excess of or less than the amount required to be transferred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Management of Trust Fund</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to hold the Trust Fund, and to report to the Congress for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, and each fiscal year thereafter on the financial condition and the results of the operations of the Trust Fund during the preceding year and on its expected condition and operations during the fiscal year and the next five fiscal years after the fiscal year. Such report shall be printed as a House document of the session of the Congress to which the report is made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Investment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to invest such portion of the Trust Fund as is not, in his judgment, required to meet current withdrawals. Such investments may be made only in interest-bearing obligations of the United States. For such purpose, such obligations may be acquired (i) on original issue at the issue price, or (ii) by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Sale of obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any obligation acquired by the Trust Fund may be sold by the Secretary at the market price.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Interest on certain proceeds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, any obligations held in the Trust Fund shall be credited to and form a part of the Trust Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Expenditures from Trust Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an international deep seabed treaty is ratified by and in effect with respect to the United States on or before the date ten years after June 28, 1980, amounts in the Trust Fund shall be available, as provided by appropriations Acts, for making contributions required under such treaty for purposes of the sharing among nations of the revenues from deep seabed mining. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to authorize any program or other activity not otherwise authorized by law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Use of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an international deep seabed treaty is not in effect with respect to the United States on or before the date ten years after June 28, 1980, amounts in the Trust Fund shall be available for such purposes as Congress may hereafter provide by law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) International deep seabed treaty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;international deep seabed treaty&rdquo; has the meaning given to such term by section 4498(b)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1472_1_target" name="1472_1">1</a></sup> of title 26.</p>
