<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;byproduct&rdquo; means any mineral or minerals which are found in solution or in association with geothermal resources and which have a value of less than 75 percent of the value of the geothermal steam and associated geothermal resources or are not, because of quantity, quality, or technical difficulties in extraction and production, of sufficient value to warrant extraction and production by themselves;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) &ldquo;pilot plant&rdquo; means an experimental unit of small size used for early evaluation and development of new or improved processes and to obtain technical, engineering, and cost data;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) &ldquo;demonstration plant&rdquo; means a complete facility which produces electricity, heat energy, or useful byproducts for commercial disposal from geothermal resources and which will make a significant contribution to the knowledge of full-size technology, plant operation, and process economics;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the term &ldquo;Project&rdquo; means the Geothermal Energy Coordination and Management Project established by section 1121(a) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the term &ldquo;fund&rdquo; means the Geothermal Resources Development Fund established by section 1144(a) of this title; and</p>
