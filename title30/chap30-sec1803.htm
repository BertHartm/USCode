<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8)(A) to prepare a report providing a domestic inventory of critical materials with projections on the prospective needs of Government and industry for these materials, including a long-range assessment, prepared in conjunction with the Office of Science and Technology Policy in accordance with the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act of 1980, and in conjunction with such other Government departments or agencies as may be considered necessary, of the prospective major critical materials problems which the United States is likely to confront in the immediate years ahead and providing advice as to how these problems may best be addressed, with the first such report being due on April 1, 1985, and (B) review and update such report and assessment as appropriate and report thereon to the Congress at least biennially; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) to recommend to the Congress such changes in current policies, activities, and regulations of the Federal Government, and such legislation, as may be considered necessary to carry out the intent of this chapter and the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act of 1980.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Specific authorities of Council</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out its responsibilities under this section the Council shall have the authority&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to establish such special advisory panels as it considers necessary, with each such panel consisting of representatives of industry, academia, and other members of the private sector, not to exceed ten members, and being limited in scope of subject and duration; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to establish and convene such Federal interagency committees as it considers necessary in carrying out the intent of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Collaboration and cooperation of Council and Federal agencies with responsibilities related to materials</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In seeking to achieve the goals of this chapter and related Acts, the Council and other Federal departments and agencies with responsibilities or jurisdiction related to materials or materials policy, including the National Security Council, the Council on Environmental Quality, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy, shall work collaboratively and in close cooperation.</p>
