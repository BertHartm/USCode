<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Filing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On and after January 1, 1974, any claim for benefits for death or total disability due to pneumoconiosis shall be filed pursuant to the applicable State workmen's compensation law, except that during any period when miners or their surviving widows, children, parents, brothers, or sisters, as the case may be, are not covered by a State workmen's compensation law which provides adequate coverage for pneumoconiosis, and in any case in which benefits based upon eligibility under paragraph (5) of section 921(c) of this title are involved.<sup><a href="#931_1_target" name="931_1">1</a></sup> they shall be entitled to claim benefits under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adequacy of compensation; listing of States providing adequate compensation; requisites for listing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this section, a State workmen's compensation law shall not be deemed to provide adequate coverage for pneumoconiosis during any period unless it is included in the list of State laws found by the Secretary to provide such adequate coverage during such period. The Secretary shall, no later than October 1, 1972, publish in the Federal Register a list of State workmen's compensation laws which provide adequate coverage for pneumoconiosis and shall revise and republish in the Federal Register such list from time to time, as may be appropriate to reflect changes in such State laws due to legislation or judicial or administrative interpretation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall include a State workmen's compensation law on such list during any period only if he finds that during such period under such law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) benefits must be paid for total disability or death of a miner due to pneumoconiosis, except that (i) such law shall not be required to provide such benefits where the miner's last employment in a coal mine terminated before the Secretary's approval of the State law pursuant to this section; and (ii) each operator of a coal mine shall secure the payment of benefits pursuant to section 933 of this title with respect to any miner whose last employment in a coal mine terminated before the Secretary's approval of the State law pursuant to this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount of such cash benefits is substantially equivalent to or greater than the amount of benefits prescribed by section 922(a) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the standards for determining death or total disability due to pneumoconiosis are substantially equivalent to section 902(f) of this title and to those standards established under this part, and by the regulations of the Secretary promulgated under this part;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) any claim for benefits on account of total disability of a miner due to pneumoconiosis is deemed to be timely filed if such claim is filed within three years after a medical determination of total disability due to pneumoconiosis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) there are in effect provisions with respect to prior and successor operators which are substantially equivalent to the provisions contained in section 932(i) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) there are applicable such other provisions, regulations or interpretations, which are consistent with the provisions contained in Public Law 803, 69th Congress (44 Stat. 1424, approved March 4, 1927), as amended [33 U.S.C. 901 et seq.], which are applicable under section 932(a) of this title, but are not inconsistent with any of the criteria set forth in subparagraphs (A) through (E) of this paragraph, as the Secretary, in accordance with regulations promulgated by him, determines to be necessary or appropriate to assure adequate compensation for total disability or death due to pneumoconiosis.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The action of the Secretary in including or failing to include any State workmen's compensation law on such list shall be subject to judicial review exclusively in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the State is located or the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Publication in Federal Register; review of listings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Final regulations required for implementation of any amendments to this part shall be promulgated and published in the Federal Register at the earliest practicable date after the date of enactment of such amendments, and in no event later than the end of the sixth month following the month in which such amendments are enacted.</p>

In administering this part, the Secretary is authorized to prescribe in the Federal Register such additional provisions, not inconsistent with those specifically excluded by this subsection, as he deems necessary to provide for the payment of benefits by such operator to persons entitled thereto as provided in this part and thereafter those provisions shall be applicable to such operator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Liability of operators</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During any such period each such operator shall be liable for and shall secure the payment of benefits, as provided in this section and section 933 of this title. An employer, other than an operator of a coal mine, shall not be required to secure the payment of such benefits with respect to any employee of such employer to the extent such employee is engaged in the transportation of coal or in coal mine construction. Upon determination by the Secretary of the eligibility of the employee, the Secretary may require such employer to secure a bond or otherwise guarantee the payment of such benefits to the employee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Persons entitled to benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Benefits shall be paid during such period by each such operator under this section to the categories of persons entitled to benefits under section 922(a) of this title in accordance with the regulations of the Secretary applicable under this section: <em>Provided</em>, That, except as provided in subsection (i) of this section, no benefit shall be payable by any operator on account of death or total disability due to pneumoconiosis (1) which did not arise, at least in part, out of employment in a mine during a period after December 31, 1969, when it was operated by such operator; or (2) which was the subject of a claim denied before March 1, 1978, and which is or has been approved in accordance with the provisions of section 945&nbsp;<sup><a href="#932_2_target" name="932_2">2</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Monthly payments; amounts; accrual of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Benefits payable under this section shall be paid on a monthly basis and, except as otherwise provided in this section, such payments shall be equal to the amounts specified in section 922(a) of this title. If payment is not made within the time required, interest shall accrue to such amounts at the rates set forth in section 934(b)(5) of this title for interest owed to the fund. With respect to payments withheld pending final adjudication of liability, in the case of claims filed on or after the effective date of the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981, such interest shall commence to accumulate 30 days after the date of the determination that such an award should be made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Conditions upon payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No payment of benefits shall be required under this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) except pursuant to a claim filed therefor in such manner, in such form, and containing such information, as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:182 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for any period prior to January 1, 1974.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation on filing of claims</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) March 1, 1978.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Reduction of monthly benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of benefits payable under this section shall be reduced, on a monthly or other appropriate basis, by the amount of any compensation received under or pursuant to any Federal or State workmen's compensation law because of death or disability due to pneumoconiosis. In addition, the amount of benefits payable under this section with respect to any claim filed on or after the effective date of the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981 shall be reduced, on a monthly or other appropriate basis, by the amount by which such benefits would be reduced on account of excess earnings of such miner under section 403(b) through (<em>l</em>) of title 42 if the amount paid were a benefit payable under section 402 of title 42.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Promulgation of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Labor shall by regulation establish standards, which may include appropriate presumptions, for determining whether pneumoconiosis arose out of employment in a particular coal mine or mines. The Secretary may also, by regulation, establish standards for apportioning liability for benefits under this subsection among more than one operator, where such apportionment is appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Subsequent operators&rsquo; liability for benefit payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) During any period in which this section is applicable to the operator of a coal mine who on or after January 1, 1970, acquired such mine or substantially all the assets thereof, from a person (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as a &ldquo;prior operator&rdquo;) who was an operator of such mine, or owner of such assets on or after January 1, 1970, such operator shall be liable for and shall, in accordance with section 933 of this title, secure the payment of all benefits which would have been payable by the prior operator under this section with respect to miners previously employed by such prior operator as if the acquisition had not occurred and the prior operator had continued to be an operator of a coal mine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this subsection shall relieve any prior operator of any liability under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the provisions of this paragraph shall apply to corporate reorganizations, liquidations, and such other transactions as are specified in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If an operator ceases to exist by reason of a reorganization or other transaction or series of transactions which involves a change in identity, form, or place of business or organization, however effected, the successor operator or other corporate or business entity resulting from such reorganization or other change shall be treated as the operator to whom this section applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If an operator ceases to exist by reason of a liquidation into a parent or successor corporation, the parent or successor corporation shall be treated as the operator to whom this section applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If an operator ceases to exist by reason of a sale of substantially all his or her assets, or as the result of a merger, consolidation, or division, the successor operator, corporation, or other business entity shall be treated as the operator to whom this section applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In any case in which there is a determination under section 9501(d) of title 26 that no operator is liable for the payment of benefits to a claimant, nothing in this subsection may be construed to require the payment of benefits to a claimant by or on behalf of any operator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Failure of operators to secure benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, section 9501 of title 26 shall govern the payment of benefits in cases&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) described in section 9501(d)(1) of title 26;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in which the miner's last coal mine employment was before January 1, 1970; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in which there was a claim denied before March 1, 1978, and such claim is or has been approved in accordance with the provisions of section 945&nbsp;<sup><a href="#932_2_target" name="932_2">2</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Secretary as party in claim proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall be a party in any proceeding relative to a claim for benefits under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Filing of new claims or refiling or revalidation of claims of miners already determined eligible at time of death</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In no case shall the eligible survivors of a miner who was determined to be eligible to receive benefits under this subchapter at the time of his or her death be required to file a new claim for benefits, or refile or otherwise revalidate the claim of such miner, except with respect to a claim filed under this part on or after the effective date of the Black Lung Benefits Amendments of 1981,.<sup><a href="#932_3_target" name="932_3">3</a></sup></p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;fund&rdquo; has the meaning set forth in section 902(h) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an amount is paid out of the fund to an individual entitled to benefits under section 932 of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary determines, under the provisions of sections 932 and 933 of this title, that an operator was required to secure the payment of all or a portion of such benefits,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the operator is liable to the United States for repayment to the fund of the amount of such benefits the payment of which is properly attributed to him plus interest thereon. No operator or representative of operators may bring any proceeding, or intervene in any proceeding, held for the purpose of determining claims for benefits to be paid by the fund, except that nothing in this section shall affect the rights, duties, or liabilities of any operator in proceedings under section 932 or section 933 of this title. In a case where no operator responsibility is assigned pursuant to sections 932 and 933 of this title, a determination by the Secretary that the fund is liable for the payment of benefits shall be final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If any operator liable to the fund under paragraph (1) refuses to pay, after demand, the amount of such liability (including interest), then there shall be a lien in favor of the United States for such amount upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such operator. The lien arises on the date on which such liability is finally determined, and continues until it is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as otherwise provided under this subsection, the priority of the lien shall be determined in the same manner as under section 6323 of title 26. That section shall be applied for such purposes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) by substituting &ldquo;lien imposed by section 424(b)(2) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977&rdquo; for &ldquo;lien imposed by section 6321&rdquo;; &ldquo;operator liability lien&rdquo; for &ldquo;tax lien&rdquo;; &ldquo;operator&rdquo; for &ldquo;taxpayer&rdquo;; &ldquo;lien arising under section 424(b)(2) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977&rdquo; for &ldquo;assessment of the tax&rdquo;; &ldquo;payment of the liability is made to the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund&rdquo; for &ldquo;satisfaction of a levy pursuant to section 6332(b)&rdquo;; and &ldquo;satisfaction of operator liability&rdquo; for &ldquo;collection of any tax under this title&rdquo; each place such terms appear; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) by treating all references to the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; as references to the Secretary of Labor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, the lien imposed under paragraph (2) shall be treated in the same manner as a lien for taxes due and owing to the United States for purposes of the Bankruptcy Act or section 3713(a) of title 31.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of applying section 6323(a) of title 26 to determine the priority between the lien imposed under paragraph (2) and the Federal tax lien, each lien shall be treated as a judgment lien arising as of the time notice of such lien is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this subsection, notice of the lien imposed under paragraph (2) shall be filed in the same manner as under subsections (f) and (g) of section 6323 of title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) In any case where there has been a refusal or neglect to pay the liability imposed under paragraph (2), the Secretary may bring a civil action in a district court of the United States to enforce the lien of the United States under this section with respect to such liability or to subject any property, of whatever nature, of the operator, or in which he has any right, title, or interest, to the payment of such liability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The liability imposed by paragraph (1) may be collected at a proceeding in court if the proceeding is commenced within 6 years after the date on which the liability was finally determined, or before the expiration of any period for collection agreed upon in writing by the operator and the United States before the expiration of such 6-year period. The running of the period of limitation provided under this subparagraph shall be suspended for any period during which the assets of the operator are in the custody or control of any court of the United States, or of any State, or the District of Columbia, and for 6 months thereafter, and for any period during which the operator is outside the United States if such period of absence is for a continuous period of at least 6 months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The rate of interest under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for any period during calendar year 1982, shall be 15 percent, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for any period after calendar year 1982, shall be the rate established by section 6621 of title 26 which is in effect for such period.</p>
