<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">It is the intent of Congress&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that any international agreement to which the United States becomes a party should, in addition to promoting other national oceans objectives&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provide assured and nondiscriminatory access, under reasonable terms and conditions, to the hard mineral resources of the deep seabed for United States citizens, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide security of tenure by recognizing the rights of United States citizens who have undertaken exploration or commercial recovery under subchapter I of this chapter before such agreement enters into force with respect to the United States to continue their operations under terms, conditions, and restrictions which do not impose significant new economic burdens upon such citizens with respect to such operations with the effect of preventing the continuation of such operations on a viable economic basis;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that the extent to which any such international agreement conforms to the provisions of paragraph (1) should be determined by the totality of the provisions of such agreement, including, but not limited to, the practical implications for the security of investments of any discretionary powers granted to an international regulatory body, the structures and decisionmaking procedures of such body, the availability of impartial and effective procedures for the settlement of disputes, and any features that tend to discriminate against exploration and commercial recovery activities undertaken by United States citizens; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that this chapter should be transitional pending&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the adoption of an international agreement at the Third United Nations Con<!-- PDFPage:318 -->ference on the Law of the Sea, and the entering into force of such agreement, or portions thereof, with respect to the United States, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if such adoption is not forthcoming, the negotiation of a multilateral or other treaty concerning the deep seabed, and the entering into force of such treaty with respect to the United States.</p>
