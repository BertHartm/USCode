<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1101. Congressional findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress hereby finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Nation is currently suffering a critical shortage of environmentally acceptable forms of energy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the inadequate organizational structures and levels of funding for energy research have limited the Nation's current and future options for meeting energy needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) electric energy is a clean and convenient form of energy at the location of its use and is the only practicable form of energy in some modern applications, but the demand for electric energy in every region of the United States is taxing all of the alternative energy sources presently available and is projected to increase; some of the sources available for electric power generation are already in short supply, and the development and use of other sources presently involve undesirable environmental impacts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the Nation's critical energy problems can be solved only if a national commitment is made to dedicate the necessary financial resources, and enlist the cooperation of the private and public sectors, in developing geothermal resources and other nonconventional sources of energy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the conventional geothermal resources which are presently being used have limited total potential; but geothermal resources which are different from those presently being used, and which have extremely large energy content, are known to exist;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) some geothermal resources contain energy in forms other than heat; examples are methane and extremely high pressures available upon release as kinetic energy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) some geothermal resources contain valuable byproducts such as potable water and mineral compounds which should be processed and recovered as national resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) technologies are not presently available for the development of most of these geothermal resources, but technologies for the generation of electric energy from geothermal resources are potentially economical and environmentally desirable, and the development of geothermal resources offers possibilities of process energy and other nonelectric applications;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) much of the known geothermal resources exist on the public lands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Federal financial assistance is necessary to encourage the extensive exploration, research, and development in geothermal resources which will bring these technologies to the point of commercial application;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) the advancement of technology with the cooperation of private industry for the production of useful forms of energy from geothermal resources is important with respect to the Federal responsibility for the general welfare, to facilitate commerce, to encourage productive harmony between man and his environment, and to protect the public interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) the Federal Government should encourage and assist private industry through Federal assistance for the development and demonstration of practicable means to produce useful energy from geothermal resources with environmentally acceptable processes.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional declaration of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the Congress to encourage and assist in the commercial development of practicable means to produce useful energy from geothermal resources with environmentally acceptable processes. Accordingly, it is the policy of the Congress to facilitate such commercial development by authorizing the Chairman of the Project to designate an appropriate Federal agency to guarantee loans for such purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authorization of heads of designated agencies to guarantee loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to encourage the commercial production of energy from geothermal resources, the head of the designated agency is authorized to, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, guarantee, and to enter into commitments to guarantee, lenders against loss of principal or interest on loans made by such lenders to qualified borrowers for the purposes of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the determination and evaluation of the resource base;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) research and development with respect to extraction and utilization technologies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) acquiring rights in geothermal resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) development, construction, and operation of facilities for the demonstration or commercial production of energy using geothermal resources; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) construction and operation of a new commercial, agricultural, or industrial structure or facility or modification and operation of an existing commercial, agricultural, or industrial structure or facility, when geothermal hot water or steam is to be used within or by such structure or facility, or modification thereto, for the purposes of space heating or cooling, industrial or agricultural processes, onsite generation of electricity for use other than for sale or resale in commerce, other commercial applications, or combinations of applications separately eligible under this subchapter for loan guarantee assistance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Extent of guarantee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any guaranty under this subchapter shall apply only to so much of the principal amount of any loan as does not exceed 75 percent of the aggregate cost of the project with respect to which the loan is made, except that any guarantee made for a loan to an electric, housing, or other cooperative, or to a municipality (as defined in section 796(7) of title 16), may apply to so much of the principal amount of the loan as does not exceed 90 percent of the aggregate cost of the project. In determining the aggregate cost of a project for purposes of the preceding sentence, there shall be excluded the cost of constructing electrical transmission lines to the extent that the cost of constructing such lines exceeds 25 percent of the aggregate cost of the project (as determined without regard to this sentence); except that the Secretary may waive or limit the application of this sentence with respect to any project located in the State of Hawaii upon a finding that such project is remote from the area of primary consumption, that a transmission line is required before the geothermal reservoir can be developed, and that the particular transmission line involved will be used for more than the plant which is the subject of the loan guarantee. In the case of a guaranty for the purposes specified in subsection (b)(5) of this section, the aggregate cost of the project shall be deemed to be that portion of the total cost of construction and operation which is directly related to the utilization of geothermal energy within the structure or facility in question, except that the aggregate cost of the project with respect to which the loan is made may be the total cost including construction and operation in cases where the facility or structure has been located near a geothermal energy resource predominantly for the purpose of utilizing geothermal energy, or as determined by the Secretary of Energy the economic viability of the project is substantially dependent upon the performance of the geothermal reservoir.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Terms and conditions of guaranties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Loan guaranties under this subchapter shall be on such terms and conditions as the head of the designated agency determines, except that a guaranty shall be made under this subchapter only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the loan bears interest at a rate not to exceed such annual per centum on the principal obligation outstanding as the head of the designated agency determines to be reasonable, taking into account the range of interest rates prevailing in the private sector for similar loans and risks by the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the terms of such loan require full repayment over a period not to exceed thirty years, or the useful life of any physical asset to be financed by such loan, whichever is less (as determined by the head of the designated agency);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the judgment of the head of the designated agency, the amount of the loan (when combined with amounts available to the qualified borrower from other sources) will be sufficient to carry out the project; and</p>
