<p class="statutory-body">(a) From time to time the Postal Service shall request the Postal Rate Commission to submit a recommended decision on changes in a rate or rates of postage or in a fee or fees for postal services if the Postal Service determines that such changes would be in the public interest and in accordance with the policies of this title. The Postal Service may submit such suggestions for rate adjustments as it deems suitable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Upon receiving a request, the Commission shall make a recommended decision on the request for changes in rates or fees in each class of mail or type of service in accordance with the policies of this title and the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the establishment and maintenance of a fair and equitable schedule;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the value of the mail service actually provided each class or type of mail service to both the sender and the recipient, including but not limited to the collection, mode of transportation, and priority of delivery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the requirement that each class of mail or type of mail service bear the direct and indirect postal costs attributable to that class or type plus that portion of all other costs of the Postal Service reasonably assignable to such class or type;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the effect of rate increases upon the general public, business mail users, and enterprises in the private sector of the economy engaged in the delivery of mail matter other than letters;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the available alternative means of sending and receiving letters and other mail matter at reasonable costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) simplicity of structure for the entire schedule and simple, identifiable relationships between the rates or fees charged the various classes of mail for postal services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the educational, cultural, scientific, and informational value to the recipient of mail matter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) such other factors as the Commission deems appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Regular rates for each class or subclass of mail that includes 1 or more special rate categories for mail under former section 4358 (d) or (e), 4452 (b) or (c), or 4554 (b) or (c) of this title shall be established by applying the policies of this title, including the factors of section 3622(b) of this title, to the costs attributable to the regular rate mail in each class or subclass combined with the mail in the corresponding special rate categories authorized by former section 4358 (d) or (e), 4452 (b) or (c), or 4554 (b) or (c) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Compliance with any provision of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) shall not be considered by the Commission in determining whether to increase rates and shall not otherwise affect the service of the Postal Service.</p>
