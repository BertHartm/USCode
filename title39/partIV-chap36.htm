<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3622. Modern rate regulation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Authority Generally</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Postal Regulatory Commission shall, within 18 months after the date of enactment of this section, by regulation establish (and may from time to time thereafter by regulation revise) a modern system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Objectives</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Such system shall be designed to achieve the following objectives, each of which shall be applied in conjunction with the others:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To maximize incentives to reduce costs and increase efficiency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To create predictability and stability in rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To maintain high quality service standards established under section 3691.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To allow the Postal Service pricing flexibility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To assure adequate revenues, including retained earnings, to maintain financial stability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) To reduce the administrative burden and increase the transparency of the ratemaking process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) To enhance mail security and deter terrorism.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) To establish and maintain a just and reasonable schedule for rates and classifications, however the objective under this paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit the Postal Service from making changes of unequal magnitude within, between, or among classes of mail.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) To allocate the total institutional costs of the Postal Service appropriately between market-dominant and competitive products.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Factors</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In establishing or revising such system, the Postal Regulatory Commission shall take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the value of the mail service actually provided each class or type of mail service to both the sender and the recipient, including but not limited to the collection, mode of transportation, and priority of delivery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the requirement that each class of mail or type of mail service bear the direct and indirect postal costs attributable to each class or type of mail service through reliably identified causal relationships plus that portion of all other costs of the Postal Service reasonably assignable to such class or type;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the effect of rate increases upon the general public, business mail users, and enterprises in the private sector of the economy engaged in the delivery of mail matter other than letters;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the available alternative means of sending and receiving letters and other mail matter at reasonable costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) simplicity of structure for the entire schedule and simple, identifiable relationships between the rates or fees charged the various classes of mail for postal services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the importance of pricing flexibility to encourage increased mail volume and operational efficiency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the relative value to the people of the kinds of mail matter entered into the postal system and the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the importance of providing classifications with extremely high degrees of reliability and speed of delivery and of providing those that do not require high degrees of reliability and speed of delivery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the desirability of special classifications for both postal users and the Postal Service in accordance with the policies of this title, including agreements between the Postal Service and postal users, when available on public and reasonable terms to similarly situated mailers, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) improve the net financial position of the Postal Service through reducing Postal Service costs or increasing the overall contribution to the institutional costs of the Postal Service; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) enhance the performance of mail preparation, processing, transportation, or other functions; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) do not cause unreasonable harm to the marketplace.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) the educational, cultural, scientific, and informational value to the recipient of mail matter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) the need for the Postal Service to increase its efficiency and reduce its costs, including infrastructure costs, to help maintain high quality, affordable postal services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) the value to the Postal Service and postal users of promoting intelligent mail and of secure, sender-identified mail; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) the policies of this title as well as such other factors as the Commission determines appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:91 --><p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Requirements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) include an annual limitation on the percentage changes in rates to be set by the Postal Regulatory Commission that will be equal to the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers unadjusted for seasonal variation over the most recent available 12-month period preceding the date the Postal Service files notice of its intention to increase rates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establish a schedule whereby rates, when necessary and appropriate, would change at regular intervals by predictable amounts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) not later than 45 days before the implementation of any adjustment in rates under this section, including adjustments made under subsection (c)(10)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) require the Postal Service to provide public notice of the adjustment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provide an opportunity for review by the Postal Regulatory Commission;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) provide for the Postal Regulatory Commission to notify the Postal Service of any noncompliance of the adjustment with the limitation under subparagraph (A); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) require the Postal Service to respond to the notice provided under clause (iii) and describe the actions to be taken to comply with the limitation under subparagraph (A);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) establish procedures whereby the Postal Service may adjust rates not in excess of the annual limitations under subparagraph (A); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) notwithstanding any limitation set under subparagraphs (A) and (C), and provided there is not sufficient unused rate authority under paragraph (2)(C), establish procedures whereby rates may be adjusted on an expedited basis due to either extraordinary or exceptional circumstances, provided that the Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for a public hearing and comment, and within 90 days after any request by the Postal Service, that such adjustment is reasonable and equitable and necessary to enable the Postal Service, under best practices of honest, efficient, and economical management, to maintain and continue the development of postal services of the kind and quality adapted to the needs of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Limitations.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Classes of mail</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided under subparagraph (C), the annual limitations under paragraph (1)(A) shall apply to a class of mail, as defined in the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule as in effect on the date of enactment of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Rounding of rates and fees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Postal Service from rounding rates and fees to the nearest whole integer, if the effect of such rounding does not cause the overall rate increase for any class to exceed the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Use of unused rate authority.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;unused rate adjustment authority&rdquo; means the difference between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the maximum amount of a rate adjustment that the Postal Service is authorized to make in any year subject to the annual limitation under paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the amount of the rate adjustment the Postal Service actually makes in that year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to clause (iii), the Postal Service may use any unused rate adjustment authority for any of the 5 years following the year such authority occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In exercising the authority under clause (ii) in any year, the Postal Service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) may use unused rate adjustment authority from more than 1 year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) may use any part of the unused rate adjustment authority from any year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) shall use the unused rate adjustment authority from the earliest year such authority first occurred and then each following year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) for any class or service, may not exceed the annual limitation under paragraph (1) by more than 2 percentage points.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Workshare Discounts.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this subsection, the term &ldquo;workshare discount&rdquo; refers to rate discounts provided to mailers for the presorting, prebarcoding, handling, or transportation of mail, as further defined by the Postal Regulatory Commission under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Scope</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Postal Regulatory Commission shall ensure that such discounts do not exceed the cost that the Postal Service avoids as a result of workshare activity, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the discount is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) associated with a new postal service, a change to an existing postal service, or with a new work share initiative related to an existing postal service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) necessary to induce mailer behavior that furthers the economically efficient operation of the Postal Service and the <!-- PDFPage:92 -->portion of the discount in excess of the cost that the Postal Service avoids as a result of the workshare activity will be phased out over a limited period of time;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of the discount above costs avoided&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is necessary to mitigate rate shock; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) will be phased out over time;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the discount is provided in connection with subclasses of mail consisting exclusively of mail matter of educational, cultural, scientific, or informational value; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) reduction or elimination of the discount would impede the efficient operation of the Postal Service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Limitation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this subsection shall require that a work share discount be reduced or eliminated if the reduction or elimination of the discount would&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) lead to a loss of volume in the affected category or subclass of mail and reduce the aggregate contribution to the institutional costs of the Postal Service from the category or subclass subject to the discount below what it otherwise would have been if the discount had not been reduced or eliminated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) result in a further increase in the rates paid by mailers not able to take advantage of the discount.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever the Postal Service establishes a workshare discount rate, the Postal Service shall, at the time it publishes the workshare discount rate, submit to the Postal Regulatory Commission a detailed report that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) explains the Postal Service's reasons for establishing the rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) sets forth the data, economic analyses, and other information relied on by the Postal Service to justify the rate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) certifies that the discount will not adversely affect rates or services provided to users of postal services who do not take advantage of the discount rate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Transition Rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For the 1-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this section, rates and classes for market-dominant products shall remain subject to modification in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and section 407, as such provisions were last in effect before the date of enactment of this section. Proceedings initiated to consider a request for a recommended decision filed by the Postal Service during that 1-year period shall be completed in accordance with subchapter II of chapter 36 of this title and implementing regulations, as in effect before the date of enactment of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Provisions waived</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A product shall not, while it is being tested under this section, be subject to the requirements of sections 3622, 3633, or 3642, or regulations promulgated under those sections.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Conditions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A product may not be tested under this section unless it satisfies each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Significantly different product</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The product is, from the viewpoint of the mail users, significantly different from all products offered by the Postal Service within the 2-year period preceding the start of the test.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Market disruption</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The introduction or continued offering of the product will not create an unfair or otherwise inappropriate competitive advantage for the Postal Service or any mailer, particularly in regard to small business concerns (as defined under subsection (h)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Correct categorization</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Postal Service identifies the product, for the purpose of a test under this section, as either market-dominant or competitive, consistent with the criteria under section 3642(b)(1). Costs and revenues attributable to a product identified as competitive shall be included in any determination under section 3633(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3641_1_target" name="3641_1">1</a></sup> (relating to provisions applicable to competitive products collectively). Any test that solely affects products currently classified as competitive, or which provides services ancillary to only competitive products, shall be presumed to be in the competitive product category without regard to whether a similar ancillary product exists for market-dominant products.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Notice.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At least 30 days before initiating a market test under this section, the Postal Service shall file with the Postal Regulatory Commission and publish in the Federal Register a notice&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) setting out the basis for the Postal Service's determination that the market test is covered by this section; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Safeguards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For a competitive experimental product, the provisions of section 504(g) shall be available with respect to any information required to be filed under paragraph (1) to the same extent and in the same manner as in the case of any matter described in section 504(g)(1). Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be considered to permit or require the publication of any information as to which confidential treatment is accorded under the preceding sentence (subject to the same exception as set forth in section 504(g)(3)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Duration.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A market test of a product under this section may be conducted over a period of not to exceed 24 months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Extension authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If necessary in order to determine the feasibility or desirability of a product being tested under this section, the Postal Regulatory Commission may, upon written application of the Postal Service (filed not later than 60 days before the date as of which the testing of such product would otherwise be scheduled to terminate under paragraph (1)), extend the testing of such product for not to exceed an additional 12 months.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Dollar-Amount Limitation.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A product may only be tested under this section if the total revenues that are anticipated, or in fact received, by the Postal Service from such product do not exceed $10,000,000 in any year, subject to paragraph (2) and subsection (g). In carrying out the preceding sentence, the Postal Regulatory Commission may limit the amount of revenues the Postal Service may obtain from any particular geographic market as necessary to prevent market disruption (as defined under subsection (b)(2)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Exemption authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Postal Regulatory Commission may, upon written applica<!-- PDFPage:100 -->tion of the Postal Service, exempt the market test from the limit in paragraph (1) if the total revenues that are anticipated, or in fact received, by the Postal Service from such product do not exceed $50,000,000 in any year, subject to subsection (g). In reviewing an application under this paragraph, the Postal Regulatory Commission shall approve such application if it determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the product is likely to benefit the public and meet an expected demand;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the product is likely to contribute to the financial stability of the Postal Service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the product is not likely to result in unfair or otherwise inappropriate competition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Cancellation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Postal Regulatory Commission at any time determines that a market test under this section fails, with respect to any particular product, to meet 1 or more of the requirements of this section, it may order the cancellation of the test involved or take such other action as it considers appropriate. A determination under this subsection shall be made in accordance with such procedures as the Commission shall by regulation prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Adjustment for Inflation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of each year following the year in which occurs the deadline for the Postal Service's first report to the Postal Regulatory Commission under section 3652(a), each dollar amount contained in this section shall be adjusted by the change in the Consumer Price Index for such year (as determined under regulations of the Commission).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Definition of a Small Business Concern</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The criteria used in defining small business concerns or otherwise categorizing business concerns as small business concerns shall, for purposes of this section, be established by the Postal Regulatory Commission in conformance with the requirements of section 3 of the Small Business Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Effective Date</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Market tests under this subchapter may be conducted in any year beginning with the first year in which occurs the deadline for the Postal Service's first report to the Postal Regulatory Commission under section 3652(a).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3642. New products and transfers of products between the market-dominant and competitive categories of mail</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon request of the Postal Service or users of the mails, or upon its own initiative, the Postal Regulatory Commission may change the list of market-dominant products under section 3621 and the list of competitive products under section 3631 by adding new products to the lists, removing products from the lists, or transferring products between the lists.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Criteria</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;All determinations by the Postal Regulatory Commission under subsection (a) shall be made in accordance with the following criteria:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The market-dominant category of products shall consist of each product in the sale of which the Postal Service exercises sufficient market power that it can effectively set the price of such product substantially above costs, raise prices significantly, decrease quality, or decrease output, without risk of losing a significant level of business to other firms offering similar products. The competitive category of products shall consist of all other products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Exclusion of products covered by postal monopoly</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A product covered by the postal monopoly shall not be subject to transfer under this section from the market-dominant category of mail. For purposes of the preced<!-- PDFPage:101 -->ing sentence, the term &ldquo;product covered by the postal monopoly&rdquo; means any product the conveyance or transmission of which is reserved to the United States under section 1696 of title 18, subject to the same exception as set forth in the last sentence of section 409(e)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Additional considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In making any decision under this section, due regard shall be given to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the availability and nature of enterprises in the private sector engaged in the delivery of the product involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the views of those who use the product involved on the appropriateness of the proposed action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the likely impact of the proposed action on small business concerns (within the meaning of section 3641(h)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Transfers of Subclasses and Other Subordinate Units Allowable</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this title shall be considered to prevent transfers under this section from being made by reason of the fact that they would involve only some (but not all) of the subclasses or other subordinate units of the class of mail or type of postal service involved (without regard to satisfaction of minimum quantity requirements standing alone).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Notification and Publication Requirements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Notification requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Postal Service shall, whenever it requests to add a product or transfer a product to a different category, file with the Postal Regulatory Commission and publish in the Federal Register a notice setting out the basis for its determination that the product satisfies the criteria under subsection (b) and, in the case of a request to add a product or transfer a product to the competitive category of mail, that the product meets the regulations promulgated by the Postal Regulatory Commission under section 3633. The provisions of section 504(g) shall be available with respect to any information required to be filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Publication requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Postal Regulatory Commission shall, whenever it changes the list of products in the market-dominant or competitive category of mail, prescribe new lists of products. The revised lists shall indicate how and when any previous lists (including the lists under sections 3621 and 3631) are superseded, and shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in section 3641, no product that involves the physical delivery of letters, printed matter, or packages may be offered by the Postal Service unless it has been assigned to the market-dominant or competitive category of mail (as appropriate) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) under this subchapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by or under any other provision of law.</p>
