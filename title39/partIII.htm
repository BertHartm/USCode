<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If the Postal Service determines that the moneys of the Fund are in excess of current needs, it may request the investment of such amounts as it deems advisable by the Secretary of the Treasury in obligations of, or obligations guaranteed by, the Government of the United States, and, with the approval of the Secretary, in such other obligations or securities as it deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) With the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Postal Service may deposit moneys of the Fund in any Federal Reserve bank, any depository for public funds, or in such other places and in such manner as the Postal Service and the Secretary may mutually agree.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any amounts appropriated to the Postal Service under subsection (d) of section 2401 of this title and deposited into the Fund shall be expended by the Postal Service only for the purposes provided in such subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Notwithstanding any provision of section 8147 of title 5, whenever the Secretary of Labor furnishes a statement to the Postal Service indicating an amount due from the Postal Service under subsection (b) of that section, the Postal Service shall make the deposit required pursuant to that statement (and any additional payment under subsection (c) of that section, to the extent that it relates to the period covered by such statement) not later than 30 days after the date on which such statement is so furnished. Any deposit (and any additional payment) which is subject to the preceding sentence shall, once made, remain available without fiscal year limitation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for each of the fiscal years 1972 through 1979, an amount equal to 10 percent of the sum appropriated to the former Post Office Department by Act of Congress for its use in fiscal year 1971;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for fiscal year 1980, an amount equal to 9 percent of such sum for fiscal year 1971;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After fiscal year 1984, the Postal Service may reduce the percentage figure in paragraph (1)(G) of this subsection, including a reduction to 0, if the Postal Service finds that the amounts determined under such paragraph are no longer required to operate the Postal Service in accordance with the policies of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Postal Service each year a sum determined by the Postal Service to be equal to the difference between the revenues the Postal Service would have received if sections 3217 and 3403 through 3406 had not been enacted and the estimated revenues to be received on mail carried under such sections. In requesting an appropriation under this subsection for a fiscal year, the Postal Service shall include an amount to reconcile sums authorized to be appropriated for prior fiscal years on the basis of estimated mail volume.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) As reimbursement to the Postal Service for losses which it incurred as a result of insufficient amounts appropriated under section 2401(c) for fiscal years 1991 through 1993, and to compensate for the additional revenues it is estimated the Postal Service would have received under the provisions of section 3626(a), for the period beginning on October 1, 1993, and ending on September 30, 1998, if the fraction specified in subclause (VI) of section 3626(a)(3)(B)(ii) were applied with respect to such period (instead of the respective fractions specified in subclauses (I) through (V) thereof), there are authorized to be appropriated to the Postal Service $29,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1994 through 2035.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Postal Service shall present to the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service of the House of Representatives and the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives, at the same time it submits its annual budget under section 2009 of this title, sufficient copies of the budget of the Postal Service for the fiscal year for which funds are requested to be appropriated, and a comprehensive statement relating to the following matters:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the plans, policies, and procedures of the Postal Service designed to comply with all of the provisions of section 101 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) postal operations generally, including data on the speed and reliability of service provided for the various classes of mail and <!-- PDFPage:36 -->types of mail service, mail volume, productivity, trends in postal operations, and analyses of the impact of internal and external factors upon the Postal Service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a listing of the total expenditures and obligations incurred by the Postal Service for the most recent fiscal year for which information is available, an estimate of the total expenditures and obligations to be incurred by the Postal Service during the fiscal year for which funds are requested to be appropriated, and the means by which these estimated expenses will be financed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) such other matters as the committees may determine necessary to ensure that the Congress is fully and currently consulted and informed on postal operations, plans, and policies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Not later than March 15 of each year, the Postal Service shall appear before the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service of the House of Representatives to submit information which any such committee considers necessary to determine the amount of funds to be appropriated for the operation of the Postal Service, and to present testimony and respond to questions with respect to such budget and statement. Each such committee shall take such action as it considers appropriate and shall advise the Postal Service of such action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The failure of the President to request the appropriation of any part of the funds authorized by this section may not be deemed a failure of appropriations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The rates established under chapter 36 of this title for zone-rated parcels formerly entered under former chapter 67 of this title shall not be more than 10 percent less than the rates for such mail would be if the funds authorized under subsection (b) were not appropriated.</p>
