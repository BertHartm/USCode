In any one fiscal year, the net increase in the amount of obligations outstanding issued for the purpose of capital improvements and the net increase in the amount of obligations outstanding issued for the purpose of defraying operating expenses of the Postal Service shall not exceed a combined total of $3,000,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The maximum amount allowable under this paragraph is&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Postal Service may pledge the assets of the Postal Service and pledge and use its revenues and receipts for the payment of the principal of or interest on obligations issued by the Postal Service under this section, for the purchase or redemption thereof, and for other purposes incidental thereto, including creation of reserve, sinking, and other funds which may be similarly pledged and used, to such extent and in such manner as it deems necessary or desirable.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the authority to pledge assets of the Postal Service under this subsection shall be available only to the extent that such assets are not related to the provision of competitive products (as determined under section 2011(h) or, for purposes of any period before accounting practices and principles under section 2011(h) have been established and applied, the best information available from the Postal Service, including the audited statements required by section 2008(e)); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any authority under this subsection relating to the pledging or other use of revenues or receipts of the Postal Service shall be available only to the extent that they are not revenues or receipts of the Competitive Products Fund.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Obligations issued by the Postal Service under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall be in such forms and denominations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall be sold at such times and in such amounts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall mature at such time or times;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) shall be sold at such prices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) shall bear such rates of interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) may be redeemable before maturity in such manner, at such times, and at such redemption premiums;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) may be entitled to such relative priorities of claim on the assets of the Postal Service with respect to principal and interest payments; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) shall be subject to such other terms and conditions;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) contain a recital that they are issued under this section, and such recital shall be conclusive evidence of the regularity of the issuance and sale of such obligations and of their validity;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) be exempt both as to principal and interest from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by any State or local taxing authority except estate, inheritance, and gift taxes; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the plans, policies, and procedures of the Postal Service designed to comply with all of the provisions of section 101 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) postal operations generally, including data on the speed and reliability of service provided for the various classes of mail and <!-- PDFPage:53 -->types of mail service, mail volume, productivity, trends in postal operations, and analyses of the impact of internal and external factors upon the Postal Service;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) such other matters as the committees may determine necessary to ensure that the Congress is fully and currently consulted and informed on postal operations, plans, and policies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Each year, the Postal Service shall appear before the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Government Reform of the House of Representatives to submit information which any such committee considers necessary to determine the amount of funds to be appropriated for the operation of the Postal Service, and to present testimony and respond to questions with respect to such budget and statement. Each such committee shall take such action as it considers appropriate and shall advise the Postal Service of such action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The failure of the President to request the appropriation of any part of the funds authorized by this section may not be deemed a failure of appropriations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The rates established under chapter 36 of this title for zone-rated parcels formerly entered under former chapter 67 of this title shall not be more than 10 percent less than the rates for such mail would be if the funds authorized under subsection (b) were not appropriated.</p>
