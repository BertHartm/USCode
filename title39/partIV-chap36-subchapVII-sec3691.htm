<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Authority Generally</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of this section, the Postal Service shall, in consultation with the Postal Regulatory Commission, by regulation establish (and may from time to time thereafter by regulation revise) a set of service standards for market-dominant products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Objectives.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Such standards shall be designed to achieve the following objectives:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) To enhance the value of postal services to both senders and recipients.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) To preserve regular and effective access to postal services in all communities, including those in rural areas or where post offices are not self-sustaining.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) To reasonably assure Postal Service customers delivery reliability, speed and frequency consistent with reasonable rates and best business practices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) To provide a system of objective external performance measurements for each market-dominant product as a basis for measurement of Postal Service performance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Implementation of performance measurements.&mdash;With respect to paragraph (1)(D), with the approval of the Postal Regulatory Commission an internal measurement system may be implemented instead of an external measurement system.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:109 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Factors</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In establishing or revising such standards, the Postal Service shall take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the actual level of service that Postal Service customers receive under any service guidelines previously established by the Postal Service or service standards established under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the degree of customer satisfaction with Postal Service performance in the acceptance, processing and delivery of mail;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the needs of Postal Service customers, including those with physical impairments;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) mail volume and revenues projected for future years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the projected growth in the number of addresses the Postal Service will be required to serve in future years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the current and projected future cost of serving Postal Service customers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the effect of changes in technology, demographics, and population distribution on the efficient and reliable operation of the postal delivery system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the policies of this title and such other factors as the Postal Service determines appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The regulations promulgated pursuant to this section (and any revisions thereto), and any violations thereof, shall be subject to review upon complaint under sections 3662 and 3663.</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) as noted by the President's Commission on the United States Postal Service, the Postal Service has more facilities than it needs and the streamlining of this distribution network can pave the way for the potential consolidation of sorting facilities and the elimination of excess costs;</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) a discussion of what impact any facility changes may have on the postal workforce and whether the Postal Service has sufficient flexibility to make needed workforce changes;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) an identification of anticipated costs, cost savings, and other benefits associated with the infrastructure rationalization alternatives discussed in the plan; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) procedures that the Postal Service will use to&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(ii) an account of actions taken to identify any excess capacity within its processing, transportation, and distribution networks and implement savings through realignment or consolidation of facilities including overall estimated costs and cost savings;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(iii) an estimate of how postal decisions related to mail changes, security, automation initiatives, worksharing, information technology systems, excess capacity, consolidating and closing facilities, and other areas will impact rationalization plans;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(iv) identification of any statutory or regulatory obstacles that prevented or will prevent or hinder the Postal Service from taking action to realign or consolidate facilities; and</p>
