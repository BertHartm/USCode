In requesting an appropriation under this subsection for a fiscal year, the Postal Service shall include an amount to reconcile sums authorized to be appropriated for prior fiscal years on the basis of estimated mail volume.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) As reimbursement to the Postal Service for losses which it incurred as a result of insufficient amounts appropriated under section 2401(c) for fiscal years 1991 through 1993, and to compensate for the additional revenues it is estimated the Postal Service would have received under the provisions of section 3626(a), for the period beginning on October 1, 1993, and ending on September 30, 1998, if the fraction specified in subclause (VI) of section 3626(a)(3)(B)(ii) were applied with respect to such period (instead of the respective fractions specified in subclauses (I) through (V) thereof), there are authorized to be appropriated to the Postal Service $29,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1994 through 2035.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the plans, policies, and procedures of the Postal Service designed to comply with all of the provisions of section 101 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) postal operations generally, including data on the speed and reliability of service provided for the various classes of mail and types of mail service, mail volume, productivity, trends in postal operations, and analyses of the impact of internal and external factors upon the Postal Service;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) such other matters as the committees may determine necessary to ensure that the Congress is fully and currently consulted and informed on postal operations, plans, and policies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Not later than March 15 of each year, the Postal Service shall appear before the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service of <!-- PDFPage:40 -->the House of Representatives to submit information which any such committee considers necessary to determine the amount of funds to be appropriated for the operation of the Postal Service, and to present testimony and respond to questions with respect to such budget and statement. Each such committee shall take such action as it considers appropriate and shall advise the Postal Service of such action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The failure of the President to request the appropriation of any part of the funds authorized by this section may not be deemed a failure of appropriations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The rates established under chapter 36 of this title for zone-rated parcels formerly entered under former chapter 67 of this title shall not be more than 10 percent less than the rates for such mail would be if the funds authorized under subsection (b) were not appropriated.</p>
