<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Postal Service shall prepare an annual performance plan covering each program activity set forth in the Postal Service budget, which shall be included in the comprehensive statement presented under section 2401(e) of this title. Such plan shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) establish performance goals to define the level of performance to be achieved by a program activity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) express such goals in an objective, quantifiable, and measurable form unless an alternative form is used under subsection (b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) briefly describe the operational processes, skills and technology, and the human, capital, information, or other resources required to meet the performance goals;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) include separate descriptive statements of&mdash;</p>
