<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Postal Service may contract for the transportation of mail by aircraft between any of the points in foreign air transportation only with certificated air carriers. A contract may be awarded to a certificated air carrier to transport mail by air between any of the points in foreign air transportation that the Secretary of Transportation has authorized the carrier to serve either directly or through a code-share relationship with one or more foreign air carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) If the Postal Service has sought offers or proposals from certificated air carriers to transport mail in foreign air transportation between points, or pairs of points within a geographic region or regions, and has not received offers or proposals that meet Postal Service requirements at a fair and reasonable price from at least 2 such carriers, the Postal Service may seek offers or proposals from foreign air carriers. Where service in foreign air transportation meeting the Postal Service's requirements is unavailable at a fair and reasonable price from at least 2 certificated air carriers, either directly or through a code-share relationship with one or more foreign air carriers, the Postal Service may contract with foreign air carriers to provide the service sought if, when the Postal Service seeks offers or proposals from foreign air carriers, it also seeks an offer or proposal to provide that service from any certificated air carrier providing service between those points, or pairs of points within a geographic region or regions, on the same terms and conditions that are being sought from foreign air carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) For purposes of this subsection, the Postal Service shall use a methodology for determining fair and reasonable prices for the Postal Service designated region or regions developed in consultation with, and with the concurrence of, certificated air carriers representing at least 51 percent of available ton miles in the markets of interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) For purposes of this subsection, ceiling prices determined pursuant to the methodology used under subparagraph (C) shall be presumed to be fair and reasonable if they do not exceed the ceiling prices derived from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a weighted average based on market rate data furnished by the International Air Transport Association or a subsidiary unit thereof; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if such data are not available from those sources, such other neutral, regularly updated set of weighted average market rates as the Postal Service, with the concurrence of certificated air carriers representing at least 51 percent of available ton miles in the markets of interest, may designate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) If, for purposes of subparagraph (D)(ii), concurrence cannot be attained, then the most recently available market rate data described in this subparagraph shall continue to apply for the relevant market or markets.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Contract process</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Postal Service shall contract for foreign air transportation as set forth in paragraph (1) through an open procurement process that will provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) potential offerors with timely notice of business opportunities in sufficient detail to allow them to make a proposal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) requirements, proposed terms and conditions, and evaluation criteria to potential offerors; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:114 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) an opportunity for unsuccessful offerors to receive prompt feedback upon request.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Emergency or unanticipated conditions; inadequate lift space</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Postal Service may enter into contracts to transport mail by air in foreign air transportation with a certificated air carrier or a foreign air carrier without complying with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) emergency or unanticipated conditions exist that make it impractical for the Postal Service to comply with such requirements; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) its demand for lift exceeds the space available to it under existing contracts and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) there is insufficient time available to seek additional lift using procedures that comply with those requirements without compromising the Postal Service's service commitments to its own customers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Postal Service first offers any certificated air carrier holding a contract to carry mail between the relevant points the opportunity to carry such excess volumes under the terms of its existing contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Good Faith Effort Required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Postal Service and potential offerors shall put a good-faith effort into resolving disputes concerning the award of contracts made under subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If the Postal Service determines that service by certificated air carriers or combination of air carriers between any pair or pairs of points in foreign air transportation is not adequate for its purposes, it may contract, without advertising for bids, in such manner and under such terms and conditions as it may deem appropriate, with any air taxi operator or combination thereof for such air transportation service. Contracts made under this subsection may be renewed at the existing rate by mutual agreement between the holder and the Postal Service. The Postal Service, with the consent of the air taxi operator, may adjust the compensation under such contracts for increased or decreased costs occasioned by changed conditions occurring during the contract term. The Postal Service shall cancel such a contract when the Secretary authorizes an additional certificated carrier or carriers to provide service between any pair or pairs of points covered by the contract, and such carrier or carriers inaugurate schedules adequate for its purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) The Postal Service may determine rates and contract with any air carrier for the transportation of mail by aircraft in interstate air transportation either through negotiations or competitive bidding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the exercise of its authority under paragraph (1), the Postal Service may require any air carrier to accept as mail shipments of day-old poultry, honeybees, and such other live animals as postal regulations allow to be transmitted as mail matter. The authority of the Postal Service under this subparagraph shall not apply in the case of any air carrier who commonly and regularly refuses to accept any live animals as cargo.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Postal Service is authorized to assess, as postage to be paid by the mailers of any shipments covered by subparagraph (A), a reasonable surcharge that the Postal Service determines in its discretion to be adequate to compensate air carriers for any necessary additional expense incurred in handling such shipments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The authority of the Secretary and the Postal Service under subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall also apply, and the authority of the Postal Service under subsection (e) shall not apply, to the transportation of mail by aircraft between any two points both of which are within the State of Alaska and between which the air carrier is authorized by the Secretary to engage in the transportation of mail.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1)(A) The Postal Service, in selecting carriers of nonpriority bypass mail to any point served by more than 1 carrier in the State of Alaska, shall adhere to an equitable tender policy within a qualified group of carriers, in accordance with the regulations of the Postal Service, and shall, at a minimum, require that any such carrier&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Postal Service, after consultation with affected carriers, may establish for service by aircraft described under subparagraph (A)(iv)(II)&mdash;</p>

<!-- PDFPage:115 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may provide direct mainline non-priority bypass mail service to any bush point in the State of Alaska, without regard to paragraph (1)(B), if such service is equal to or better than interline service in cost and quality;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall deduct the non-priority bypass mail poundage flown on direct mainline flights to bush points within the State of Alaska by any carrier, from such carrier's allocation of the total poundage of non-priority bypass mail transported to the nearest appropriate Postal Service hub point in any month;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall offer a bush passenger carrier providing service on a route in the State of Alaska between an acceptance point and a hub not served by a mainline carrier the opportunity to receive equitable tender of nonpriority bypass mail at mainline service rates when a mainline carrier begins serving that route if the bush passenger carrier&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) meets the requirements of paragraph (1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) provided at least 20 percent of the passenger service (as calculated in subsection (h)(5)) between such city pair for the 6 months immediately preceding the date on which the bush carrier seeks such tender; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) continues to provide not less than 20 percent of the passenger service on the city pair while seeking such tender;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) shall offer bush passenger carriers and nonmail freight carriers the opportunity to receive equitable tender of nonpriority bypass mail at mainline service rates from a hub point to a destination city in the State of Alaska if the city pair is also being served by a mainline carrier and&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the carrier provided at least 25 percent of the nonmail freight service (as calculated in subsection (i)(6)) on the city pair route for the 6 months immediately preceding the date on which the carrier seeks such tender;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E)(i) shall not offer equitable tender of nonpriority mainline bypass mail at mainline rates to a bush carrier operating from an acceptance point to a hub point in the State of Alaska, except as described in subparagraph (C); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) may tender nonpriority bypass mail at bush rates to a bush carrier from an acceptance point to a hub point in the State of Alaska if the Postal Service determines that&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) may offer tender of nonpriority bypass mail to a passenger carrier from an acceptance point to a destination city beyond a hub point in the State of Alaska at a composite rate if the Postal Service determines that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) In this section, the percent of passenger service shall be a percentage calculated using data collected under subsection (k).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the purposes of calculating passenger service as described under subparagraph (A), a bush passenger carrier providing intervillage bush passenger service may include the carriage of passengers carried along any point of the route between the route's origination point and the final destination point. Such calculation shall be based only on the carriage of passengers on regularly scheduled flights and only on flights being flown in a direction away from the hub point. Passenger service provided on chartered flights shall not be included in the carrier's calculation of passenger service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) The Secretary shall establish new bush rates for passenger carriers operating in the State of Alaska receiving tender of nonpriority bypass mail under this subsection.</p>

If no nonmail freight carrier is present on a city pair route in the State of Alaska to receive tender of nonpriority bypass mail under this paragraph, the nonpriority bypass mail to be divided under paragraph (1) shall be divided equitably among carriers qualified under subsection (h).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Qualification for the tender of mail under this subsection shall not be counted toward the minimum qualifications necessary to be tendered nonpriority bypass mail on any other route.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) The percentage rate in paragraph (1) shall be 25 percent beginning 3 years and 3 months after the date of enactment of the Rural Service Improvement Act of 2002.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of subparagraph (B), a carrier may designate only one hub city as its main hub and once such designation is transmitted to the Postal Service it may not be changed. Such selection and transmission must be transmitted to the Postal Service within 6 months of the date of enactment of the Rural Service Improvement Act of 2002. A carrier attempting to receive tender of nonpriority bypass mail under this subsection shall not be eligible for such tender after the carrier becomes qualified for tender of nonpriority bypass mail under subsection (h) or (i) on any route. The purchase of another carrier's hanger facility after such date of enactment shall not be considered sufficient to meet the requirement of subparagraph (B)(iv).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) At least once every 2 years, in conjunction with annual updates, the Secretary shall review the need for a bush mail rate investigation. The Secretary shall use show cause procedures to speedily and more accurately determine the cost of providing bush mail service. In determining such rates, the Secretary shall not take into account the cost of passenger insurance rates or premiums paid by the passenger carriers or other costs associated with passenger service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In order to ensure sufficient, reliable, and timely traffic data to meet the requirements of this subsection, the Secretary shall require&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the monthly submission of the bush carrier's data on T&ndash;100 diskettes, or any other suitable form of data collection, as determined by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the carriers to retain all books, records, and other source and summary documentation to support their reports and to preserve and maintain such documentation in a manner that readily permits the audit and examination by representatives of the Postal Service or the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Documentation under paragraph (2) shall be retained for 7 years or until the Secretary indicates that the records may be destroyed. Copies of flight logs for aircraft sold or disposed of shall be retained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Carriers qualified to be tendered nonpriority bypass mail shall submit to the Secretary the number and type of aircraft in the carrier's fleet, the level of passenger insurance covering its fleet, and the name of the insurance company providing such coverage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) No qualified carrier may be tendered nonpriority bypass mail under subsections (h) and (i) simultaneously on a route unless no other carrier is tendered mail under either subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(n)(1) A carrier operation resulting from a merger or acquisition between any 2 carriers operating between points in the State of Alaska shall have the passenger and nonmail freight of all such merged or acquired carriers on the applicable route counted toward meeting the resulting carrier's minimum requirements to receive equitable tender of nonpriority bypass mail on such route for the 12-month period following the date of the merger or acquisition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After the 12-month period described under paragraph (1), the carrier resulting from the merger or acquisition shall demonstrate that the carrier meets the minimum passenger or nonmail freight carriage requirements of this section to continue receiving tender of such mail.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>o</em>) In addition to any penalties applied to a carrier by the Federal Aviation Administration or the Secretary, any carrier that significantly misstates passenger or nonmail freight data required to be reported under this section on any route, in an attempt to qualify for tender of nonpriority bypass mail, shall receive&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a 1-month suspension of tender of nonpriority bypass mail on the route where the data was misstated for the first offense;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(p)(1) The Postal Service or the Secretary, in carrying out subsection (g)(2), (h), or (i), may deny equitable tender to an otherwise qualified carrier that does not operate under this section in good faith or under the intent of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Postal Service or the Secretary may waive any provision of subsection (h) or (i), if the carrier provides substantial passenger or nonmail freight service on the route in the State of Alaska where the carrier seeks tender of nonpriority mail and nonpriority bypass mail.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) To ensure adequate competition among passenger carriers on a mainline route in the State of Alaska the Postal Service or the Secretary may waive the requirements of subsection (g)(1)(A)(iv), (g)(2)(E), (g)(4), or (g)(5), or any provision of subsection (h) if a 121 bush passenger carrier seeks tender of nonpriority bypass mail on a mainline route in the State of Alaska not served by a 121 mainline passenger carrier and the 121 bush passenger carrier provides substantial passenger service on the route. Waivers provided for under this paragraph shall be granted only in extreme cases of lack of competition and only to extent that are absolutely necessary to meet the minimum needs of the community. Waivers granted under this subsection shall cease to be valid once a qualified mainline passenger carrier begins providing service and seeks tender of nonpriority bypass mail in accordance with this section on the city pair route. The receipt of waivers and subsequent operation of service on a city pair route under this subsection shall not be counted towards meeting the requirements of any part of this section for any other city pair route.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In granting waivers for or denying tender to carriers under this subsection, the Postal Service or the Secretary shall consider in the following order of importance&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the nonmail freight needs of the destination to be served;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the amount of nonpriority bypass mail service already available to the destination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the mail needs of the destination to be served;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the savings to the Postal Service in terms of payments made to carriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the amount or level of passenger service already available to the destination; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) the amount of nonmail freight service already available to the destination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(q) The Secretary shall make a regular review of carriers receiving, or attempting to qualify to receive, equitable tender of nonpriority bypass mail on a city pair route in the State of Alaska. If the Secretary suspends or revokes an operating certificate, the Secretary shall notify the Postal Service. Upon such notification, the Postal Service shall cease tender of mail to such carrier until the Secretary certifies the carrier is operating in a safe manner. Upon such receipt, the carrier shall demonstrate that it otherwise meets the minimum carriage requirements of this section before being tendered mail under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(r) The Postal Service shall have the authority to tender nonpriority bypass mail to any carrier that meets the requirements of subsection (g)(1) on any city pair route in the State of Alaska on an emergency basis. Such emergency tender shall cease when a carrier qualifies for tender on such route under the terms of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(s) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and except for written contracts authorized under subsections (b), (c) and (d), tender by the Postal Service of any category of mail to a carrier for transportation between any two points in the State of Alaska shall not give rise to any contract between the Postal Service and a carrier, nor shall any such carrier acquire any right in continued or future tender of such mail by virtue of past or present receipt of such mail. This subsection shall apply to any case commenced before, on, or after the date of enactment of this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;206, title III, &sect;3002(b), Aug. 2, 2002, 116 Stat. 910, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The State of Alaska is the largest State in the Union and has a very limited system of roads connecting communities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Alaska has more pilots per capita than any other State in the Union.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Pilots flying in Alaska are often the most skilled and best-prepared pilots in the world.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Air travel within the State of Alaska is often hampered by severe weather conditions and treacherous terrain.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The United States Government owns nearly 2/3 of Alaska's landmass, including large tracts of land separating isolated communities within the State.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Such Federal ownership has inhibited the ability of Alaskans to build roads connecting isolated communities.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:122 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Most communities and a large portion of the population within the State can only be reached by air.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The vast majority of food items and everyday necessities destined for these isolated communities and populations can only be transported through the air.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system, created by Congress and operated by the United States Postal Service under section 5402 of title 39, United States Code, with input from the Department of Transportation, connecting hundreds of rural and isolated communities within the State, is a critical piece of the Alaska and the national transportation system. The system is like a 4-legged stool, designed to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) provide the most affordable means of delivering food and everyday necessities to these rural and isolated communities;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) establish a system whereby the Postal Service can meet its obligations to deliver mail to every house and business in the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) support affordable and reliable passenger service; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) support affordable and reliable nonmail freight service.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Without the Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) it would be difficult and more expensive for the Postal Service to meet its obligation of delivering mail to every house and business in the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) food, medicine, freight, and everyday necessities and passenger service for these rural and isolated communities would cost several times the current level.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Attempts by Congress to support passenger and nonmail freight service in Alaska using the Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system have yielded some positive results, but some carriers have been manipulating the system by carrying few, if any, passengers and little nonmail freight while earning most of their revenues from the carriage of nonpriority bypass mail.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) As long as the Federal Government continues to own large tracts of land within the State of Alaska which impede access to isolated communities, it is in the best interest of the Postal Service, the residents of Alaska and the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) to ensure that the Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system remains strong, viable, and affordable for the Postal Service;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) to ensure that residents of rural and isolated communities in Alaska continue to have affordable, reliable, and safe passenger service;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) to ensure that residents of rural and isolated communities in Alaska continue to have affordable, reliable, and safe nonmail freight service;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) to encourage that intra-Alaska air carriers move toward safer, more secure, and more reliable air transportation under the Federal Aviation Administration's guidelines and in accordance with part 121 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, where such operations are supported by the needs of the community; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) that Congress, pursuant to the authority granted under Article I, section 8 of the United States Constitution to establish Post Offices and post roads, make changes to ensure that the Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system continues to be used to support substantial passenger and nonmail freight service and to reduce costs for the Postal Service.&rdquo;</p>
