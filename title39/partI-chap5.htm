<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Subparagraph (B) shall not be construed to authorize the Governors to adjust any item included within the budget.</p>

In determining the appropriate degree of confidentiality to be accorded information identified by the Postal Service under paragraph (1), the Commission shall balance the nature and extent of the likely commercial injury to the Postal Service against the public interest in maintaining the financial transparency of a government establishment competing in commercial markets.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Paragraph (2) shall not prevent the Commission from requiring production of information in the course of any discovery procedure established in connection with a proceeding under this title.
