<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) shall, to the extent that such savings are attributable to fiscal year 2003 or 2004, be used to reduce the postal debt (in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury), and the Postal Service shall not incur additional debt to offset the use of the savings to reduce the postal debt in fiscal years 2003 and 2004;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) shall, to the extent that such savings are attributable to fiscal year 2005, be used to continue holding postage rates unchanged and to reduce the postal debt, to such extent and in such manner as the Postal Service shall specify (in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury); and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to the extent that such savings are attributable to any fiscal year after fiscal year 2005, shall be considered to be operating expenses of the Postal Service and, until otherwise provided for by law, shall be held in escrow and may not be obligated or expended.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Amounts Saved.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The amounts representing any savings accruing to the Postal Service in any fiscal year as a result of the enactment of this Act shall be computed by the Office of Personnel Management for each such fiscal year in accordance with paragraph (2).</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) submit such plan to the Committee on Government Reform of the House of Representatives <!-- PDFPage:35 -->and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) <cap-smallcap>Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The plan shall be formulated in consultation with the Postal Service and shall include the opportunity for the Postal Service to request reconsideration of computations under this subsection, and for the Board of Actuaries of the Civil Service Retirement System to review and make adjustments to such computations, to the same extent and in the same manner as provided under section 8423(c) of title 5, United States Code.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) because the Postal Service still faces substantial obligations related to postretirement health benefits for its current and former employees, some portion of the savings referred to in paragraph (1) should be used to address those unfunded obligations; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) none of the savings referred to in paragraph (1) should be used in the computation of any bonuses for Postal Service executives.</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the Office shall inform the Postmaster General of its determination, including the size of the surplus so determined; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) the Postmaster General shall submit to the Congress a report describing how the Postal Service proposes that such surplus be used, including a draft of any legislation that might be necessary.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Determination date</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The date to be used for purposes of paragraph (1) shall be September 30, 2025, or such earlier date as, in the judgment of the Office, is the date by which all postal employees under the Civil Service Retirement System will have retired.</p>
