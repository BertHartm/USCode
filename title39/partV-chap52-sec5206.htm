<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Board may make deductions from the compensation of a carrier for failure to perform mail transportation service as required under section 5203 of this title.

Such deductions shall not be made prior to the expiration of 60 days following service upon the carrier by the Board of notice of intention to assess a fine or make a deduction and of the basis therefor.</p>
