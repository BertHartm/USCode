<h3 class="section-head">&sect;360kk. Performance standards for electronic products</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Promulgation of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall by regulation prescribe performance standards for electronic products to control the emission of electronic product radiation from such products if he determines that such standards are necessary for the protection of the public health and safety. Such standards may include provisions for the testing of such products and the measurement of their electronic product radiation emissions, may require the attachment of warning signs and labels, and may require the provision of instructions for the installation, operation, and use of such products. Such standards may be prescribed from time to time whenever such determinations are made, but the first of such standards shall be prescribed prior to January 1, 1970. In the development of such standards, the Secretary shall consult with Federal and State departments and agencies having related responsibilities or interests and with appropriate professional organizations and interested persons, including representatives of industries and labor organizations which would be affected by such standards, and shall give consideration to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the latest available scientific and medical data in the field of electronic product radiation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the standards currently recommended by (i) other Federal agencies having responsibilities relating to the control and measurement of electronic product radiation, and (ii) public or private groups having an expertise in the field of electronic product radiation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the reasonableness and technical feasibility of such standards as applied to a particular electronic product;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the adaptability of such standards to the need for uniformity and reliability of testing and measuring procedures and equipment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) in the case of a component, or accessory described in paragraph (2)(B) of section 360hh of this title, the performance of such article in the manufactured or assembled product for which it is designed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may prescribe different and individual performance standards, to the extent appropriate and feasible, for different electronic products so as to recognize their different operating characteristics and uses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The performance standards prescribed under this section shall not apply to any electronic product which is intended solely for export if (A) such product and the outside of any shipping container used in the export of such product are labeled or tagged to show that such product is intended for export, and (B) such product meets all the applicable requirements of the country to which such product is intended for export.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may by regulation amend or revoke any performance standard prescribed under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary may exempt from the provisions of this section any electronic product intended for use by departments or agencies of the United States provided such department or agency has prescribed procurement specifications governing emissions of electronic product radiation and provided further that such product is of a type used solely or predominantly by departments or agencies of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Administrative procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5 (relating to the administrative procedure for rulemaking), and of chapter 7 of title 5 (relating to judicial review), shall apply with respect to any regulation prescribing, amending, or revoking any standard prescribed under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Publication in Federal Register</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each regulation prescribing, amending, or revoking a standard shall specify the date on which it shall take effect which, in the case of any regulation prescribing, or amending any standard, may not be sooner than one year or not later than two years after the date on which such regulation is issued, unless the Secretary finds, for good cause shown, that an earlier or later effective date is in the public interest and publishes in the Federal Register his reason for such finding, in which case such earlier or later date shall apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In a case of actual controversy as to the validity of any regulation issued under this section prescribing, amending, or revoking a performance standard, any person who will be adversely affected by such regulation when it is effective may at any time prior to the sixtieth day after such regulation is issued file a petition with the United States court of appeals for the circuit wherein such person resides or has his principal place of business, for a judicial review of such regulation. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary or other officer designated by him for that purpose. The Secretary thereupon shall file in the court the record of the proceedings on which the Secretary based the regulation, as provided in section 2112 of title 28.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the petitioner applies to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shows to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the proceeding before the Secretary, the court may order such additional evidence (and evidence in rebuttal thereof) to be taken before the Secretary, and to be adduced upon the hearing, in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The Secretary may modify his findings, or make new findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and he shall file such <!-- PDFPage:258 -->modified or new findings, and his recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of his original regulation, with the return of such additional evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon the filing of the petition referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the court shall have jurisdiction to review the regulation in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5 and to grant appropriate relief as provided in such chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The judgment of the court affirming or setting aside, in whole or in part, any such regulation of the Secretary shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Any action instituted under this subsection shall survive, notwithstanding any change in the person occupying the office of Secretary or any vacancy in such office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The remedies provided for in this subsection shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any other remedies provided by law.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Notification; exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Every manufacturer of electronic products who discovers that an electronic product produced, assembled, or imported by him has a defect which relates to the safety of use of such product by reason of the emission of electronic product radiation, or that an electronic product produced, assembled, or imported by him on or after the effective date of an applicable standard prescribed pursuant to section 360kk of this title fails to comply with such standard, shall immediately notify the Secretary of such defect or failure to comply if such product has left the place of manufacture and shall (except as authorized by paragraph (2)) with reasonable promptness furnish notification of such defect or failure to the persons (where known to the manufacturer) specified in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, in the opinion of such manufacturer, the defect or failure to comply is not such as to create a significant risk of injury, including genetic injury, to any person, he may, at the time of giving notice to the Secretary of such defect or failure to comply, apply to the Secretary for an exemption from the requirement of notice to the persons specified in subsection (b) of this section. If such application states reasonable grounds for such exemption, the Secretary shall afford such manufacturer an opportunity to present his views and evidence in support of the application, the burden of proof being on the manufacturer. If, after such presentation, the Secretary is satisfied that such defect or failure to comply is not such as to create a significant risk of injury, including genetic injury, to any person, he shall exempt such manufacturer from the requirement of notice to the persons specified in subsection (b) of this section and from the requirements of repair or replacement imposed by subsection (f) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The notification (other than to the Secretary) required by paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section shall be accomplished&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by certified mail to the first purchaser of such product for purposes other than resale, and to any subsequent transferee of such product; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by certified mail or other more expeditious means to the dealers or distributors of such manufacturer to whom such product was delivered.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requisite elements of notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The notifications required by paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section shall contain a clear description of such defect or failure to comply with an applicable standard, an evaluation of the hazard reasonably related to such defect or failure to comply, and a statement of the measures to be taken to repair such defect. In the case of a notification to a person referred to in subsection (b) of this section, the notification shall also advise the person of his rights under subsection (f) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Copies to Secretary of communications by manufacturers to dealers or distributors regarding defects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every manufacturer of electronic products shall furnish to the Secretary a true or representative copy of all notices, bulletins, and other communications to the dealers or distributors of such manufacturer or to purchasers (or subsequent transferees) of electronic products of such manufacturer regarding any such defect in such product or any such failure to comply with a standard applicable to such product. The Secretary shall disclose to the public so much of the information contained in such notice or other information obtained under section 360nn of this title as he deems will assist in carrying out the purposes of this part, but he shall not disclose any information which contains or relates to a trade secret or other matter referred to in section 1905 of title 18 unless he determines that it is necessary to carry out the purposes of this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Notice from Secretary to manufacturer of defects or failure to comply with standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If through testing, inspection, investigation, or research carried out pursuant to this part, or examination of reports submitted pursuant to section 360nn of this title, or otherwise, the Secretary determines that any electronic product&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) does not comply with an applicable standard prescribed pursuant to section 360kk of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) contains a defect which relates to the safety of use of such product by reason of the emission of electronic product radiation;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">he shall immediately notify the manufacturer of such product of such defect or failure to comply. The notice shall contain the findings of the Secretary and shall include all information upon which the findings are based. The Secretary shall afford such manufacturer an opportunity to present his views and evidence in support thereof, to establish that there is no failure of compliance or that the alleged defect does not exist or does not relate to safety of use of the product by reason of the emission of such radiation hazard. If after such presentation by the manufacturer the Secretary determines that such product does not comply with an applicable standard prescribed pursuant to section 360kk of this title, or that it contains a defect which relates to the safety of use of such product by reason of the emission of electronic product radiation, the Secretary shall direct the manufacturer to furnish the notification specified in subsection (c) of this section to the persons specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b) of this section (where known to the manufacturer), unless the manufacturer has applied for an exemption from the requirement of such notification on the ground specified in paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section and the Secretary is satisfied that such noncompliance or defect is not such as to create a significant risk of injury, including genetic injury, to any person.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Correction of defects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any electronic product is found under subsection (a) or (e) of this section to fail to comply with an applicable standard prescribed under <!-- PDFPage:260 -->this part or to have a defect which relates to the safety of use of such product, and the notification specified in subsection (c) of this section is required to be furnished on account of such failure or defect, the manufacturer of such product shall (1) without charge, bring such product into conformity with such standard or remedy such defect and provide reimbursement for any expenses for transportation of such product incurred in connection with having such product brought into conformity or having such defect remedied, (2) replace such product with a like or equivalent product which complies with each applicable standard prescribed under this part and which has no defect relating to the safety of its use, or (3) make a refund of the cost of such product. The manufacturer shall take the action required by this subsection in such manner, and with respect to such persons, as the Secretary by regulations shall prescribe.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Any electronic product offered for importation into the United States which fails to comply with an applicable standard prescribed under this part, or to which is not affixed a certification in the form of a label or tag in conformity with section 360kk(h) of this title shall be refused admission into the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury shall deliver to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, upon the latter's request, samples of electronic products which are being imported or offered for import into the United States, giving notice thereof to the owner or consignee, who may have a hearing before the Secretary of Health and Human Services. If it appears from an examination of such samples or otherwise that any electronic product fails to comply with applicable standards prescribed pursuant to section 360kk of this title, then, unless subsection (b) of this section applies and is complied with, (1) such electronic product shall be refused admission, and (2) the Secretary of the Treasury shall cause the destruction of such electronic product unless such article is exported, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, within 90 days after the date of notice of refusal of admission or within such additional time as may be permitted by such regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Bond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If it appears to the Secretary of Health and Human Services that any electronic product refused admission pursuant to subsection (a) of this section can be brought into compliance with applicable standards prescribed pursuant to section 360kk of this title, final determination as to admission of such electronic product may be deferred upon filing of timely written application by the owner or consignee and the execution by him of a good and sufficient bond providing for the payment of such liquidated damages in the event of default as the Secretary of Health and Human Services may by regulation prescribe. If such application is filed and such bond is executed the Secretary of Health and Human Services may, in accordance with rules prescribed by him, permit the applicant to perform such operations with respect to such electronic product as may be specified in the notice of permission.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Inspection of premises</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary finds for good cause that the methods, tests, or programs related to electronic product radiation safety in a particular factory, warehouse, or establishment in which electronic products are manufactured or held, may not be adequate or reliable, officers or employees duly designated by the Secretary, upon presenting appropriate credentials and a written notice to the owner, operator, or agent in charge, are thereafter authorized (1) to enter, at reasonable times, any area in such factory, warehouse, or establishment in which the manufacturer's tests (or testing programs) required by section 360kk(h) of this title are carried out, and (2) to inspect, at reasonable times and within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, the facilities and procedures within such area which are related to electronic product radiation safety. Each such inspection shall be commenced and completed with reasonable promptness. In addition to other grounds upon which good cause may be found for purposes of this subsection, good cause will be considered to exist in any case where the manufacturer has introduced into commerce any electronic product which does not comply with an applicable standard prescribed under this part and with respect to which no exemption from the notification requirements has been granted by the Secretary under section 360<em>ll</em>(a)(2) or 360<em>ll</em>(e) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Record keeping</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every manufacturer of electronic products shall establish and maintain such records (including testing records), make such reports, and provide such information, as the Secretary may reasonably require to enable him to determine whether such manufacturer has acted or is acting in compliance with this part and standards prescribed pursuant to this part and shall, upon request of an officer or employee duly designated by the Secretary, permit such officer or employee to inspect appropriate books, papers, records, and documents relevant to determining whether such manufacturer has acted or is acting in compliance with standards prescribed pursuant to this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Disclosure of technical data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every manufacturer of electronic products shall provide to the Secretary such performance data and other technical data related to safety as may be required to carry out the purposes of this part. The Secretary is authorized to require the manufacturer to give such notification of such performance and technical data at the time of original purchase to the ultimate purchaser of the electronic product, as he determines necessary to carry out the purposes of this part after consulting with the affected industry.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Public nature of reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Accident and investigation reports made under this part by any officer, employee, or agent of the Secretary shall be available for use in any civil, criminal, or other judicial proceeding arising out of such accident.
