<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) modify elements under this subsection for 1 or more drugs as appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Additional mechanisms to assure access</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The mechanisms under section 360bbb of this title to provide for expanded access for patients with serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be used to provide access for patients with a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the treatment of which is not an approved use for the drug, to a drug that is subject to elements to assure safe use under this subsection. The Secretary shall promulgate regulations for how a physician may provide the drug under the mechanisms of section 360bbb of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Waiver in public health emergencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may waive any requirement of this subsection during the period described in section 247d(a) of title 42 with respect to a qualified countermeasure described under section 247d&ndash;6a(a)(2) of such title, to which a requirement under this subsection has been applied, if the Secretary has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) declared a public health emergency under such section 247d; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) determined that such waiver is required to mitigate the effects of, or reduce the severity of, such public health emergency.</p>
