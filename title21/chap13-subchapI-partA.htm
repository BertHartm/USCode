<h3 class="section-head">&sect;801. Congressional findings and declarations: controlled substances</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings and declarations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Many of the drugs included within this subchapter have a useful and legitimate medical purpose and are necessary to maintain the health and general welfare of the American people.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:464 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) The illegal importation, manufacture, distribution, and possession and improper use of controlled substances have a substantial and detrimental effect on the health and general welfare of the American people.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A major portion of the traffic in controlled substances flows through interstate and foreign commerce. Incidents of the traffic which are not an integral part of the interstate or foreign flow, such as manufacture, local distribution, and possession, nonetheless have a substantial and direct effect upon interstate commerce because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) after manufacture, many controlled substances are transported in interstate commerce,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) controlled substances distributed locally usually have been transported in interstate commerce immediately before their distribution, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) controlled substances possessed commonly flow through interstate commerce immediately prior to such possession.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Local distribution and possession of controlled substances contribute to swelling the interstate traffic in such substances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Controlled substances manufactured and distributed intrastate cannot be differentiated from controlled substances manufactured and distributed interstate. Thus, it is not feasible to distinguish, in terms of controls, between controlled substances manufactured and distributed interstate and controlled substances manufactured and distributed intrastate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Federal control of the intrastate incidents of the traffic in controlled substances is essential to the effective control of the interstate incidents of such traffic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The United States is a party to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, and other international conventions designed to establish effective control over international and domestic traffic in controlled substances.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3002. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress hereby finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) a balanced, coordinated, multifaceted strategy for combating the growing drug abuse and drug trafficking problem in the United States is essential in order to stop the flow and abuse of drugs within our borders;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) a balanced, coordinated, multifaceted strategy for combating the narcotics drug abuse and trafficking in the United States should include&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) increased investigations of large networks of drug smuggler organizations;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) source country drug eradication;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) increased emphasis on stopping narcotics traffickers in countries through which drugs are transshipped;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) increased emphasis on drug education programs in the schools and workplace;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) increased Federal Government assistance to State and local agencies, civic groups, school systems, and officials in their efforts to combat the drug abuse and trafficking problem at the local level; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) increased emphasis on the interdiction of drugs and drug smugglers at the borders of the United States, in the air, at sea, and on the land;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) funds to support the interdiction of narcotics smugglers who threaten the transport of drugs through the air, on the sea, and across the land borders of the United States should be emphasized in the Federal Government budget process to the same extent as the other elements of a comprehensive antidrug effort are emphasized;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the Department of Defense and the use of its resources should be an integral part of a comprehensive, natonal [national] drug interdiction program;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the Federal Government civilian agencies engaged in drug interdiction, particularly the United States Customs Service and the Coast Guard, currently lack the aircraft, ships, radar, command, control, communications, and intelligence (C3I) system, and manpower resources necessary to mount a comprehensive attack on the narcotics traffickers who threaten the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the civilian drug interdiction agencies of the United States are currently interdicting only a small percentage of the illegal, drug smuggler penetrations in the United States every year;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the budgets for our civilian drug interdiction agencies, primarily the United States Customs Service and the Coast Guard, have not kept pace with those of the traditional investigative law enforcement agencies of the Department of Justice; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) since the amendment of the Posse Comitatus Act (18 U.S.C. 1385) in 1981, the Department of Defense has assisted in the effort to interdict drugs, but they can do more.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3003. PURPOSES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the purpose of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to increase the level of funding and resources available to civilian drug interdiction agencies of the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to increase the level of support from the Department of Defense as consistent with the Posse Comitatus Act [18 U.S.C. 1385], for interdiction of the narcotics traffickers before such traffickers penetrate the borders of the United States; and</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;801a. Congressional findings and declarations: psychotropic substances</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings and declarations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Congress has long recognized the danger involved in the manufacture, distribution, and use of certain psychotropic substances for nonscientific and nonmedical purposes, and has provided strong and effective legislation to control illicit trafficking and to <!-- PDFPage:472 -->regulate legitimate uses of psychotropic substances in this country. Abuse of psychotropic substances has become a phenomenon common to many countries, however, and is not confined to national borders. It is, therefore, essential that the United States cooperate with other nations in establishing effective controls over international traffic in such substances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The United States has joined with other countries in executing an international treaty, entitled the Convention on Psychotropic Substances and signed at Vienna, Austria, on February 21, 1971, which is designed to establish suitable controls over the manufacture, distribution, transfer, and use of certain psychotropic substances. The Convention is not self-executing, and the obligations of the United States thereunder may only be performed pursuant to appropriate legislation. It is the intent of the Congress that the amendments made by this Act, together with existing law, will enable the United States to meet all of its obligations under the Convention and that no further legislation will be necessary for that purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In implementing the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, the Congress intends that, consistent with the obligations of the United States under the Convention, control of psychotropic substances in the United States should be accomplished within the framework of the procedures and criteria for classification of substances provided in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 [21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.]. This will insure that (A) the availability of psychotropic substances to manufacturers, distributors, dispensers, and researchers for useful and legitimate medical and scientific purposes will not be unduly restricted; (B) nothing in the Convention will interfere with bona fide research activities; and (C) nothing in the Convention will interfere with ethical medical practice in this country as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services on the basis of a consensus of the views of the American medical and scientific community.</p>
