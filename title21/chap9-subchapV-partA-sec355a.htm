<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Other methods to meet the studies requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the sponsor or holder and the Secretary have not agreed in writing on the protocols for the studies, the studies requirement of subsection (b) or (c) of this section is satisfied when such studies have been completed and the reports accepted by the Secretary. Not later than 90 days after the submission of the reports of the studies, the Secretary shall accept or reject such reports and so notify the sponsor or holder.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Dispute resolution</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Request for labeling change and failure to agree</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Commissioner determines that an application with respect to which a pediatric study is conducted under this section is approvable and that the only open issue for final action on the application is the reaching of an agreement between the sponsor of the application and the Commissioner on appropriate changes to the labeling for the drug that is the subject of the application, not later than 180 days after the date of submission of the application&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the Commissioner shall request that the sponsor of the application make any labeling change that the Commissioner determines to be appropriate; and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) No effect on authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this subsection limits the authority of the United States to bring an enforcement action under this chapter when a drug lacks appropriate pediatric labeling. Neither course of action (the Pediatric Advisory Subcommittee of the Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee process or an en<!-- PDFPage:153 -->forcement action referred to in the preceding sentence) shall preclude, delay, or serve as the basis to stay the other course of action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Dissemination of pediatric information</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If a 180-day period under section 355(j)(5)(B)(iv) of this title overlaps with a 6-month exclusivity period under this section, so that the applicant for approval of a drug under section 355(j) of this title entitled to the 180-day period under that section loses a portion of the 180-day period to which the applicant is entitled for the drug, the 180-day period shall be extended from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the date on which the 180-day period would have expired by the number of days of the overlap, if the 180-day period would, but for the application of this subsection, expire after the 6-month exclusivity period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the date on which the 6-month exclusivity period expires, by the number of days of the overlap if the 180-day period would, but for the application of this subsection, expire during the six-month exclusivity period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A drug for which an application has been submitted or approved under section 355(j) of this title shall not be considered ineligible for approval under that section or misbranded under section 352 of this title on the basis that the labeling of the drug omits a pediatric indication or any other aspect of labeling pertaining to pediatric use when the omitted indication or other aspect is protected by patent or by exclusivity under clause (iii) or (iv) of section 355(j)(5)(D) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Labeling</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding clauses (iii) and (iv) of section 355(j)(5)(D) of this title, the Secretary may require that the labeling of a drug approved under section 355(j) of this title that omits a pediatric indication or other aspect of labeling as described in paragraph (1) include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a statement that, because of marketing exclusivity for a manufacturer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the drug is not labeled for pediatric use; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a drug for which there is an additional pediatric use not referred to in paragraph (1), the drug is not labeled for the pediatric use under paragraph (1); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a statement of any appropriate pediatric contraindications, warnings, or precautions that the Secretary considers necessary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Preservation of pediatric exclusivity and other provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection does not affect&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the availability or scope of exclusivity under this section;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the question of the eligibility for approval of any application under section 355(j) of this title that omits any other conditions of approval entitled to exclusivity under clause (iii) or (iv) of section 355(j)(5)(D) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) except as expressly provided in paragraphs (1) and (2), the operation of section 355 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Report</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">A drug may not receive any 6-month period under subsection (b) or (c) of this section unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on or before October 1, 2007, the Secretary makes a written request for pediatric studies of the drug;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) on or before October 1, 2007, an application for the drug is accepted for filing under section 355(b) of this title; and</p>
