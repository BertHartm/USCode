<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a licensed pharmacist in a State licensed pharmacy or a Federal facility, or</p>

<!-- PDFPage:128 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is based on a history of the licensed pharmacist or licensed physician receiving valid prescription orders for the compounding of the drug product, which orders have been generated solely within an established relationship between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the licensed pharmacist or licensed physician; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii)(I) such individual patient for whom the prescription order will be provided; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the physician or other licensed practitioner who will write such prescription order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compounded drug</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Licensed pharmacist and licensed physician</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A drug product may be compounded under subsection (a) of this section if the licensed pharmacist or licensed physician&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) compounds the drug product using bulk drug substances, as defined in regulations of the Secretary published at section 207.3(a)(4) of title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) that&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Drug product</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A drug product may be compounded under subsection (a) only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such drug product is not a drug product identified by the Secretary by regulation as a drug product that presents demonstrable difficulties for compounding that reasonably demonstrate an adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of that drug product; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such drug product is compounded in a State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) that has entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Secretary which addresses the distribution of inordinate amounts of compounded drug products interstate and provides for appropriate investigation by a State agency of complaints relating to compounded drug products distributed outside such State; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) that has not entered into the memorandum of understanding described in clause (i) and the licensed pharmacist, licensed pharmacy, or licensed physician distributes (or causes to be distributed) compounded drug products out of the State in which they are compounded in quantities that do not exceed 5 percent of the total prescription orders dispensed or distributed by such pharmacy or physician.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Advertising and promotion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A drug may be compounded under subsection (a) of this section only if the pharmacy, licensed pharmacist, or licensed physician does not advertise or promote the compounding of any particular drug, class of drug, or type of drug. The pharmacy, licensed pharmacist, or licensed physician may advertise and promote the compounding service provided by the licensed pharmacist or licensed physician.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall issue regulations to implement this section. Before issuing regulations to implement subsections (b)(1)(A)(i)(III), (b)(1)(C), or (b)(3)(A) of this section, the Secretary shall convene and consult an advisory committee on compounding unless the Secretary determines that the issuance of such regulations before consultation is necessary to protect the public health. The advisory committee shall include representatives from the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, the United States Pharmacopoeia, pharmacy, physician, and consumer <!-- PDFPage:129 -->organizations, and other experts selected by the Secretary.</p>

The Secretary shall include in the regulation the criteria for such substances, which shall include historical use, reports in peer reviewed medical literature, or other criteria the Secretary may identify.</p>
