<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjustments</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the total percentage change that occurred in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (all items; U.S. city average) for the 12 month period ending June 30 preceding the fiscal year for which fees are being established, or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The adjustment made each fiscal year by this subsection shall be added on a compounded basis to the sum of all adjustments made each fiscal year after fiscal year 2003 under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Workload adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the fee revenues established in subsection (b) of this section are adjusted for a fiscal year for inflation in accordance with paragraph (1), the fee revenues shall, beginning with fiscal year 2004, be adjusted further each fiscal year to reflect changes in the workload of the Secretary for the process for the review of device applications. With respect to such adjustment:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The adjustment shall be determined by the Secretary based on a weighted average of the change in the total number of premarket applications, investigational new device applications, premarket reports, supplements, and premarket notification submissions submitted to the Secretary. The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register the fee revenues and fees resulting from the adjustment and the supporting methodologies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Under no circumstances shall the adjustment result in fee revenues for a fiscal year that are less than the fee revenues for the fiscal year established in subsection (b) of this section, as adjusted for inflation under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Compensating adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the fee revenues established in subsection (b) of this section are adjusted for a fiscal year for inflation in accordance with paragraph (1), and for workload in accordance with paragraph (2), the fee revenues shall, beginning with fiscal year 2004, be adjusted further each fiscal year, if necessary, to reflect the cumulative amount by which collections for previous fiscal years, beginning with fiscal year 2003, fell below the cumulative revenue amounts for such fiscal years specified in subsection (b) of this section, adjusted for such fiscal years for inflation in accordance with paragraph (1), and for workload in accordance with paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Final year adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For fiscal year 2007, the Secretary may, in addition to adjustments under paragraphs (1) and (2), further increase the fees and fee revenues established in subsection (b) of this section if such adjustment is necessary to provide for not more than three months of operating reserves of carryover user fees for the process for the review of device applications for the first three months of fiscal year 2008. If such an adjustment is necessary, the rationale for the amount of the increase shall be contained in the annual notice establishing fee revenues and fees for fiscal year 2007. If the Secretary has carryover user fee balances for such process in excess of three months of such operating reserves, the adjustment under this paragraph shall not be made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Annual fee setting</h4>
