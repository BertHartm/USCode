<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Voluntary procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary determines, based on information gathered through the reportable food registry under section 350f of this title or through any other means, that there is a reasonable probability that an article of food (other than infant formula) is adulterated under section 342 of this title or misbranded under section 343(w) of this title and the use of or exposure to such article will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals, the Secretary shall provide the responsible party (as defined in section 350f of this title) with an opportunity to cease distribution and recall such article.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Prehearing order to cease distribution and give notice</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the responsible party refuses to or does not voluntarily cease distribution or recall <!-- PDFPage:139 -->such article within the time and in the manner prescribed by the Secretary (if so prescribed), the Secretary may, by order require, as the Secretary deems necessary, such person to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as applicable, immediately notify all persons&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Required additional information</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an article of food covered by a recall order issued under paragraph (1)(B) has been distributed to a warehouse-based third party logistics provider without providing such provider sufficient information to know or reasonably determine the precise identity of the article of food covered by a recall order that is in its possession, the notice provided by the responsible party subject to the order issued under paragraph (1)(B) shall include such information as is necessary for the warehouse-based third party logistics provider to identify the food.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Rules of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determination to limit areas affected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary requires a responsible party to cease distribution under paragraph (1)(A) of an article of food identified in subsection (a), the Secretary may limit the size of the geographic area and the markets affected by such cessation if such limitation would not compromise the public health.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Hearing on order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide the responsible party subject to an order under subsection (b) with an opportunity for an informal hearing, to be held as soon as possible, but not later than 2 days after the issuance of the order, on the actions required by the order and on why the article that is the subject of the order should not be recalled.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Post-hearing recall order and modification of order</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amendment of order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, after providing opportunity for an informal hearing under subsection (c), the Secretary determines that removal of the article from commerce is necessary, the Secretary shall, as appropriate&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Rule regarding alcoholic beverages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not initiate a mandatory recall or take any other action under this section with respect to any alcohol beverage until the Secretary has provided the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau with a reasonable opportunity to cease distribution and recall such article under the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Cooperation and consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall work with State and local public health officials in carrying out this section, as appropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) of the recall to consumers and retailers to whom such article was, or may have been, distributed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that includes, at a minimum&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Coordinated communication</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">To assist in carrying out the requirements of this subsection, the Secretary shall establish an incident command operation or a similar operation within the Department of Health and Human Services that will operate not later than 24 hours after the initiation of a mandatory recall or the recall of an article of food for which the use of, or exposure to, such article will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To reduce the potential for miscommunication during recalls or regarding investigations of a food borne illness outbreak associated with a food that is subject to a recall, each incident command operation or similar operation under paragraph (1) shall use regular staff and resources of the Department of Health and Human Services to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) ensure timely and coordinated communication within the Department, including enhanced communication and coordination between different agencies and organizations within the Department;</p>
