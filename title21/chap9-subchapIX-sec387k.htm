<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No person may introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any modified risk tobacco product unless an order issued pursuant to subsection (g) is effective with respect to such product.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Modified risk tobacco product</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;modified risk tobacco product&rdquo; means any tobacco product that is sold or distributed for use to reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-related disease associated with commercially marketed tobacco products.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sold or distributed</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to a tobacco product, the term &ldquo;sold or distributed for use to reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-related disease associated with commercially marketed tobacco products&rdquo; means a tobacco product&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the label, labeling, or advertising of which represents explicitly or implicitly that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the tobacco product presents a lower risk of tobacco-related disease or is less harmful than one or more other commercially marketed tobacco products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the tobacco product or its smoke contains a reduced level of a substance or presents a reduced exposure to a substance; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the tobacco product or its smoke does not contain or is free of a substance;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the label, labeling, or advertising of which uses the descriptors &ldquo;light&rdquo;, &ldquo;mild&rdquo;, or &ldquo;low&rdquo; or similar descriptors; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the tobacco product manufacturer of which has taken any action directed to consumers through the media or otherwise, other than by means of the tobacco product's label, labeling, or advertising, after June 22, 2009, respecting the product that would be reasonably expected to result in consumers believing that the tobacco product or its smoke may present a lower risk of disease or is less harmful than one or more commercially marketed tobacco products, or presents a reduced exposure to, or does not contain or is free of, a substance or substances.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No tobacco product shall be considered to be &ldquo;sold or distributed for use to reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-related disease associated with commercially marketed tobacco products&rdquo;, except as described in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Smokeless tobacco product</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No smokeless tobacco product shall be considered to be &ldquo;sold or distributed for use to reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-related disease associated with commercially marketed tobacco products&rdquo; solely because its label, labeling, or advertising uses the following phrases to describe such product and its use: &ldquo;smokeless tobacco&rdquo;, &ldquo;smokeless tobacco product&rdquo;, &ldquo;not consumed by smoking&rdquo;, &ldquo;does not produce smoke&rdquo;, &ldquo;smokefree&rdquo;, &ldquo;smoke-free&rdquo;, &ldquo;without smoke&rdquo;, &ldquo;no smoke&rdquo;, or &ldquo;not smoke&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effective date</h4>

The effective date shall be with respect to the date of manufacture, provided that, in any case, beginning 30 days after such effective date, a manufacturer shall not introduce into the domestic commerce of the United States any product, irrespective of the date of manufacture, that is not in conformance with paragraph (2)(A)(ii).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Tobacco dependence products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A product that is intended to be used for the treatment of tobacco dependence, including smoking cessation, is not a modified risk tobacco product under this section if it has been approved as a drug or device by the Food and Drug Administration and is subject to the requirements of subchapter V.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Filing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person may file with the Secretary an application for a modified risk tobacco product. Such application shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a description of the proposed product and any proposed advertising and labeling;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) data and information on how consumers actually use the tobacco product; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) such other information as the Secretary may require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Public availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall make the application described in subsection (d) publicly available (except matters in the application which are trade secrets or otherwise confidential, commercial information) and shall request comments by interested persons on the information contained in the application and on the label, labeling, and advertising accompanying such application.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Advisory Committee</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Marketing</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Modified risk products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary shall, with respect to an application submitted under this section, issue an order that a modified risk product may be commercially marketed only if the Secretary determines that the applicant has demonstrated that such product, as it is actually used by consumers, will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) significantly reduce harm and the risk of tobacco-related disease to individual tobacco users; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) benefit the health of the population as a whole taking into account both users of tobacco products and persons who do not currently use tobacco products.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule for certain products</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may issue an order that a tobacco product may be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, pursuant to an application under this section, with respect to a tobacco product that may not be commercially marketed under paragraph (1) if the Secretary makes the findings required under this paragraph and determines that the applicant has demonstrated that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such order would be appropriate to promote the public health;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any aspect of the label, labeling, and advertising for such product that would cause the tobacco product to be a modified risk tobacco product under subsection (b) is limited to an explicit or implicit representation that such tobacco product or its smoke does not contain or is free of a substance or contains a reduced level of a substance, or presents a reduced exposure to a substance in tobacco smoke;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) scientific evidence is not available and, using the best available scientific methods, cannot be made available without conducting long-term epidemiological studies for an application to meet the standards set forth in paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the scientific evidence that is available without conducting long-term epidemiological studies demonstrates that a measurable and substantial reduction in morbidity or mortality among individual tobacco users is reasonably likely in subsequent studies.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional findings required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To issue an order under subparagraph (A) the Secretary must also find that the applicant has demonstrated that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the magnitude of the overall reductions in exposure to the substance or substances which are the subject of the application is substantial, such substance or substances are harmful, and the product as actually used exposes consumers to the specified reduced level of the substance or substances;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the product as actually used by consumers will not expose them to higher levels of other harmful substances compared to the similar types of tobacco products then on the market unless such increases are minimal and the reasonably likely overall impact of use of the product remains a substantial and measurable reduction in overall morbidity and mortality among individual tobacco users;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) testing of actual consumer perception shows that, as the applicant proposes to label and market the product, consumers will not be misled into believing that the product&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is or has been demonstrated to be less harmful; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) presents or has been demonstrated to present less of a risk of disease than 1 or more other commercially marketed tobacco products; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) issuance of an order with respect to the application is expected to benefit the health of the population as a whole taking into account both users of tobacco products and persons who do not currently use tobacco products.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Applications subject to an order under this paragraph shall be limited to a term of not more than 5 years, but may be renewed upon a finding by the Secretary that the requirements of this paragraph continue to be satisfied based on the filing of a new application.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Agreements by applicant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">An order under this paragraph shall be conditioned on the applicant's agreement <!-- PDFPage:428 -->to conduct postmarket surveillance and studies and to submit to the Secretary the results of such surveillance and studies to determine the impact of the order on consumer perception, behavior, and health and to enable the Secretary to review the accuracy of the determinations upon which the order was based in accordance with a protocol approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Annual submission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The results of such postmarket surveillance and studies described in clause (ii) shall be submitted annually.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Basis</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making the determinations under paragraphs (1) and (2), the Secretary shall take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the relative health risks to individuals of the tobacco product that is the subject of the application;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the increased or decreased likelihood that persons who do not use tobacco products will start using the tobacco product that is the subject of the application;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the risks and benefits to persons from the use of the tobacco product that is the subject of the application as compared to the use of products for smoking cessation approved under subchapter V to treat nicotine dependence; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) comments, data, and information submitted by interested persons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Additional conditions for marketing</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Modified risk products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall require for the marketing of a product under this section that any advertising or labeling concerning modified risk products enable the public to comprehend the information concerning modified risk and to understand the relative significance of such information in the context of total health and in relation to all of the diseases and health-related conditions associated with the use of tobacco products.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Comparative claims</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may require the disclosure on the label of other substances in the tobacco product, or substances that may be produced by the consumption of that tobacco product, that may affect a disease or health-related condition or may increase the risk of other diseases or health-related conditions associated with the use of tobacco products.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall require, with respect to a product for which an applicant obtained an order under subsection (g)(1), that the applicant conduct postmarket surveillance and studies for such a tobacco product to determine the impact of the order issuance on consumer perception, behavior, and health, to enable the Secretary to review the accuracy of the determinations upon which the order was based, and to provide information that the Secretary determines is otherwise necessary regarding the use or health risks involving the tobacco product. The results of postmarket surveillance and studies shall be submitted to the Secretary on an annual basis.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Surveillance protocol</h4>
