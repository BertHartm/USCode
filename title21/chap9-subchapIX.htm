<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 111&ndash;31, div. A, &sect;2, June 22, 2009, 123 Stat. 1776, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The use of tobacco products by the Nation's children is a pediatric disease of considerable proportions that results in new generations of tobacco-dependent children and adults.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) A consensus exists within the scientific and medical communities that tobacco products are inherently dangerous and cause cancer, heart disease, and other serious adverse health effects.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Nicotine is an addictive drug.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Virtually all new users of tobacco products are under the minimum legal age to purchase such products.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Tobacco advertising and marketing contribute significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco products by adolescents.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Because past efforts to restrict advertising and marketing of tobacco products have failed adequately to curb tobacco use by adolescents, comprehensive restrictions on the sale, promotion, and distribution of such products are needed.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and regulatory authority and resources they need to address comprehensively the public health and societal problems caused by the use of tobacco products.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Federal and State public health officials, the public health community, and the public at large recognize that the tobacco industry should be subject to ongoing oversight.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Under article I, section 8 of the Constitution, the Congress is vested with the responsibility for regulating interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and use of tobacco products are activities in and substantially affecting interstate commerce because they are sold, marketed, advertised, and distributed in interstate commerce on a nationwide basis, and have a substantial effect on the Nation's economy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and use of such products substantially affect interstate commerce through the health care and other costs attributable to the use of tobacco products.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) It is in the public interest for Congress to enact legislation that provides the Food and Drug Administration with the authority to regulate tobacco products and the advertising and promotion of such products. The benefits to the American people from enacting such legislation would be significant in human and economic terms.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of premature death in America. It causes over 400,000 deaths in the United States each year, and approximately 8,600,000 Americans have chronic illnesses related to smoking.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Reducing the use of tobacco by minors by 50 percent would prevent well over 10,000,000 of today's children from becoming regular, daily smokers, saving over 3,000,000 of them from premature death due to tobacco-induced disease. Such a reduction in youth smoking would also result in approximately $75,000,000,000 in savings attributable to reduced health care costs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) Advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco products have been especially directed to attract young persons to use tobacco products, and these efforts have resulted in increased use of such products by youth. Past efforts to oversee these activities have not been successful in adequately preventing such increased use.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) In 2005, the cigarette manufacturers spent more than $13,000,000,000 to attract new users, retain current users, increase current consumption, and generate favorable long-term attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly portrays the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and healthful to minors.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) Tobacco product advertising is regularly seen by persons under the age of 18, and persons under the age of 18 are regularly exposed to tobacco product promotional efforts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(19) Through advertisements during and sponsorship of sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting activity.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(20) Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the number of young people who begin to use tobacco.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(21) The use of tobacco products in motion pictures and other mass media glamorizes its use for young people and encourages them to use tobacco products.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(22) Tobacco advertising expands the size of the tobacco market by increasing consumption of tobacco products including tobacco use by young people.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(23) Children are more influenced by tobacco marketing than adults: more than 80 percent of youth smoke three heavily marketed brands, while only 54 percent of adults, 26 and older, smoke these same brands.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(24) Tobacco company documents indicate that young people are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco market. Children, who tend to be more price sensitive than adults, are influenced by advertising and promotion practices that result in drastically reduced cigarette prices.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(25) Comprehensive advertising restrictions will have a positive effect on the smoking rates of young people.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(26) Restrictions on advertising are necessary to prevent unrestricted tobacco advertising from undermining legislation prohibiting access to young people and providing for education about tobacco use.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(27) International experience shows that advertising regulations that are stringent and comprehensive have a greater impact on overall tobacco use and young people's use than weaker or less comprehensive ones.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(28) Text only requirements, although not as stringent as a ban, will help reduce underage use of tobacco products while preserving the informational function of advertising.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(29) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt legislation to address the public health crisis created by actions of the tobacco industry.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(30) The final regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the August 28, 1996, issue of the Federal Register (61 Fed. Reg. 44615&ndash;44618) for inclusion as part 897 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, are consistent with the first amendment to the United States Constitution and with the standards set forth in the amendments made by this subtitle [probably means this division, see Short Title of 2009 Amendment note set out under section 301 of this title] for the regulation of tobacco products by the Food and Drug Administration, and the restriction on the sale and distribution of, including access to and the advertising and promotion of, tobacco products contained in such regulations are substantially related to accomplishing the public health goals of this division.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(31) The regulations described in paragraph (30) will directly and materially advance the Federal Government's substantial interest in reducing the number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and in preventing the life-threatening health consequences associated with to<!-- PDFPage:407 -->bacco use. An overwhelming majority of Americans who use tobacco products begin using such products while they are minors and become addicted to the nicotine in those products before reaching the age of 18. Tobacco advertising and promotion play a crucial role in the decision of these minors to begin using tobacco products. Less restrictive and less comprehensive approaches have not [been] and will not be effective in reducing the problems addressed by such regulations. The reasonable restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products contained in such regulations will lead to a significant decrease in the number of minors using and becoming addicted to those products.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(32) The regulations described in paragraph (30) impose no more extensive restrictions on communication by tobacco manufacturers and sellers than are necessary to reduce the number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and to prevent the life-threatening health consequences associated with tobacco use. Such regulations are narrowly tailored to restrict those advertising and promotional practices which are most likely to be seen or heard by youth and most likely to entice them into tobacco use, while affording tobacco manufacturers and sellers ample opportunity to convey information about their products to adult consumers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(33) Tobacco dependence is a chronic disease, one that typically requires repeated interventions to achieve long-term or permanent abstinence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(34) Because the only known safe alternative to smoking is cessation, interventions should target all smokers to help them quit completely.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(35) Tobacco products have been used to facilitate and finance criminal activities both domestically and internationally. Illicit trade of tobacco products has been linked to organized crime and terrorist groups.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(36) It is essential that the Food and Drug Administration review products sold or distributed for use to reduce risks or exposures associated with tobacco products and that it be empowered to review any advertising and labeling for such products. It is also essential that manufacturers, prior to marketing such products, be required to demonstrate that such products will meet a series of rigorous criteria, and will benefit the health of the population as a whole, taking into account both users of tobacco products and persons who do not currently use tobacco products.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(37) Unless tobacco products that purport to reduce the risks to the public of tobacco use actually reduce such risks, those products can cause substantial harm to the public health to the extent that the individuals, who would otherwise not consume tobacco products or would consume such products less, use tobacco products purporting to reduce risk. Those who use products sold or distributed as modified risk products that do not in fact reduce risk, rather than quitting or reducing their use of tobacco products, have a substantially increased likelihood of suffering disability and premature death. The costs to society of the widespread use of products sold or distributed as modified risk products that do not in fact reduce risk or that increase risk include thousands of unnecessary deaths and injuries and huge costs to our health care system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(38) As the National Cancer Institute has found, many smokers mistakenly believe that &lsquo;low tar&rsquo; and &lsquo;light&rsquo; cigarettes cause fewer health problems than other cigarettes. As the National Cancer Institute has also found, mistaken beliefs about the health consequences of smoking &lsquo;low tar&rsquo; and &lsquo;light&rsquo; cigarettes can reduce the motivation to quit smoking entirely and thereby lead to disease and death.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(39) Recent studies have demonstrated that there has been no reduction in risk on a population-wide basis from &lsquo;low tar&rsquo; and &lsquo;light&rsquo; cigarettes, and such products may actually increase the risk of tobacco use.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(40) The dangers of products sold or distributed as modified risk tobacco products that do not in fact reduce risk are so high that there is a compelling governmental interest in ensuring that statements about modified risk tobacco products are complete, accurate, and relate to the overall disease risk of the product.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(41) As the Federal Trade Commission has found, consumers have misinterpreted advertisements in which one product is claimed to be less harmful than a comparable product, even in the presence of disclosures and advisories intended to provide clarification.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(42) Permitting manufacturers to make unsubstantiated statements concerning modified risk tobacco products, whether express or implied, even if accompanied by disclaimers would be detrimental to the public health.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(43) The only way to effectively protect the public health from the dangers of unsubstantiated modified risk tobacco products is to empower the Food and Drug Administration to require that products that tobacco manufacturers sold or distributed for risk reduction be reviewed in advance of marketing, and to require that the evidence relied on to support claims be fully verified.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(44) The Food and Drug Administration is a regulatory agency with the scientific expertise to identify harmful substances in products to which consumers are exposed, to design standards to limit exposure to those substances, to evaluate scientific studies supporting claims about the safety of products, and to evaluate the impact of labels, labeling, and advertising on consumer behavior in order to reduce the risk of harm and promote understanding of the impact of the product on health. In connection with its mandate to promote health and reduce the risk of harm, the Food and Drug Administration routinely makes decisions about whether and how products may be marketed in the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(45) The Federal Trade Commission was created to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and to regulate unfair methods of competition. Its focus is on those marketplace practices that deceive or mislead consumers, and those that give some competitors an unfair advantage. Its mission is to regulate activities in the marketplace. Neither the Federal Trade Commission nor any other Federal agency except the Food and Drug Administration possesses the scientific expertise needed to implement effectively all provisions of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act [div. A of Pub. L. 111&ndash;31, see Short Title of 2009 Amendment note set out under section 301 of this title].</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(46) If manufacturers state or imply in communications directed to consumers through the media or through a label, labeling, or advertising, that a tobacco product is approved or inspected by the Food and Drug Administration or complies with Food and Drug Administration standards, consumers are likely to be confused and misled. Depending upon the particular language used and its context, such a statement could result in consumers being misled into believing that the product is endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration for use or in consumers being misled about the harmfulness of the product because of such regulation, inspection, approval, or compliance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(47) In August 2006 a United States district court judge found that the major United States cigarette companies continue to target and market to youth. USA v. Philip Morris, USA, Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 99&ndash;2496 (GK), August 17, 2006).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(48) In August 2006 a United States district court judge found that the major United States cigarette companies dramatically increased their advertising and promotional spending in ways that encourage youth to start smoking subsequent to the signing of the Master Settlement Agreement in 1998. USA v. Philip Morris, USA, Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 99&ndash;2496 (GK), August 17, 2006).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(49) In August 2006 a United States district court judge found that the major United States cigarette <!-- PDFPage:408 -->companies have designed their cigarettes to precisely control nicotine delivery levels and provide doses of nicotine sufficient to create and sustain addiction while also concealing much of their nicotine-related research. USA v. Philip Morris, USA, Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 99&ndash;2496 (GK), August 17, 2006).&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Special rule for cigarettes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Beginning 3 months after June 22, 2009, a cigarette or any of its component parts (including the tobacco, filter, or paper) shall not contain, as a constituent (including a smoke constituent) or additive, an artificial or natural flavor (other than tobacco or menthol) or an herb or spice, including strawberry, grape, orange, clove, cinnamon, pineapple, vanilla, coconut, licorice, cocoa, chocolate, cherry, or coffee, that is a characterizing flavor of the tobacco product or tobacco smoke. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to limit the Secretary's authority to take action under this section or other sections of this chapter applicable to menthol or any artificial or natural flavor, herb, or spice not specified in this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Beginning 2 years after June 22, 2009, a tobacco product manufacturer shall not use tobacco, including foreign grown tobacco, that contains a pesticide chemical residue that is at a level greater than is specified by any tolerance applicable under Federal law to domestically grown tobacco.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determinations</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In making a finding described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall consider scientific evidence concerning&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the risks and benefits to the population as a whole, including users and nonusers of tobacco products, of the proposed standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the increased or decreased likelihood that existing users of tobacco products will stop using such products; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the increased or decreased likelihood that those who do not use tobacco products will start using such products.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Additional considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the event that the Secretary makes a determination, set forth in a proposed tobacco product standard in a proposed rule, that it is appropriate for the protection of public health to require the reduction or elimination of an additive, constituent (including a smoke constituent), or other component of a tobacco product because the Secretary has found that the additive, constituent, or other component is or may be harmful, any party objecting to the proposed standard on the ground that the proposed standard will not reduce or eliminate the risk of illness or injury may provide for the Secretary's consideration scientific evidence that demonstrates that the proposed standard will not reduce or eliminate the risk of illness or injury.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Content of tobacco product standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A tobacco product standard established under this section for a tobacco product&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Periodic reevaluation of tobacco product standards</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) invite appropriate participation, through joint or other conferences, workshops, or other means, by informed persons representative of scientific, professional, industry, agricultural, or consumer organizations who in the Secretary's judgment can make a significant contribution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Considerations by Secretary</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Technical achievability</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking for the establishment, amendment, or revocation of any tobacco product standard.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Requirements of notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A notice of proposed rulemaking for the establishment or amendment of a tobacco product standard for a tobacco product shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) set forth a finding with supporting justification that the tobacco product standard is appropriate for the protection of the public health;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) invite interested persons to submit a draft or proposed tobacco product standard for consideration by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) invite interested persons to submit comments on structuring the standard so that it does not advantage foreign-grown tobacco over domestically grown tobacco; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Finding</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A regulation establishing a tobacco product standard shall set forth the date or dates upon which the standard shall take effect, but no such regulation may take effect before 1 year after the date of its publication unless the Secretary determines that an earlier effective date is necessary for the protection of the public health. Such date or dates shall be established so as to minimize, consistent with the public health, economic loss to, and disruption or dislocation of, domestic and international trade. In establishing such effective date or dates, the Secretary shall consider information submitted in connection with a proposed product standard by interested parties, including manufacturers and tobacco growers, regarding the technical achievability of compliance with the standard, and including information concerning the existence of patents that make it impossible to comply in the timeframe envisioned in the proposed standard. If the Secretary determines, based on the Secretary's evaluation of submitted comments, that a product standard can be met only by manufacturers requiring substantial changes to the methods of farming the domestically grown tobacco used by the manufacturer, the effective date of that product standard shall be not less than 2 years after the date of publication of the final regulation establishing the standard.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitation on power granted to the Food and Drug Administration</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) notification under this subsection is necessary to eliminate the unreasonable risk of such harm and no more practicable means is available under the provisions of this sub<!-- PDFPage:422 -->chapter (other than this section) to eliminate such risk,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Secretary may issue such order as may be necessary to assure that adequate notification is provided in an appropriate form, by the persons and means best suited under the circumstances involved, to all persons who should properly receive such notification in order to eliminate such risk.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary finds that there is a reasonable probability that a tobacco product contains a manufacturing or other defect not ordinarily contained in tobacco products on the market that would cause serious, adverse health consequences or death, the Secretary shall issue an order requiring the appropriate person (including the manufacturers, importers, distributors, or retailers of the tobacco product) to immediately cease distribution of such tobacco product. The order shall provide the person subject to the order with an opportunity for an informal hearing, to be held not later than 10 days after the date of the issuance of the order, on the actions required by the order and on whether the order should be amended to require a recall of such tobacco product. If, after providing an opportunity for such a hearing, the Secretary determines that inadequate grounds exist to support the actions required by the order, the Secretary shall vacate the order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any denial of an application shall, insofar as the Secretary determines to be practicable, be accompanied by a statement informing the applicant of the measures required to remove such application from deniable form (which measures may include further research by the applicant in accordance with 1 or more protocols prescribed by the Secretary).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:425 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Basis for finding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the finding as to whether the marketing of a tobacco product for which an application has been submitted is appropriate for the protection of the public health shall be determined with respect to the risks and benefits to the population as a whole, including users and nonusers of the tobacco product, and taking into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the increased or decreased likelihood that existing users of tobacco products will stop using such products; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Basis for action</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Investigations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (2)(A), whether permitting a tobacco product to be marketed would be appropriate for the protection of the public health shall, when appropriate, be determined on the basis of well-controlled investigations, which may include 1 or more clinical investigations by experts qualified by training and experience to evaluate the tobacco product.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Other evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary determines that there exists valid scientific evidence (other than evidence derived from investigations described in subparagraph (A)) which is sufficient to evaluate the tobacco product, the Secretary may authorize that the determination for purposes of paragraph (2)(A) be made on the basis of such evidence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Withdrawal and temporary suspension</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall, upon obtaining, where appropriate, advice on scientific matters from the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, and after due notice and opportunity for informal hearing for a tobacco product for which an order was issued under subsection (c)(1)(A)(i), issue an order withdrawing the order if the Secretary finds&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) on the basis of new information before the Secretary with respect to such tobacco product, evaluated together with the evidence before the Secretary when the application was reviewed, that the methods used in, or the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, or installation of such tobacco product do not conform with the requirements of section 387f(e) of this title and were not brought into conformity with such requirements within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the Secretary of nonconformity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) on the basis of new information before the Secretary, evaluated together with the evidence before the Secretary when the application was reviewed, that the labeling of such tobacco product, based on a fair evaluation of all material facts, is false or misleading in any particular and was not corrected within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the Secretary of such fact; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) on the basis of new information before the Secretary, evaluated together with the evidence before the Secretary when such order was issued, that such tobacco product is not shown to conform in all respects to a tobacco product standard which is in effect under section 387g of this title, compliance with which was a condition to the issuance of an order relating to the application, and that there is a lack of adequate information to justify the deviation from such standard.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The holder of an application subject to an order issued under paragraph (1) withdrawing an order issued pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) may, by petition filed on or before the 30th day after the date upon which such holder receives notice of such withdrawal, obtain review thereof in accordance with section 387<em>l</em> of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Temporary suspension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, after providing an opportunity for an informal hearing, the Secretary determines there is reasonable probability that the continuation of distribution of a tobacco product under an order would cause serious, adverse health consequences or death, that is greater than ordinarily caused by tobacco products on the market, the Secretary shall by order temporarily suspend the authority of the manufacturer to market the product. If the Secretary issues such an order, the Secretary shall proceed expeditiously under paragraph (1) to withdraw such application.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to a tobacco product, the term &ldquo;sold or distributed for use to reduce harm or the risk of tobacco-related disease associated with commercially marketed tobacco products&rdquo; means a tobacco product&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the label, labeling, or advertising of which represents explicitly or implicitly that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the tobacco product presents a lower risk of tobacco-related disease or is less harmful than one or more other commercially marketed tobacco products;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the tobacco product or its smoke does not contain or is free of a substance;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the label, labeling, or advertising of which uses the descriptors &ldquo;light&rdquo;, &ldquo;mild&rdquo;, or &ldquo;low&rdquo; or similar descriptors; or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Tobacco dependence products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A product that is intended to be used for the treatment of tobacco dependence, including smoking cessation, is not a modified risk tobacco product under this section if it has been approved as a drug or device by the Food and Drug Administration and is subject to the requirements of subchapter V.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Filing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person may file with the Secretary an application for a modified risk tobacco product. Such application shall include&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Modified risk products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary shall, with respect to an application submitted under this section, issue an order that a modified risk product may be commercially marketed only if the Secretary determines that the applicant has demonstrated that such product, as it is actually used by consumers, will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) significantly reduce harm and the risk of tobacco-related disease to individual tobacco users; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) benefit the health of the population as a whole taking into account both users of tobacco products and persons who do not currently use tobacco products.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule for certain products</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may issue an order that a tobacco product may be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, pursuant to an application under this section, with respect to a tobacco product that may not be commercially marketed under paragraph (1) if the Secretary makes the findings required under this paragraph and determines that the applicant has demonstrated that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such order would be appropriate to promote the public health;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any aspect of the label, labeling, and advertising for such product that would cause the tobacco product to be a modified risk tobacco product under subsection (b) is limited to an explicit or implicit representation that such tobacco product or its smoke does not contain or is free of a substance or contains a reduced level of a substance, or presents a reduced exposure to a substance in tobacco smoke;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) scientific evidence is not available and, using the best available scientific methods, cannot be made available without conducting long-term epidemiological studies for an application to meet the standards set forth in paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the scientific evidence that is available without conducting long-term epidemiological studies demonstrates that a measurable and substantial reduction in morbidity or mortality among individual tobacco users is reasonably likely in subsequent studies.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional findings required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To issue an order under subparagraph (A) the Secretary must also find that the applicant has demonstrated that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the magnitude of the overall reductions in exposure to the substance or substances which are the subject of the application is substantial, such substance or substances are harmful, and the product as actually used exposes consumers to the specified reduced level of the substance or substances;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the product as actually used by consumers will not expose them to higher levels of other harmful substances compared to the similar types of tobacco products then on the market unless such increases are minimal and the reasonably likely overall impact of use of the product remains a substantial and measurable reduction in overall morbidity and mortality among individual tobacco users;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) testing of actual consumer perception shows that, as the applicant proposes to label and market the product, consumers will not be misled into believing that the product&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is or has been demonstrated to be less harmful; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) presents or has been demonstrated to present less of a risk of disease than 1 or more other commercially marketed tobacco products; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-3em">Applications subject to an order under this paragraph shall be limited to a term of not more than 5 years, but may be renewed upon a finding by the Secretary that the requirements of this paragraph continue to be satisfied based on the filing of a new application.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Agreements by applicant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">An order under this paragraph shall be conditioned on the applicant's agreement <!-- PDFPage:428 -->to conduct postmarket surveillance and studies and to submit to the Secretary the results of such surveillance and studies to determine the impact of the order on consumer perception, behavior, and health and to enable the Secretary to review the accuracy of the determinations upon which the order was based in accordance with a protocol approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Annual submission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The results of such postmarket surveillance and studies described in clause (ii) shall be submitted annually.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the increased or decreased likelihood that persons who do not use tobacco products will start using the tobacco product that is the subject of the application;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the risks and benefits to persons from the use of the tobacco product that is the subject of the application as compared to the use of products for smoking cessation approved under subchapter V to treat nicotine dependence; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) comments, data, and information submitted by interested persons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Additional conditions for marketing</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Modified risk products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall require for the marketing of a product under this section that any advertising or labeling concerning modified risk products enable the public to comprehend the information concerning modified risk and to understand the relative significance of such information in the context of total health and in relation to all of the diseases and health-related conditions associated with the use of tobacco products.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Testing, reporting, and disclosure</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Contents of rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The regulations promulgated under subsection (a)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall require testing and reporting of tobacco product constituents, ingredients, and additives, including smoke constituents, by brand and subbrand that the Secretary determines should be tested to protect the public health, provided that, for purposes of the testing requirements of this paragraph, tobacco products manufactured and sold by a single tobacco product manufacturer that are identical in all respects except the labels, packaging design, logo, trade dress, trademark, brand name, or any combination thereof, shall be considered as a single brand; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may require that tobacco product manufacturers, packagers, or importers make disclosures relating to the results of the testing of tar and nicotine through labels or advertising or other appropriate means, and make disclosures regarding the results of the testing of other constituents, including smoke constituents, ingredients, or additives, that the Secretary determines should be disclosed to the public to protect the public health and will not mislead consumers about the risk of tobacco-related disease.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall have the authority under this subchapter to conduct or to require the testing, reporting, or disclosure of tobacco product constituents, including smoke constituents.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Small tobacco product manufacturers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) First compliance date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The initial regulations promulgated under subsection (a) shall not impose requirements on small tobacco product manufacturers before the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the end of the 2-year period following the final promulgation of such regulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the initial date set by the Secretary for compliance with such regulations by manufacturers that are not small tobacco product manufacturers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Testing and reporting initial compliance period</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) 4-year period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The initial regulations promulgated under subsection (a) shall give each small tobacco product manufacturer a 4-year period over which to conduct testing and reporting for all of its tobacco products. Subject to paragraph (1), the end of the first year of such 4-year period shall coincide with the initial date of compliance under this section set by the Secretary with respect to manufacturers that are not small tobacco product manufacturers or the end of the 2-year period following the final promulgation of such regulations, as described in paragraph (1)(A). A small tobacco product manufacturer shall be required&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to conduct such testing and reporting for 25 percent of its tobacco products during each year of such 4-year period; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to conduct such testing and reporting for its largest-selling tobacco products (as determined by the Secretary) before its other tobacco products, or in such other order of priority as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Case-by-case delay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Secretary may, on a case-by-case basis, delay the date by which an individual small tobacco product manufacturer must conduct testing and reporting for its tobacco products under this section based upon a showing of undue hardship to such manufacturer. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall not extend the deadline for a small tobacco product manufacturer to conduct testing and reporting for all of its tobacco products beyond a total of 5 years after the initial date of compliance under this section set by the Secretary with respect to manufacturers that are not small tobacco product manufacturers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Subsequent and additional testing and reporting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations promulgated under subsection (a) shall provide that, with respect to any subsequent or additional testing and reporting of tobacco products required under this section, such testing and reporting by a small tobacco product manufacturer shall be conducted in accordance with the timeframes described in paragraph (2)(A), except that, in the case of a new product, or if there has been a modification described in section 387j(a)(1)(B) of this title of any product of a small tobacco product manufacturer since the last testing and reporting required under this section, the Secretary shall require that any subsequent or additional testing and reporting be conducted in accordance with the same timeframe applicable to manufacturers that are not small tobacco product manufacturers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Joint laboratory testing services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall allow any 2 or more small tobacco product manufacturers to join together to purchase laboratory testing services required by this section on a group basis in order to ensure that such manufacturers receive access to, and fair pricing of, such testing services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Extensions for limited laboratory capacity</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations promulgated under subsection (a) shall provide that a small tobacco product manufacturer shall not be considered to be in violation of this section before the <!-- PDFPage:432 -->deadline applicable under paragraphs (3) and (4), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the tobacco products of such manufacturer are in compliance with all other requirements of this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the conditions described in paragraph (2) are met.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, the Secretary may delay the date by which a small tobacco product manufacturer must be in compliance with the testing and reporting required by this section until such time as the testing is reported if, not later than 90 days before the deadline for reporting in accordance with this section, a small tobacco product manufacturer provides evidence to the Secretary demonstrating that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the manufacturer has submitted the required products for testing to a laboratory and has done so sufficiently in advance of the deadline to create a reasonable expectation of completion by the deadline;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the products currently are awaiting testing by the laboratory; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) neither that laboratory nor any other laboratory is able to complete testing by the deadline at customary, nonexpedited testing fees.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Extension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary, taking into account the laboratory testing capacity that is available to tobacco product manufacturers, shall review and verify the evidence submitted by a small tobacco product manufacturer in accordance with paragraph (2). If the Secretary finds that the conditions described in such paragraph are met, the Secretary shall notify the small tobacco product manufacturer that the manufacturer shall not be considered to be in violation of the testing and reporting requirements of this section until the testing is reported or until 1 year after the reporting deadline has passed, whichever occurs sooner. If, however, the Secretary has not made a finding before the reporting deadline, the manufacturer shall not be considered to be in violation of such requirements until the Secretary finds that the conditions described in paragraph (2) have not been met, or until 1 year after the reporting deadline, whichever occurs sooner.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Additional extension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to the time that may be provided under paragraph (3), the Secretary may provide further extensions of time, in increments of no more than 1 year, for required testing and reporting to occur if the Secretary determines, based on evidence properly and timely submitted by a small tobacco product manufacturer in accordance with paragraph (2), that a lack of available laboratory capacity prevents the manufacturer from completing the required testing during the period described in paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in subsection (d) or (e) shall be construed to authorize the extension of any deadline, or to otherwise affect any timeframe, under any provision of this chapter or the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act other than this section.</p>
