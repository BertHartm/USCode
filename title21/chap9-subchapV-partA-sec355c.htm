<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall submit with the application the assessments described in paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Assessments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The assessments referred to in paragraph (1) shall contain data, gathered using appropriate formulations for each age group for which the assessment is required, that are adequate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug or the biological product is safe and effective.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Similar course of disease or similar effect of drug or biological product</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the course of the disease and the effects of the drug are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients, the Secretary may conclude that pediatric effectiveness can be extrapolated from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, usually supplemented with other information obtained in pediatric patients, such as pharmacokinetic studies.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Extrapolation between age groups</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A study may not be needed in each pediatric age group if data from one age group can be extrapolated to another age group.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">On the initiative of the Secretary or at the request of the applicant, the Secretary may defer submission of some or all assessments required under paragraph (1) until a specified date after approval of the drug or issuance of the license for a biological product if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the drug or biological product is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) pediatric studies should be delayed until additional safety or effectiveness data have been collected; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) there is another appropriate reason for deferral; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the applicant submits to the Secretary&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The information submitted through the annual review under clause (i) shall promptly be made available to the public in an easily accessible manner, including through the Web site of the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Waivers</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Full waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">On the initiative of the Secretary or at the request of an applicant, the Secretary shall <!-- PDFPage:185 -->grant a full waiver, as appropriate, of the requirement to submit assessments for a drug or biological product under this subsection if the applicant certifies and the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) necessary studies are impossible or highly impracticable (because, for example, the number of patients is so small or the patients are geographically dispersed);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) there is evidence strongly suggesting that the drug or biological product would be ineffective or unsafe in all pediatric age groups; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the drug or biological product&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) does not represent a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing therapies for pediatric patients; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) is not likely to be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Partial waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">On the initiative of the Secretary or at the request of an applicant, the Secretary shall grant a partial waiver, as appropriate, of the requirement to submit assessments for a drug or biological product under this subsection with respect to a specific pediatric age group if the applicant certifies and the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
