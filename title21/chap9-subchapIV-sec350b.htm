<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A dietary supplement which contains a new dietary ingredient shall be deemed adulterated under section 342(f) of this title unless it meets one of the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The dietary supplement contains only dietary ingredients which have been present in the food supply as an article used for food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) There is a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the dietary ingredient when used under the conditions recommended or suggested in the labeling of the dietary supplement will reasonably be expected to be safe and, at least 75 days before being introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, the manufacturer or distributor of the dietary ingredient or dietary supplement provides the Secretary with information, including any citation to published articles, which is the basis on which the manufacturer or distributor has concluded that a dietary supplement containing such dietary ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall keep confidential any information provided under paragraph (2) for 90 days following its receipt. After the expiration of such 90 days, the Secretary shall place such information on public display, except matters in the information which are trade secrets or otherwise confidential, commercial information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Petition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person may file with the Secretary a petition proposing the issuance of an order prescribing the conditions under which a new dietary ingredient under its intended conditions of use will reasonably be expected to be safe. The Secretary shall make a decision on such petition within 180 days of the date the petition is filed with the Secretary. For purposes of chapter 7 of title 5, the decision of the Secretary shall be considered final agency action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notification</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that the information in a new dietary ingredient notification submitted under this section for an article purported to be a new dietary ingredient is inadequate to establish that a dietary supplement containing such article will reasonably be expected to be safe because the article may be, or may contain, an anabolic steroid or an analogue of an anabolic steroid, the Secretary shall notify the Drug Enforcement Administration of such determination. Such notification by the Secretary shall include, at a minimum, the name of the dietary supplement or article, the name of the person or persons who marketed the product or made the submission of information regarding the article to the Secretary under this section, and any contact information for such person or persons that the Secretary has.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Definitions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the term &ldquo;anabolic steroid&rdquo; has the meaning given such term in section 802(41) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the term &ldquo;analogue of an anabolic steroid&rdquo; means a substance whose chemical structure is substantially similar to the chemical structure of an anabolic steroid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;New dietary ingredient&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;new dietary ingredient&rdquo; means a dietary ingredient that was not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994 and does not include any dietary ingredient which was marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994.</p>
