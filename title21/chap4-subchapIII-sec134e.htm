<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whoever knowingly violates any regulation promulgated pursuant to the provisions of sections 134 through 134d of this title shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $5,000 or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whoever violates any such regulation may be assessed a civil penalty by the Secretary not exceeding $1,000. The Secretary may issue an order assessing such civil penalty only after notice and an opportunity for an agency hearing on the record.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Injunctive proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may bring an action to enjoin the violation of, or to compel compliance with, any regulation promulgated or order issued under said sections, or to enjoin any interference by any person with an employee of the Department of Agriculture in carrying out any duties under said sections, whenever the Secretary has reason to believe that such person has violated, or is about to violate, any such regulation or order, or has interfered, or is about to interfere, with any such employee. Such action shall be brought in the United States district court, or the United States court of any Territory or possession, for the judicial district in which such person resides or transacts business or in which the violation, omission, or interference has occurred or is about to occur. Process in such cases may be served in any judicial district wherein the defendant resides or transacts business or wherever the defendant may be found, and subpenas for witnesses who are required to attend the court in any judicial district in any such cases may run into any other judicial district.</p>
