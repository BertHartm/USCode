<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Types of fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Beginning with respect to fiscal year 2009, the Secretary shall assess and collect fees in accordance with this section as follows:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Abbreviated application fee</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each person that submits, on or after July 1, 2008, an abbreviated application for a generic new animal drug shall be subject to a fee as established in subsection (b) for such an application.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The fee required by subparagraph (A) shall be due upon submission of the abbreviated application.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Exception for previously filed application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an abbreviated application was submitted by a person that paid the fee for such application, was accepted for filing, and was not approved or was withdrawn (without a waiver or refund), the submission of an abbreviated application for the same product by the same person (or the person's licensee, assignee, or successor) shall not be subject to a fee under subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Refund of fee if application refused for filing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall refund 75 percent of the fee paid under subparagraph (B) for any abbreviated application which is refused for filing.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:367 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Refund of fee if application withdrawn</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an abbreviated application is withdrawn after the application was filed, the Secretary may refund the fee or portion of the fee paid under subparagraph (B) if no substantial work was performed on the application after the application was filed. The Secretary shall have the sole discretion to refund the fee under this subparagraph. A determination by the Secretary concerning a refund under this subparagraph shall not be reviewable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Generic new animal drug product fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) who is named as the applicant in an abbreviated application or supplemental abbreviated application for a generic new animal drug product which has been submitted for listing under section 360 of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) who, after September 1, 2008, had pending before the Secretary an abbreviated application or supplemental abbreviated application,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall pay for each such generic new animal drug product the annual fee established in subsection (b). Such fee shall be payable for the fiscal year in which the generic new animal drug product is first submitted for listing under section 360 of this title, or is submitted for relisting under section 360 of this title if the generic new animal drug product has been withdrawn from listing and relisted. After such fee is paid for that fiscal year, such fee shall be payable on or before January 31 of each year. Such fee shall be paid only once for each generic new animal drug product for a fiscal year in which the fee is payable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Generic new animal drug sponsor fee</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) who meets the definition of a generic new animal drug sponsor within a fiscal year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) who, after September 1, 2008, had pending before the Secretary an abbreviated application, a supplemental abbreviated application, or an investigational submission,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">shall be assessed an annual fee established under subsection (b). The fee shall be paid on or before January 31 of each year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Amount of fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each generic new animal drug sponsor shall pay only 1 such fee each fiscal year, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 100 percent of the amount of the generic new animal drug sponsor fee published for that fiscal year under subsection (c)(3) for an applicant with more than 6 approved abbreviated applications.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 75 percent of the amount of the generic new animal drug sponsor fee published for that fiscal year under subsection (c)(3) for an applicant with more than 1 and fewer than 7 approved abbreviated applications.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) 50 percent of the amount of the generic new animal drug sponsor fee published for that fiscal year under subsection (c)(3) for an applicant with 1 or fewer approved abbreviated applications.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Fee amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (a)(1) and subsections (c), (d), (f), and (g), the fees required under subsection (a) shall be established to generate fee revenue amounts as follows:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Total fee revenues for application fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The total fee revenues to be collected in abbreviated application fees under subsection (a)(1) shall be $1,449,000 for fiscal year 2009, $1,532,000 for fiscal year 2010, $1,619,000 for fiscal year 2011, $1,712,000 for fiscal year 2012, and $1,809,000 for fiscal year 2013.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Total fee revenues for product fees</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Total fee revenues for sponsor fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The total fee revenues to be collected in generic new animal drug sponsor fees under subsection (a)(3) shall be $1,691,000 for fiscal year 2009, $1,787,000 for fiscal year 2010, $1,889,000 for fiscal year 2011, $1,997,000 for fiscal year 2012, and $2,111,000 for fiscal year 2013.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjustments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Workload adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The fee revenues shall be adjusted each fiscal year after fiscal year 2009 to reflect changes in review workload. With respect to such adjustment:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) This adjustment shall be determined by the Secretary based on a weighted average of the change in the total number of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs, manufacturing supplemental abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs, investigational generic new animal drug study submissions, and investigational generic new animal drug protocol submissions submitted to the Secretary. The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register the fees resulting from this adjustment and the supporting methodologies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Under no circumstances shall this workload adjustment result in fee revenues for a fiscal year that are less than the fee revenues for that fiscal year established in subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Final year adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For fiscal year 2013, the Secretary may further increase the fees to provide for up to 3 months of operating reserves of carryover user fees for the process for the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs for the first 3 months of fiscal year 2014. If the Food and Drug Administration has carryover balances for the process for the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs in excess of 3 months of such operating reserves, then this adjustment shall not be made. If this adjustment is necessary, then the rationale for the amount of the in<!-- PDFPage:368 -->crease shall be contained in the annual notice setting fees for fiscal year 2013.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Annual fee setting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish, 60 days before the start of each fiscal year beginning after September 30, 2008, for that fiscal year, abbreviated application fees, generic new animal drug sponsor fees, and generic new animal drug product fees based on the revenue amounts established under subsection (b) and the adjustments provided under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The total amount of fees charged, as adjusted under this subsection, for a fiscal year may not exceed the total costs for such fiscal year for the resources allocated for the process for the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Fee waiver or reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall grant a waiver from or a reduction of 1 or more fees assessed under subsection (a) where the Secretary finds that the generic new animal drug is intended solely to provide for a minor use or minor species indication.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect of failure to pay fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An abbreviated application for a generic new animal drug submitted by a person subject to fees under subsection (a) shall be considered incomplete and shall not be accepted for filing by the Secretary until all fees owed by such person have been paid. An investigational submission for a generic new animal drug that is submitted by a person subject to fees under subsection (a) shall be considered incomplete and shall not be accepted for review by the Secretary until all fees owed by such person have been paid. The Secretary may discontinue review of any abbreviated application for a generic new animal drug, supplemental abbreviated application for a generic new animal drug, or investigational submission for a generic new animal drug from a person if such person has not submitted for payment all fees owed under this section by 30 days after the date upon which they are due.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Assessment of fees</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Fees may not be assessed under subsection (a) for a fiscal year beginning after fiscal year 2008 unless appropriations for salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration for such fiscal year (excluding the amount of fees appropriated for such fiscal year) are equal to or greater than the amount of appropriations for the salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration for the fiscal year 2003 (excluding the amount of fees appropriated for such fiscal year) multiplied by the adjustment factor applicable to the fiscal year involved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary does not assess fees under subsection (a) during any portion of a fiscal year because of paragraph (1) and if at a later date in such fiscal year the Secretary may assess such fees, the Secretary may assess and collect such fees, without any modification in the rate, for abbreviated applications, generic new animal drug sponsors, and generic new animal drug products at any time in such fiscal year notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) relating to the date fees are to be paid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Crediting and availability of fees</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Fees authorized under subsection (a) shall be collected and available for obligation only to the extent and in the amount provided in advance in appropriations Acts. Such fees are authorized to be appropriated to remain available until expended. Such sums as may be necessary may be transferred from the Food and Drug Administration salaries and expenses appropriation account without fiscal year limitation to such appropriation account for salary and expenses with such fiscal year limitation. The sums transferred shall be available solely for the process for the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Collections and appropriation acts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The fees authorized by this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall be retained in each fiscal year in an amount not to exceed the amount specified in appropriation Acts, or otherwise made available for obligation for such fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall only be collected and available to defray increases in the costs of the resources allocated for the process for the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs (including increases in such costs for an additional number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human Services to be engaged in such process) over such costs, excluding costs paid from fees collected under this section, for fiscal year 2008 multiplied by the adjustment factor.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall be considered to have met the requirements of subparagraph (A)(ii) in any fiscal year if the costs funded by appropriations and allocated for the process for the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) are not more than 3 percent below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii)(I) are more than 3 percent below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii), and fees assessed for the fiscal year following the subsequent fiscal year are decreased by the amount in excess of 3 percent by which such costs fell below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) such costs are not more than 5 percent below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Authorization of appropriations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">as adjusted to reflect adjustments in the total fee revenues made under this section and changes in the total amounts collected by abbreviated application fees, generic new animal drug sponsor fees, and generic new animal drug product fees.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Offset</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the sum of the cumulative amount of fees collected under this section for the fiscal years 2009 through 2011 and the amount of fees estimated to be collected under this section for fiscal year 2012 exceeds the cumulative amount appropriated under paragraph (3) for the fiscal years 2009 through 2012, the excess amount shall be credited to the appropriation account of the Food and Drug Administration as provided in paragraph (1), and shall be subtracted from the amount of fees that would otherwise be authorized to be collected under this section pursuant to appropriation Acts for fiscal year 2013.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Collection of unpaid fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case where the Secretary does not receive payment of a fee assessed under subsection (a) within 30 days after it is due, such fee shall be treated as a claim of the United States Government subject to subchapter II of chapter 37 of title 31.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Written requests for waivers, reductions, and refunds</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section may not be construed to require that the number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human Services, for officers, employees, and advisory committees not engaged in the process of the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs, be reduced to offset the number of officers, employees, and advisory committees so engaged.</p>
