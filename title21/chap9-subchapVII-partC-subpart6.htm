<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment of fees</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to subsections (c) and (d), the Secretary shall establish the fees to be collected under this section for each fiscal year specified in subsection (a)(1), based on the methodology described under paragraph (2), and shall publish such fees in a Federal Register notice not later than 60 days before the start of each such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Fee methodology</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Fees amounts established for collection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) under subparagraph (A) of subsection (a)(1) for a fiscal year shall be based on the Secretary's estimate of 100 percent of the costs of the reinspection-related activities (including by type or level of reinspection activity, as the Secretary determines applicable) described in such subparagraph (A) for such year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) under subparagraph (B) of subsection (a)(1) for a fiscal year shall be based on the Secretary's estimate of 100 percent of the costs of the activities described in such subparagraph (B) for such year;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) under subparagraph (D) of subsection (a)(1) for a fiscal year shall be based on the Secretary's estimate of 100 percent of the costs of the activities described in such subparagraph (D) for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Other considerations</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Voluntary qualified importer program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In establishing the fee amounts under subparagraph (A)(iii) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall provide for the number of importers who have submitted to the Secretary a notice under section 384b(c) of this title informing the Secretary of the intent of such importer to participate in the program under section 384b of this title in such fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#379j-31_1_target" name="379j-31_1">1</a></sup> Recoupment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">In establishing the fee amounts under subparagraph (A)(iii) for the first 5 fiscal years after January 4, 2011, the Secretary shall include in such fee a reasonable surcharge that provides a recoupment of the costs expended by the Secretary to establish and implement the first year of the program under section 384b of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Crediting of fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In establishing the fee amounts under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall provide for the crediting of fees from the previous year to the next year if the Secretary overestimated the amount of fees needed to carry out such <!-- PDFPage:373 -->activities, and consider the need to account for any adjustment of fees and such other factors as the Secretary determines appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Published guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Not later than 180 days after January 4, 2011, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a proposed set of guidelines in consideration of the burden of fee amounts on small business.

The Secretary shall adjust the fee schedule for small businesses subject to such fees only through notice and comment rulemaking.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Use of fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall make all of the fees collected pursuant to clause&nbsp;<sup><a href="#379j-31_2_target" name="379j-31_2">2</a></sup> (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of paragraph (2)(A) available solely to pay for the costs referred to in such clause (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of paragraph (2)(A), respectively.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Fees under subsection (a) shall be refunded for a fiscal year beginning after fiscal year 2010 unless the amount of the total appropriations for food safety activities at the Food and Drug Administration for such fiscal year (excluding the amount of fees appropriated for such fiscal year) is equal to or greater than the amount of appropriations for food safety activities at the Food and Drug Administration for fiscal year 2009 (excluding the amount of fees appropriated for such fiscal year), multiplied by the adjustment factor under paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary does not assess fees under subsection (a) for a portion of a fiscal year because paragraph (1) applies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) at a later date in such fiscal year, such paragraph (1) ceases to apply,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the Secretary may assess and collect such fees under subsection (a), without any modification to the rate of such fees, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) relating to the date fees are to be paid.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adjustment factor</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The adjustment factor described in paragraph (1) shall be the total percentage change that occurred in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (all items; United States city average) for the 12-month period ending June 30 preceding the fiscal year, but in no case shall such adjustment factor be negative.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Compounded basis</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Limitation on amount of certain fees</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section and subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary may not collect fees in a fiscal year such that the amount collected&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) under subparagraph (B) of subsection (a)(1) exceeds $20,000,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) under subparagraphs (A) and (D) of subsection (a)(1) exceeds $25,000,000 combined.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a domestic facility (as defined in section 350d(b) of this title) or an importer becomes subject to a fee described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (D) of subsection (a)(1) after the maximum amount of fees has been collected by the Secretary under subparagraph (A), the Secretary may collect a fee from such facility or importer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Crediting and availability of fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Fees authorized under subsection (a) shall be collected and available for obligation only to the extent and in the amount provided in appropriations Acts. Such fees are authorized to remain available until expended.

The sums transferred shall be available solely for the purpose of paying the operating expenses of the Food and Drug Administration employees and contractors performing activities associated with these food safety fees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Collection of fees</h4>
