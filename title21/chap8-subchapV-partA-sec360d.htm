<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Reasonable assurance of safe and effective performance; periodic evaluation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The special controls required by section 360c(a)(1)(B) of this title shall include performance standards for a class II device if the Secretary determines that a performance standard is necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device. A class III device may also be considered a class II device for purposes of establishing a standard for the device under this section if the device has been reclassified as a class II device under a regulation under section 360c(e) of this title but such regulation provides that the reclassification is not to take effect until the effective date of such a standard for the device.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A performance standard established under this section for a device&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall include provisions to provide reasonable assurance of its safe and effective performance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall, where necessary to provide reasonable assurance of its safe and effective performance, include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) provisions respecting the construction, components, ingredients, and properties of the device and its compatibility with power systems and connections to such systems,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) provisions for the testing (on a sample basis or, if necessary, on an individual basis) of the device or, if it is determined that no other more practicable means are available to the Secretary to assure the conformity of the device to the standard, provisions for the testing (on a sample basis or, if necessary, <!-- PDFPage:165 -->on an individual basis) by the Secretary or by another person at the direction of the Secretary,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) provisions for the measurement of the performance characteristics of the device,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) provisions requiring that the results of each or of certain of the tests of the device required to be made under clause (ii) show that the device is in conformity with the portions of the standard for which the test or tests were required, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) a provision requiring that the sale and distribution of the device be restricted but only to the extent that the sale and distribution of a device may be restricted under a regulation under section 360j(e) of this title; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall, where appropriate, require the use and prescribe the form and content of labeling for the proper installation, maintenance, operation, and use of the device.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall provide for periodic evaluation of performance standards established under this section to determine if such standards should be changed to reflect new medical, scientific, or other technological data.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In carrying out his duties under this section, the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) use personnel, facilities, and other technical support available in other Federal agencies,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) consult with other Federal agencies concerned with standard-setting and other nationally or internationally recognized standard-setting entities, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) invite appropriate participation, through joint or other conferences, workshops, or other means, by informed persons representative of scientific, professional, industry, or consumer organizations who in his judgment can make a significant contribution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment of a standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking for the establishment, amendment, or revocation of any performance standard for a device.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A notice of proposed rulemaking for the establishment or amendment of a performance standard for a device shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) set forth a finding with supporting justification that the performance standard is appropriate and necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) set forth proposed findings with respect to the risk of illness or injury that the performance standard is intended to reduce or eliminate,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) invite interested persons to submit to the Secretary, within 30 days of the publication of the notice, requests for changes in the classification of the device pursuant to section 360c(e) of this title based on new information relevant to the classification, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) invite interested persons to submit an existing performance standard for the device, including a draft or proposed performance standard, for consideration by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A notice of proposed rulemaking for the revocation of a performance standard shall set forth a finding with supporting justification that the performance standard is no longer necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary shall provide for a comment period of not less than 60 days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, after publication of a notice in accordance with paragraph (1), the Secretary receives a request for a change in the classification of the device, the Secretary shall, within 60 days of the publication of the notice, after consultation with the appropriate panel under section 360c of this title, either deny the request or give notice of an intent to initiate such change under section 360c(e) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) After the expiration of the period for comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking published under paragraph (1) respecting a performance standard and after consideration of such comments and any report from an advisory committee under paragraph (5), the Secretary shall (i) promulgate a regulation establishing a performance standard and publish in the Federal Register findings on the matters referred to in paragraph (1), or (ii) publish a notice terminating the proceeding for the development of the standard together with the reasons for such termination. If a notice of termination is published, the Secretary shall (unless such notice is issued because the device is a banned device under section 360f of this title) initiate a proceeding under section 360c(e) of this title to reclassify the device subject to the proceeding terminated by such notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A regulation establishing a performance standard shall set forth the date or dates upon which the standard shall take effect, but no such regulation may take effect before one year after the date of its publication unless (i) the Secretary determines that an earlier effective date is necessary for the protection of the public health and safety, or (ii) such standard has been established for a device which, effective upon the effective date of the standard, has been reclassified from class III to class II. Such date or dates shall be established so as to minimize, consistent with the public health and safety, economic loss to, and disruption or dislocation of, domestic and international trade.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Secretary, upon his own initiative or upon petition of an interested person may by regulation, promulgated in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3)(B) of this subsection, amend or revoke a performance standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may declare a proposed amendment of a performance standard to be effective on and after its publication in the Federal Register and until the effective date of any final action taken on such amendment if he determines that making it so effective is in the public interest. A proposed amendment of a performance standard made so effective under the preceding sentence may not prohibit, during the period in which it is so effective, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of a device which conforms to such standard without the change or changes provided by such proposed amendment.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:166 --><p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) may on his own initiative refer a proposed regulation for the establishment, amendment, or revocation of a performance standard, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) shall, upon the request of an interested person which demonstrates good cause for referral and which is made before the expiration of the period for submission of comments on such proposed regulation refer such proposed regulation,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">to an advisory committee of experts, established pursuant to subparagraph (B), for a report and recommendation with respect to any matter involved in the proposed regulation which requires the exercise of scientific judgment. If a proposed regulation is referred under this subparagraph to an advisory committee, the Secretary shall provide the advisory committee with the data and information on which such proposed regulation is based. The advisory committee shall, within sixty days of the referral of a proposed regulation and after independent study of the data and information furnished to it by the Secretary and other data and information before it, submit to the Secretary a report and recommendation respecting such regulation, together with all underlying data and information and a statement of the reason or basis for the recommendation. A copy of such report and recommendation shall be made public by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall establish advisory committees (which may not be panels under section 360c of this title) to receive referrals under subparagraph (A). The Secretary shall appoint as members of any such advisory committee persons qualified in the subject matter to be referred to the committee and of appropriately diversified professional background, except that the Secretary may not appoint to such a committee any individual who is in the regular full-time employ of the United States and engaged in the administration of this chapter. Each such committee shall include as nonvoting members a representative of consumer interests and a representative of interests of the device manufacturing industry. Members of an advisory committee who are not officers or employees of the United States, while attending conferences or meetings of their committee or otherwise serving at the request of the Secretary, shall be entitled to receive compensation at rates to be fixed by the Secretary, which rates may not exceed the daily equivalent of the rate in effect for grade GS&ndash;18 of the General Schedule, for each day (including traveltime) they are so engaged; and while so serving away from their homes or regular places of business each member may be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by section 5703 of title 5 for persons in the Government service employed intermittently. The Secretary shall designate one of the members of each advisory committee to serve as chairman thereof. The Secretary shall furnish each advisory committee with clerical and other assistance, and shall by regulation prescribe the procedures to be followed by each such committee in acting on referrals made under subparagraph (A).</p>
