<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every person who is a manufacturer, importer, or distributor of a device intended for human use shall establish and maintain such records, make such reports, and provide such information, as the Secretary may by regulation reasonably require to assure that such device is not adulterated or misbranded and to otherwise assure its safety and effectiveness. Regulations prescribed under the preceding sentence&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall require a device manufacturer or importer to report to the Secretary whenever the manufacturer or importer receives or otherwise becomes aware of information that reasonably suggests that one of its marketed devices&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:165 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has malfunctioned and that such device or a similar device marketed by the manufacturer or importer would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall define the term &ldquo;serious injury&rdquo; to mean an injury that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is life threatening,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) may not require a manufacturer, importer, or distributor of a class I device to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) maintain for such a device records respecting information not in the possession of the manufacturer, importer, or distributor, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to submit for such a device to the Secretary any report or information&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) not in the possession of the manufacturer, importer, or distributor, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) on a periodic basis,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">unless such report or information is necessary to determine if the device should be reclassified or if the device is adulterated or misbranded; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) shall require distributors who submit such reports to submit copies of the reports to the manufacturer of the device for which the report was made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In prescribing such regulations, the Secretary shall have due regard for the professional ethics of the medical profession and the interests of patients.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be admissible into evidence or otherwise used in any civil action involving private parties unless the facility, individual, or physician who made the report had knowledge of the falsity of the information contained in the report.</p>
