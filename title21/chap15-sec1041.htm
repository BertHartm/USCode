Each violation to which this subparagraph applies shall be considered a separate offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No penalty shall be assessed against any person under this subsection unless the person is given notice and opportunity for a hearing on the record before the Secretary in accordance with sections 554 and 556 of title 5.</p>

The Secretary may modify the findings of the Secretary as to the facts, or make new findings, on the basis of the additional evidence so taken.</p>
