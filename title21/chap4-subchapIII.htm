<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, whenever he deems it necessary in order to guard against the introduction or dissemination of a communicable disease of livestock or poultry, may seize, quarantine, and dispose of, in a reasonable manner taking into consideration the nature of the disease and the necessity of such action to protect the livestock or poultry of the United States: (1) any animals which he finds are moving or are being handled or have moved or have been handled in interstate or foreign commerce contrary to any law or regulation administered by him for the prevention of the introduction or dissemination of any communicable disease of livestock or poultry; (2) any animals which he finds are moving into the United States, or interstate, and are affected with or have been exposed to any communicable disease dangerous to livestock or poultry; and (3) any animals which he finds have <!-- PDFPage:22 -->moved into the United States, or interstate, and at the time of such movement were so affected or exposed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of extraordinary emergency due to dangerous communicable disease; seizure, quarantine, and disposal of animals; action authorized only if adequate measures not taken by State or other jurisdiction; notice to State or other jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whereas the existence of any dangerous, communicable disease of livestock or poultry, such as foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest, or European fowl pest, on any premises in the United States would constitute a threat to livestock and poultry of the Nation and would seriously burden interstate and foreign commerce, whenever the Secretary determines that an extraordinary emergency exists because of the outbreak of such a disease anywhere in the United States, and that such outbreak threatens the livestock or poultry of the United States, he may seize, quarantine, and dispose of, in such manner as he deems necessary or appropriate, any animals in the United States which he finds are or have been affected with or exposed to any such disease and the carcasses of any such animals and any products and articles which he finds were so related to such animals as to be likely to be a means of disseminating any such disease: <em>Provided</em>, That action shall be taken under this subsection only if the Secretary finds that adequate measures are not being taken by the State or other jurisdiction. The Secretary shall notify the appropriate official of the State or other jurisdiction before any action is taken in any such State or other jurisdiction pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice to owner to quarantine or to dispose of animal, carcass, product, or article; action on failure to comply; costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary in writing may order the owner of any animal, carcass, product, or article referred to in subsection (a) or (b) of this section, or the agent of such owner, to maintain in quarantine, and to dispose of such animal, carcass, product, or article in such manner as the Secretary may direct pursuant to authority vested in him by such subsections. If such owner or agent fails to do so after receipt of such notice, the Secretary may take action as authorized by said subsections (a) and (b) and recover from such owner or agent the reasonable costs of any care, handling, and disposal incurred by the Secretary in connection therewith. Such costs shall not constitute a lien against the animals, carcasses, products, or articles involved. Costs collected under this section shall be credited to the current appropriation for carrying out animal disease control activities of the Department.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Compensation of owner; fair market value; payments from State or other source; availability of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary shall compensate the owner of any animal, carcass, product, or article destroyed pursuant to the provisions of this section. Such compensation shall be based upon the fair market value as determined by the Secretary, of any such animal, carcass, product, or article at the time of the destruction thereof. Compensation paid any owner under this subsection shall not exceed the difference between any compensation received by such owner from a State or other source and such fair market value of the animal, carcass, product, or article. Funds in the Treasury available for carrying out animal disease control activities of the Department of Agriculture shall be used for carrying out this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Restriction on payment of compensation in cases of violation of law or regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No such payment shall be made by the Secretary for any animal, carcass, product, or article which has been moved or handled by the owner thereof or his agent knowingly in violation of a law or regulation administered by the Secretary for the prevention of the interstate dissemination of the communicable disease, for which the animal, carcass, product, or article was destroyed or a law or regulation for the enforcement of which the Secretary enters or has entered into a cooperative agreement for the control and eradication of such disease, or for any animal which has moved into the United States contrary to such law or regulation administered by the Secretary for the prevention of the introduction of a communicable disease of livestock or poultry.</p>

Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to prevent the introduction or dissemination of livestock or poultry disease or pests, animals may be brought into the quarantine station from any country, including but not limited to those countries in which the Secretary of Agriculture determines that rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease exists, and subsequently moved into other parts of the United States in accordance with such conditions as the Secretary of Agriculture shall determine are adequate in order to prevent the introduction into and the dissemination within the United States of livestock or poultry diseases or pests. The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to cooperate in such manner as he deems appropriate, with other countries or with breeders&rsquo; organizations or similar organizations or with individuals regarding importation of animals into and through the quarantine station and to charge and collect reasonable fees for use of the facilities of such station from importers. Such fees shall be deposited into the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the appropriation charged with the operating expenses of the quarantine station.
