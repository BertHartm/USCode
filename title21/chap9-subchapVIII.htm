<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Imports; list of registered foreign establishments; samples from unregistered foreign establishments; examination and refusal of admission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury shall deliver to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, upon his request, samples of food, drugs, devices, and cosmetics which are being imported or offered for import into the United States, giving notice thereof to the owner or consignee, who may appear before the Secretary of Health and Human Services and have the right to introduce testimony. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall furnish to the Secretary of the Treasury a list of establishments registered pursuant to subsection (i) of section 360 of this title and shall request that if any drugs and devices manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed in an establishment not so registered are imported or offered for import into the United States, samples of such drugs and devices be delivered to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, with notice of such delivery to the owner or consignee, who may appear before the Secretary of Health and Human Services and have the right to introduce testimony. If it appears from the examination of such samples or otherwise that (1) such article has been manufactured, processed, or packed under insanitary conditions or, in the case of a device, the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, the manufacture, packing, storage, or installation of the device do not conform to the requirements of section 360j(f) of this title, or (2) such article is forbidden or restricted in sale in the country in which it was produced or from which it was exported, or (3) such article is adulterated, misbranded, or in violation of section 355 of this title, then such article shall be refused admission, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section. The Secretary of the Treasury shall cause the destruction of any such article refused admission unless such article is exported, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, within ninety days of the date of notice of such refusal <!-- PDFPage:301 -->or within such additional time as may be permitted pursuant to such regulations. Clause (2) of the third sentence of this paragraph&nbsp;<sup><a href="#381_1_target" name="381_1">1</a></sup> shall not be construed to prohibit the admission of narcotic drugs the importation of which is permitted under the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act [21 U.S.C. 951 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Disposition of refused articles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Pending decision as to the admission of an article being imported or offered for import, the Secretary of the Treasury may authorize delivery of such article to the owner or consignee upon the execution by him of a good and sufficient bond providing for the payment of such liquidated damages in the event of default as may be required pursuant to regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury. If it appears to the Secretary of Health and Human Services that an article included within the provisions of clause (3) of subsection (a) of this section can, by relabeling or other action, be brought into compliance with this chapter or rendered other than a food, drug, device, or cosmetic, final determination as to admission of such article may be deferred and, upon filing of timely written application by the owner or consignee and the execution by him of a bond as provided in the preceding provisions of this subsection, the Secretary may, in accordance with regulations, authorize the applicant to perform such relabeling or other action specified in such authorization (including destruction or export of rejected articles or portions thereof, as may be specified in the Secretary's authorization). All such relabeling or other action pursuant to such authorization shall in accordance with regulations be under the supervision of an officer or employee of the Department of Health and Human Services designated by the Secretary, or an officer or employee of the Department of the Treasury designated by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reimportation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) and section 384 of this title, no drug subject to section 353(b) of this title or composed wholly or partly of insulin which is manufactured in a State and exported may be imported into the United States unless the drug is imported by the manufacturer of the drug.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) The statement is accompanied by such certificates of analysis as are necessary to identify such article, unless the article is a device or is an article described in paragraph (4).</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Secretary may refuse admission to an article that otherwise would be imported into the United States under such subparagraph if the Secretary determines that there is credible evi<!-- PDFPage:302 -->dence or information indicating that such article is not intended to be further processed by the initial owner or consignee, or incorporated by the initial owner or consignee, into a drug, biological product, device, food, food additive, color additive, or dietary supplement that will be exported by the initial owner or consignee from the United States in accordance with subsection (e) of this section or section 382 of this title, or with section 262(h) of title 42.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) This section may not be construed as affecting the responsibility of the Secretary to ensure that articles imported into the United States under authority of subparagraph (A) meet each of the conditions established in such subparagraph for importation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The importation into the United States of blood, blood components, source plasma, or source leukocytes or of a component, accessory, or part thereof is not permitted pursuant to paragraph (3) unless the importation complies with section 262(a) of title 42 or the Secretary permits the importation under appropriate circumstances and conditions, as determined by the Secretary.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) which does not comply with an applicable requirement of section 360d or 360e of this title,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which under section 360j(g) of this title is exempt from either such section, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) which is a banned device under section 360f of this title,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">unless, in addition to the requirements of paragraph (1), either (i) the Secretary has determined that the exportation of the device is not contrary to public health and safety and has the approval of the country to which it is intended for export or (ii) the device is eligible for export under section 382 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A new animal drug that requires approval under section 360b of this title shall not be exported pursuant to paragraph (1) if such drug has been banned in the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#381_2_target" name="381_2">2</a></sup> If an article of food is being imported or offered for import into the United States, and such article is from a foreign facility for which a registration has not been submitted to the Secretary under section 350d of this title, such article shall be held at the port of entry for the article, and may not be delivered to the importer, owner, or consignee of the article, until the foreign facility is so registered.

An article of food imported or offered for import without submission of such notice in accordance with the requirements under this paragraph shall be refused admission into the United States. Nothing in this section may be construed as a limitation on the port of entry for an article of food.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Regulations under paragraph (1) shall require that a notice under such paragraph be provided by a specified period of time in advance of the time of the importation of the article of food involved or the offering of the food for import, which period shall be no less than the minimum amount of time necessary for the Secretary to receive, review, and appropriately respond to such notification, but may not exceed five days. In determining the specified period of time required under this subparagraph, the Secretary may consider, but is not limited to consideration of, the effect on commerce of such period of time, the locations of the various ports of entry into the United States, the various modes of transportation, the types of food imported into the United States, and any other such consideration. Nothing in the preceding sentence may be construed as a limitation on the obligation of the Secretary to receive, review, and appropriately respond to any notice under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) If an article of food is being imported or offered for import into the United States and a notice under paragraph (1) is not provided in advance in accordance with the requirements under paragraph (1), such article shall be held at the port of entry for the article, and may not be delivered to the importer, owner, or consignee of the article, until such notice is submitted to the Secretary, and the Secretary examines the notice and determines that the notice is in accordance with the requirements under paragraph (1). Subsection (b) of this section does not authorize the delivery of the article pursuant to the execution of a bond while the article is so held. The article shall be removed to a secure facility, as appropriate. During the period of time that such article is so held, the article shall not be transferred by any person from the port of entry into the United States for the article, or from the secure facility to which the article has been removed, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In carrying out clause (i) with respect to an article of food, the Secretary shall determine whether there is in the possession of the Secretary any credible evidence or information indicating that such article presents a threat of serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) This subsection may not be construed as limiting the authority of the Secretary to obtain information under any other provision of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) This subsection may not be construed as authorizing the Secretary to impose any requirements with respect to a food to the extent that it is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture pursuant to the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.), or the Egg Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 1031 et seq.).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Labeling of food refused admission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If a food has been refused admission under subsection (a) of this section, other than such a food that is required to be destroyed, the Secretary may require the owner or consignee of the food to affix to the container of the food a label that clearly and conspicuously bears the statement: &ldquo;UNITED STATES: REFUSED ENTRY&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) All expenses in connection with affixing a label under paragraph (1) shall be paid by the owner or consignee of the food involved, and in default of such payment, shall constitute a lien against future importations made by such owner or consignee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A requirement under paragraph (1) remains in effect until the Secretary determines that the food involved has been brought into compliance with this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Registration statement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an article that is a drug or device is being imported or offered for import into the United States, and the importer, owner, or consignee of such article does not, at the time of offering the article for import, submit to the Secretary a statement that identifies the registration under section 360(i) of this title of each establishment that with respect to such article is required under such section to register with the Secretary, the article may be refused admission. If the article is refused admission for failure to submit such a statement, the article shall be held at the port of entry for the article, and may <!-- PDFPage:305 -->not be delivered to the importer, owner, or consignee of the article, until such a statement is submitted to the Secretary. Subsection (b) of this section does not authorize the delivery of the article pursuant to the execution of a bond while the article is so held. The article shall be removed to a secure facility, as appropriate.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall publish, and update as necessary, guidance that accurately describes circumstances in which the Secretary will consistently grant waivers on a case-by-case basis under subparagraph (A), so that individuals may know with the greatest practicable degree of certainty whether a particular importation for personal use will be permitted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Drugs imported from Canada</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In particular, the Secretary shall by regulation grant individuals a waiver to permit individuals to import into the United States a prescription drug that&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commencement of program</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) pose no additional risk to the public's health and safety; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) result in a significant reduction in the cost of covered products to the American consumer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Termination of program</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, after the date that is 1 year after the effective date of the regulations under subsection (b) of this section and before the date that is 18 months after the effective date, the Secretary submits to Congress a certification that, in the opinion of the Secretary, based on substantial evidence obtained after the effective date, the benefits of implementation of this section do not outweigh any detriment of implementation of this section, this section shall cease to be effective as of the date that is 30 days after the date on which the Secretary submits the certification.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall not submit a certification under subparagraph (A) unless, after a hearing on the record under sections 556 and 557 of title 5, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i)(I) determines that it is more likely than not that implementation of this sec<!-- PDFPage:313 -->tion would result in an increase in the risk to the public health and safety;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) identifies specifically the causes of the increased risk; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(bb) if the Secretary determines that any measures described in item (aa) would require additional statutory authority, submits to Congress a report describing the legislation that would be required;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) identifies specifically, in qualitative and quantitative terms, the benefits that would result from implementation of this section (including the benefit of reductions in the cost of covered products to consumers in the United States, allowing consumers to procure needed medication that consumers might not otherwise be able to procure without foregoing other necessities of life); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii)(I) compares in specific terms the detriment identified under clause (i) with the benefits identified under clause (ii); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) determines that the benefits do not outweigh the detriment.</p>
