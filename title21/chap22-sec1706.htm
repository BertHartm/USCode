<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) State and local law enforcement agencies have committed resources to respond to the drug trafficking problem in the area, thereby indicating a determination to respond aggressively to the problem;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) drug-related activities in the area are having a harmful impact in other areas of the country; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a significant increase in allocation of Federal resources is necessary to respond adequately to drug-related activities in the area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Use of funds</h4>
