<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There is established in the Office a program to be known as the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Program&rdquo;).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of the Program is to reduce drug trafficking and drug production in the United States by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) facilitating cooperation among Federal, State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies to share information and implement coordinated enforcement activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) enhancing law enforcement intelligence sharing among Federal, State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) providing reliable law enforcement intelligence to law enforcement agencies needed to design effective enforcement strategies and operations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) supporting coordinated law enforcement strategies which maximize use of available resources to reduce the supply of illegal drugs in designated areas and in the United States as a whole.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Designation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Homeland Security, heads of the National Drug Control Program agencies, and the Governor of each applicable State, may designate any specified area of the United States as a high intensity drug trafficking area.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After making a designation under paragraph (1) and in order to provide Federal assistance to the area so designated, the Director may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) obligate such sums as are appropriated for the Program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) direct the temporary reassignment of Federal personnel to such area, subject to the approval of the head of the department or agency that employs such personnel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) take any other action authorized under section 1703 of this title to provide increased Federal assistance to those areas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) coordinate activities under this section (specifically administrative, recordkeeping, <!-- PDFPage:594 -->and funds management activities) with State, local, and tribal officials.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Petitions for designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall establish regulations under which a coalition of interested law enforcement agencies from an area may petition for designation as a high intensity drug trafficking area. Such regulations shall provide for a regular review by the Director of the petition, including a recommendation regarding the merit of the petition to the Director by a panel of qualified, independent experts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Factors for consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In considering whether to designate an area under this section as a high intensity drug trafficking area, the Director shall consider, in addition to such other criteria as the Director considers to be appropriate, the extent to which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the area is a significant center of illegal drug production, manufacturing, importation, or distribution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies have committed resources to respond to the drug trafficking problem in the area, thereby indicating a determination to respond aggressively to the problem;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) drug-related activities in the area are having a significant harmful impact in the area, and in other areas of the country; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a significant increase in allocation of Federal resources is necessary to respond adequately to drug-related activities in the area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Organization of high intensity drug trafficking areas</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Executive Board and officers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To be eligible for funds appropriated under this section, each high intensity drug trafficking area shall be governed by an Executive Board. The Executive Board shall designate a chairman, vice chairman, and any other officers to the Executive Board that it determines are necessary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Responsibilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Executive Board of a high intensity drug trafficking area shall be responsible for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) providing direction and oversight in establishing and achieving the goals of the high intensity drug trafficking area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) managing the funds of the high intensity drug trafficking area;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) reviewing and approving all reports to the Director on the activities of the high intensity drug trafficking area.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Board representation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">None of the funds appropriated under this section may be expended for any high intensity drug trafficking area, or for a partnership or region of a high intensity drug trafficking area, if the Executive Board for such area, region, or partnership, does not apportion an equal number of votes between representatives of participating Federal agencies and representatives of participating State, local, and tribal agencies. Where it is impractical for an equal number of representatives of Federal agencies and State, local, and tribal agencies to attend a meeting of an Executive Board in person, the Executive Board may use a system of proxy votes or weighted votes to achieve the voting balance required by this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) No agency relationship</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The eligibility requirements of this section are intended to ensure the responsible use of Federal funds. Nothing in this section is intended to create an agency relationship between individual high intensity drug trafficking areas and the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Use of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall ensure that no Federal funds appropriated for the Program are expended for the establishment or expansion of drug treatment programs, and shall ensure that not more than 5 percent of the Federal funds appropriated for the Program are expended for the establishment of drug prevention programs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Director may expend up to 10 percent of the amounts appropriated under this section on a discretionary basis, to respond to any emerging drug trafficking threat in an existing high intensity drug trafficking area, or to establish a new high intensity drug trafficking area or expand an existing high intensity drug trafficking area, in accordance with the criteria established under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consideration of impact</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In allocating funds under this subsection, the Director shall consider&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;469, title III, &sect;302(b), Dec. 29, 2006, 120 Stat. 3524, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) In the early morning hours of October 16, 2002, the home of Carnell and Angela Dawson was firebombed in apparent retaliation for Mrs. Dawson's notification to police about persistent drug distribution activity in their East Baltimore City neighborhood.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The arson claimed the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Dawson and their 5 young children, aged 9 to 14.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The horrific murder of the Dawson family is a stark example of domestic narco-terrorism.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) In all phases of counternarcotics law enforcement&mdash;from prevention to investigation to prosecution to reentry&mdash;the voluntary cooperation of ordinary citizens is a critical component.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Voluntary cooperation is difficult for law enforcement officials to obtain when citizens feel that cooperation carries the risk of violent retaliation by illegal drug trafficking organizations and their affiliates.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Public confidence that law enforcement is doing all it can to make communities safe is a prerequisite for voluntary cooperation among people who may be subject to intimidation or reprisal (or both).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:597 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Witness protection programs are insufficient on their own to provide security because many individuals and families who strive every day to make distressed neighborhoods livable for their children, other relatives, and neighbors will resist or refuse offers of relocation by local, State, and Federal prosecutorial agencies and because, moreover, the continued presence of strong individuals and families is critical to preserving and strengthening the social fabric in such communities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Where (as in certain sections of Baltimore City) interstate trafficking of illegal drugs has severe ancillary local consequences within areas designated as high intensity drug trafficking areas, it is important that supplementary High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program funds be committed to support initiatives aimed at making the affected communities safe for the residents of those communities and encouraging their cooperation with tribal, local, State, and Federal law enforcement efforts to combat illegal drug trafficking.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Combating Methamphetamine and Amphetamine in High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;310, div. B, title XXXVI, &sect;3624, Oct. 17, 2000, 114 Stat. 1232, provided that:</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Apportionment of Funds.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Factors in apportionment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Director shall apportion amounts appropriated for a fiscal year pursuant to the authorization of appropriations in subsection (b) for activities under subsection (a) among and within areas designated by the Director as high intensity drug trafficking areas based on the following factors:</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) The number of methamphetamine prosecutions and amphetamine prosecutions in Federal, State, or local courts in the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) The number of methamphetamine arrests and amphetamine arrests by Federal, State, or local law enforcement officials in the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) The amounts of methamphetamine, amphetamine, or listed chemicals (as that term is defined in section 102(33) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802(33)) seized by Federal, State, or local law enforcement officials in the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) Intelligence and predictive data from the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services showing patterns and trends in abuse, trafficking, and transportation in methamphetamine, amphetamine, and listed chemicals (as that term is so defined).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Certification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before the Director apportions any funds under this subsection to a high intensity drug trafficking area, the Director shall certify that the law enforcement entities responsible for clandestine methamphetamine and amphetamine laboratory seizures in that area are providing laboratory seizure data to the national clandestine laboratory database at the El Paso Intelligence Center.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Administrative Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not more than 5 percent of the amount appropriated in a fiscal year pursuant to the authorization of appropriations for that fiscal year in subsection (b) may be available in that fiscal year for administrative costs associated with activities under subsection (a).&rdquo;</p>
