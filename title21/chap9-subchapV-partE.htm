<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Emergency situations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may, under appropriate conditions determined by the Secretary, authorize the shipment of investigational drugs or investigational devices for the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of a serious disease or condition in emergency situations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Individual patient access to investigational products intended for serious diseases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person, acting through a physician licensed in accordance with State law, may request from a manufacturer or distributor, and any manufacturer or distributor may, after complying with the provisions of this subsection, provide to such physician an investigational drug or investigational device for the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of a serious disease or condition if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the licensed physician determines that the person has no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy available to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition involved, and that the probable risk to the person from the investigational drug or investigational device is not greater than the probable risk from the disease or condition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary determines that there is sufficient evidence of safety and effectiveness to support the use of the investigational drug or investigational device in the case described in paragraph (1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Secretary determines that provision of the investigational drug or investigational device will not interfere with the initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations to support marketing approval; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the sponsor, or clinical investigator, of the investigational drug or investigational device submits to the Secretary a clinical protocol consistent with the provisions of section 355(i) or 360j(g) of this title, including any regulations promulgated under section 355(i) or 360j(g) of this title, describing the use of the investigational drug or investigational device in a single patient or a small group of patients.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Treatment investigational new drug applications and treatment investigational device exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon submission by a sponsor or a physician of a protocol intended to provide widespread access to an investigational drug or investigational device for eligible patients (referred to in this subsection as an &ldquo;expanded access protocol&rdquo;), the Secretary shall permit such investigational drug or investigational device to be made available for expanded access under a treatment investigational new drug application or treatment investigational device exemption if the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) under the treatment investigational new drug application or treatment investigational device exemption, the investigational drug or investigational device is intended for use in the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy available to diagnose, monitor, or treat that stage of disease or condition in the population of patients to which the investigational drug or investigational device is intended to be administered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) the investigational drug or investigational device is under investigation in a controlled clinical trial for the use described in paragraph (1) under an investigational drug application in effect under section 355(i) of this title or investigational device exemption in effect under section 360j(g) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) all clinical trials necessary for approval of that use of the investigational drug or investigational device have been completed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the sponsor of the controlled clinical trials is actively pursuing marketing approval <!-- PDFPage:228 -->of the investigational drug or investigational device for the use described in paragraph (1) with due diligence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) in the case of an investigational drug or investigational device described in paragraph (3)(A), the provision of the investigational drug or investigational device will not interfere with the enrollment of patients in ongoing clinical investigations under section 355(i) or 360j(g) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) in the case of serious diseases, there is sufficient evidence of safety and effectiveness to support the use described in paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) in the case of immediately life-threatening diseases, the available scientific evidence, taken as a whole, provides a reasonable basis to conclude that the investigational drug or investigational device may be effective for its intended use and would not expose patients to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A protocol submitted under this subsection shall be subject to the provisions of section 355(i) or 360j(g) of this title, including regulations promulgated under section 355(i) or 360j(g) of this title. The Secretary may inform national, State, and local medical associations and societies, voluntary health associations, and other appropriate persons about the availability of an investigational drug or investigational device under expanded access protocols submitted under this subsection. The information provided by the Secretary, in accordance with the preceding sentence, shall be the same type of information that is required by section 282(j)(3) of title 42.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may, at any time, with respect to a sponsor, physician, manufacturer, or distributor described in this section, terminate expanded access provided under this section for an investigational drug or investigational device if the requirements under this section are no longer met.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section, the terms &ldquo;investigational drug&rdquo;, &ldquo;investigational device&rdquo;, &ldquo;treatment investigational new drug application&rdquo;, and &ldquo;treatment investigational device exemption&rdquo; shall have the meanings given the terms in regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
