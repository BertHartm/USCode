<p class="statutory-body">In case the collector, importer, or consignee shall protest against the finding of the examiner, the matter in dispute shall be referred for decision to the United States Board of Tea Appeals, to consist of three employees of the Department of Health and Human Services, to be designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. If such board shall, after due examination, find the tea in question to be equal in purity, quality, and fitness for consumption to the proper standards, a permit shall be issued by the collector for its release and delivery to the importer; but if upon such final reexamination by such board the tea shall be found to be inferior in purity, quality, and fitness for consumption to the said standards, the importer or consignee shall give a bond, with security satisfactory to the collector, to export said tea, or merchandise described as tea, out of the limits of the United States within a period of six months after such final reexamination; and if the same shall not have been exported within the time specified, the collector, at the expiration of that time, shall cause the same to be destroyed.</p>
