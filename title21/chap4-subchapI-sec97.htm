<p class="note-body">Sections 97 to 97d, act July 30, 1947, ch. 356, title I, &sect;1, 61 Stat. 531, 532, set up a meat inspection fund and provided for payment for meat inspection service by the persons or organizations who were furnished such inspection on and after July 1, 1947. These provisions ceased to be effective on July 1, 1948, under section 98 of this title which requires the cost of such inspection to be borne by the United States. The unobligated balance in the meat inspection fund was carried to the general fund of the Treasury by act June 19, 1948, ch. 543, &sect;1, 62 Stat. 515.</p>
