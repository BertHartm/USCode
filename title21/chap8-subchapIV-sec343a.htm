<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Statement on vending machines dispensing food containing saccharin respecting health risk; regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may by regulation require vending machines through which food containing saccharin is sold to bear a statement of the risks to health which may be presented by the use of saccharin. A regulation under this subsection shall require such statement to be located in a conspicuous place on such vending machine and as proximate as possible to the name of each food containing saccharin which is sold through such machine. Any food containing saccharin which is sold in a vending machine which does not meet any applicable requirement promulgated under this subsection shall, for purposes of this chapter, be considered a misbranded food.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Availability and distribution of information; review and revision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall (1) prepare information respecting the nature of the controversy surrounding the use of food containing saccharin, and (2) provide for the distribution of such information for display by retail establishments where such food is sold but not for immediate consumption. The Secretary may review and revise such information if he determines such action is necessary to reflect the current state of knowledge concerning the risks to health presented by the use of saccharin.</p>
