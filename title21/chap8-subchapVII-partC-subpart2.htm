<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Fee waiver or reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall grant a waiver from or a reduction of 1 or more fees under subsection (a) of this section where the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such waiver or reduction is necessary to protect the public health,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the assessment of the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation because of limited resources available to such person or other circumstances,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the fees to be paid by such person will exceed the anticipated present and future costs <!-- PDFPage:208 -->incurred by the Secretary in conducting the process for the review of human drug applications for such person, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) assessment of the fee for an application or a supplement filed under section 355(b)(1) of this title pertaining to a drug containing an active ingredient would be inequitable because an application for a product containing the same active ingredient filed by another person under section 355(b)(2) of this title could not be assessed fees under subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Fees may not be assessed under subsection (a) of this section for a fiscal year beginning after fiscal year 1993 unless appropriations for salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration for such fiscal year (excluding the amount of fees appropriated for such fiscal year) are equal to or greater than the amount of appropriations for the salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration for the fiscal year 1992 multiplied by the adjustment factor applicable to the fiscal year involved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary does not assess fees under subsection (a) of this section during any portion of a fiscal year because of paragraph (1) and if at a later date in such fiscal year the Secretary may assess such fees, the Secretary may assess and collect such fees, without any modification in the rate, for human drug applications and supplements, prescription drug establishments, and prescription drug products at any time in such fiscal year notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section relating to the date fees are to be paid.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Collections and appropriation acts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The fees authorized by this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall be collected in each fiscal year in an amount equal to the amount specified in appropriation Acts for such fiscal year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall only be collected and available to defray increases in the costs of the resources allocated for the process for the review of human drug applications (including increases in such costs for an additional number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human Services to be engaged in such process) over such costs for fiscal year 1992 multiplied by the adjustment factor.</p>
