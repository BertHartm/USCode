Each such inspection shall be commenced and completed with reasonable promptness. In addition to other grounds upon which good cause may be found for purposes of this subsection, good cause will be considered to exist in any case where the manufacturer has introduced into commerce any electronic product which does not comply with an applicable standard prescribed under this part and with respect to which no exemption from the notification requirements has been granted by the Secretary under section 360<em>ll</em>(a)(2) or 360<em>ll</em>(e) of this title.</p>

If a dealer or distributor discontinues the dealing in or distribution of electronic products, he shall turn the information over to the manufacturer.
