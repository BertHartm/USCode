<h4 class="note-head">Study</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 100&ndash;290, &sect;3(d), Apr. 18, 1988, 102 Stat. 91, directed Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study to determine whether the application of subchapter B of chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 360aa et seq. (relating to drugs for rare diseases and conditions), and 26 U.S.C. 28 (relating to tax credit) to medical devices or medical foods for rare diseases or conditions or to both was needed to encourage development of such devices and foods and report results of the study to Congress not later than one year after Apr. 18, 1988.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 1(b) of Pub. L. 97&ndash;414 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) there are many diseases and conditions, such as Huntington's disease, myoclonus, ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease), Tourette syndrome, and muscular dystrophy which affect such small numbers of individuals residing in the United States that the diseases and conditions are considered rare in the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) adequate drugs for many of such diseases and conditions have not been developed;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) drugs for these diseases and conditions are commonly referred to as &lsquo;orphan drugs&rsquo;;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) because so few individuals are affected by any one rare disease or condition, a pharmaceutical company which develops an orphan drug may reasonably expect the drug to generate relatively small sales in comparison to the cost of developing the drug and consequently to incur a financial loss;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) there is reason to believe that some promising orphan drugs will not be developed unless changes are made in the applicable Federal laws to reduce the costs of developing such drugs and to provide financial incentives to develop such drugs; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) it is in the public interest to provide such changes and incentives for the development of orphan drugs.&rdquo;</p>
