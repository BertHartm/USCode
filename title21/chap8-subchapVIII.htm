<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Imports; list of registered foreign establishments; samples from unregistered foreign establishments; examination and refusal of admission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury shall deliver to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, upon his request, samples of food, drugs, devices, and cosmetics which are being imported or offered for import into the United States, giving notice thereof to the owner or consignee, who may appear before the Secretary of Health and Human Services and have the right to introduce testimony. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall furnish to the Secretary of the Treasury a list of establishments registered pursuant to subsection (i) of section 360 of this title <!-- PDFPage:209 -->and shall request that if any drugs and devices manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed in an establishment not so registered are imported or offered for import into the United States, samples of such drugs and devices be delivered to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, with notice of such delivery to the owner or consignee, who may appear before the Secretary of Health and Human Services and have the right to introduce testimony. If it appears from the examination of such samples or otherwise that (1) such article has been manufactured, processed, or packed under insanitary conditions or, in the case of a device, the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, the manufacture, packing, storage, or installation of the device do not conform to the requirements of section 360j(f) of this title, or (2) such article is forbidden or restricted in sale in the country in which it was produced or from which it was exported, or (3) such article is adulterated, misbranded, or in violation of section 355 of this title, then such article shall be refused admission, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section. The Secretary of the Treasury shall cause the destruction of any such article refused admission unless such article is exported, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, within ninety days of the date of notice of such refusal or within such additional time as may be permitted pursuant to such regulations. Clause (2) of the third sentence of this paragraph&nbsp;<sup><a href="#381_1_target" name="381_1">1</a></sup> shall not be construed to prohibit the admission of narcotic drugs the importation of which is permitted under the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act [21 U.S.C. 951 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Disposition of refused articles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Pending decision as to the admission of an article being imported or offered for import, the Secretary of the Treasury may authorize delivery of such article to the owner or consignee upon the execution by him of a good and sufficient bond providing for the payment of such liquidated damages in the event of default as may be required pursuant to regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury. If it appears to the Secretary of Health and Human Services that an article included within the provisions of clause (3) of subsection (a) of this section can, by relabeling or other action, be brought into compliance with this chapter or rendered other than a food, drug, device, or cosmetic, final determination as to admission of such article may be deferred and, upon filing of timely written application by the owner or consignee and the execution by him of a bond as provided in the preceding provisions of this subsection, the Secretary may, in accordance with regulations, authorize the applicant to perform such relabeling or other action specified in such authorization (including destruction or export of rejected articles or portions thereof, as may be specified in the Secretary's authorization). All such relabeling or other action pursuant to such authorization shall in accordance with regulations be under the supervision of an officer or employee of the Department of Health and Human Services designated by the Secretary, or an officer or employee of the Department of the Treasury designated by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Charges concerning refused articles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All expenses (including travel, per diem or subsistence, and salaries of officers or employees of the United States) in connection with the destruction provided for in subsection (a) of this section and the supervision of the relabeling or other action authorized under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the amount of such expenses to be determined in accordance with regulations, and all expenses in connection with the storage, cartage, or labor with respect to any article refused admission under subsection (a) of this section, shall be paid by the owner or consignee and, in default of such payment, shall constitute a lien against any future importations made by such owner or consignee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reimportation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no drug subject to section 353(b) of this title which is manufactured in a State and exported may be imported into the United States unless the drug is imported by the manufacturer of the drug.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may authorize the importation of a drug the importation of which is prohibited by paragraph (1) if the drug is required for emergency medical care.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A food, drug, device, or cosmetic intended for export shall not be deemed to be adulterated or misbranded under this chapter if it&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) accords to the specifications of the foreign purchaser,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is not in conflict with the laws of the country to which it is intended for export,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is labeled on the outside of the shipping package that it is intended for export, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) is not sold or offered for sale in domestic commerce.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">This paragraph does not authorize the exportation of any new animal drug, or an animal feed bearing or containing a new animal drug, which is unsafe within the meaning of section 360b of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to any device&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) which does not comply with an applicable requirement of section 360d or 360e of this title,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which under section 360j(g) of this title is exempt from either such section, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) which is a banned device under section 360f of this title,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">unless, in addition to the requirements of paragraph (1), the Secretary has determined that the exportation of the device is not contrary to public health and safety and has the approval of the country to which it is intended for export.</p>
