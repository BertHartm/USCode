The applicant, and each of such affiliates, partners, and parent firms, shall certify that the information provided is a true and accurate copy of the actual tax forms they submitted to the Internal Revenue Service. If no tax forms are submitted for affiliates, partners, or parent firms, the applicant shall certify that the applicant has no affiliates, partners, or parent firms, respectively.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Evidence of qualification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An applicant shall pay the higher fees established by the Secretary each year unless the applicant submits evidence that it qualifies for the lower fee rate.
