<p class="statutory-body-1em">Registration information submitted under section 360 of this title by an establishment subject to a registration fee shall be considered incomplete and shall not be accepted by the Secretary until the registration fee under subsection (a)(3) owed for the establishment has been paid.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Conditions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Performance goals; termination of program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to the amount that, under the salaries and expenses account of the Food and Drug Administration, is appropriated for a fiscal year for devices and radiological products, fees may not be assessed under subsection (a) for the fiscal year, and the Secretary is not expected to meet any performance goals identified for the fiscal year, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount so appropriated for the fiscal year, excluding the amount of fees appropriated for the fiscal year, is more than 1 percent less than $205,720,000 multiplied by the adjustment factor applicable to such fiscal year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) fees were not assessed under subsection (a) for the previous fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary does not assess fees under subsection (a) during any portion of a fiscal year because of paragraph (1) and if at a later date in such fiscal year the Secretary may assess such fees, the Secretary may assess and collect such fees, without any modification in the rate for premarket applications, supplements, premarket reports, premarket notification submissions, 30-day notices, requests for classification information, periodic reporting concerning a class III device, and establishment registrations at any time in such fiscal year, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) relating to the date fees are to be paid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Crediting and availability of fees</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Fees authorized under subsection (a) of this section shall be collected and available for obligation only to the extent and in the amount provided in advance in appropriation Acts. Such fees are authorized to be appropriated to remain available until expended. Such sums as may be necessary may be transferred from the Food and Drug Administration salaries and expenses appropriation account without fiscal year limitation to such appropriation account for salaries and expenses with such fiscal year limitation. The sums transferred shall be available solely for the process for the review of device applications.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Collections and appropriation acts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The fees authorized by this section&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:329 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall be retained in each fiscal year in an amount not to exceed the amount specified in appropriation Acts, or otherwise made available for obligation, for such fiscal year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall only be collected and available to defray increases in the costs of the resources allocated for the process for the review of device applications (including increases in such costs for an additional number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human Services to be engaged in such process) over such costs, excluding costs paid from fees collected under this section, for fiscal year 2002 multiplied by the adjustment factor.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Compliance</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall be considered to have met the requirements of subparagraph (A)(ii) in any fiscal year if the costs funded by appropriations and allocated for the process for the review of device applications&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) are not more than 3 percent below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II)(aa) are more than 3 percent below the level specified in subparagraph (A)(ii), and fees assessed for a subsequent fiscal year are decreased by the amount in excess of 3 percent by which such costs fell below the level specified in such subparagraph; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(bb) such costs are not more than 5 percent below the level specified in such subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) More than 5 percent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">To the extent such costs are more than 5 percent below the specified level in subparagraph (A)(ii), fees may not be collected under this section for that fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Authorizations of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There are authorized to be appropriated for fees under this section&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) $67,118,000 for fiscal year 2012.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Offset</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the cumulative amount of fees collected during fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010, added to the amount estimated to be collected for fiscal year 2011, which estimate shall be based upon the amount of fees received by the Secretary through June 30, 2011, exceeds the amount of fees specified in aggregate in paragraph (3) for these four fiscal years, the aggregate amount in excess shall be credited to the appropriation account of the Food and Drug Administration as provided in paragraph (1), and shall be subtracted from the amount of fees that would otherwise be authorized to be collected under this section pursuant to appropriation Acts for fiscal year 2012.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Collection of unpaid fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case where the Secretary does not receive payment of a fee assessed under subsection (a) of this section within 30 days after it is due, such fee shall be treated as a claim of the United States Government subject to subchapter II of chapter 37 of title 31.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Written requests for refunds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To qualify for consideration for a refund under subsection (a)(2)(D) of this section, a person shall submit to the Secretary a written request for such refund not later than 180 days after such fee is due.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section may not be construed to require that the number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human Services, for officers, employees, and advisory committees not engaged in the process of the review of device applications, be reduced to offset the number of officers, employees, and advisory committees so engaged.</p>
