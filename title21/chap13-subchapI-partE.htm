<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization of use by Attorney General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any investigation relating to his functions under this subchapter with respect to controlled substances, listed chemicals, tableting machines, or encapsulating machines, the Attorney General may subpena witnesses, compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses, and require the production of any records (including books, papers, documents, and other tangible things which constitute or contain evidence) which the Attorney General finds relevant or material to the investigation. The attendance of witnesses and the production of records may be required from any place in any State or in any territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States at any designated place of hearing; except that a witness shall not be required to appear at any hearing more than 500 miles distant from the place where he was served with a subpena. Witnesses summoned under this section shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A subpena issued under this section may be served by any person designated in the subpena to serve it. Service upon a natural person may be made by personal delivery of the subpena to him. Service may be made upon a domestic or foreign corporation or upon a partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject to suit under a common name, by delivering the subpena to an officer, to a managing or general agent, or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process. The affidavit of the person serving the subpena entered a true copy thereof by the person serving it shall be proof of service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of contumacy by or refusal to obey a subpena issued to any person, the Attorney General may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which the investigation is carried on or of which the subpenaed person is an inhabitant, or in which he carries on business or may be found, to compel compliance with the subpena. The court may issue an order requiring the subpenaed person to appear before the Attorney General to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation. Any failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in any judicial district in which such person may be found.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) &ldquo;Controlled premises&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term &ldquo;controlled premises&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) places where original or other records or documents required under this subchapter are kept or required to be kept, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) places, including factories, warehouses, and other establishments, and conveyances, where persons registered under section 823 of this title (or exempt from registration under section 822(d) of this title or by regulation of the Attorney General) or regulated persons may lawfully hold, manufacture, distribute, dispense, administer, or otherwise dispose of controlled substances or listed chemicals or where records relating to those activities are maintained.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Grant of authority; scope of inspections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For the purpose of inspecting, copying, and verifying the correctness of records, reports, or other documents required to be kept or made under this subchapter and otherwise facilitating the carrying out of his functions under this subchapter, the Attorney General is authorized, in accordance with this section, to enter controlled premises and to conduct administrative inspections thereof, and of the things specified in this section, relevant to those functions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such entries and inspections shall be carried out through officers or employees (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;inspectors&rdquo;) designated by the Attorney General. Any such inspector, upon stating his purpose and presenting to the owner, operator, or agent in charge of such premises (A) appropriate credentials and (B) a written notice of his inspection authority (which notice in the case of an inspection requiring, or in fact supported by, an administrative inspection warrant shall consist of such warrant), shall have the right to enter such premises and conduct such inspection at reasonable times.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except as may otherwise be indicated in an applicable inspection warrant, the inspector shall have the right&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to inspect and copy records, reports, and other documents required to be kept or made under this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to inspect, within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, controlled premises and all pertinent equipment, finished and unfinished drugs, listed chemicals, and other substances or materials, containers, and labeling found therein, and, except as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection, all other things therein (including records, files, papers, processes, controls, and facilities) appropriate for verification of the records, reports, and documents referred to in clause (A) or otherwise bearing on the provisions of this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to inventory any stock of any controlled substance or listed chemical therein and obtain samples of any such substance or chemical.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Except when the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the controlled premises so consents in writing, no inspection authorized by this section shall extend to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) financial data;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) sales data other than shipment data; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) pricing data.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Situations not requiring warrants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A warrant under this section shall not be required for the inspection of books and records pursuant to an administrative subpena issued in accordance with section 876 of this title, nor for entries and administrative inspections (including seizures of property)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) with the consent of the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the controlled premises;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in situations presenting imminent danger to health or safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in situations involving inspection of conveyances where there is reasonable cause to believe that the mobility of the conveyance makes it impracticable to obtain a warrant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in any other exceptional or emergency circumstance where time or opportunity to apply for a warrant is lacking; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) in any other situations where a warrant is not constitutionally required.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Administrative inspection warrants; issuance; execution; probable cause</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Issuance and execution of administrative inspection warrants shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Any judge of the United States or of a State court of record, or any United States magistrate judge, may, within his territorial jurisdiction, and upon proper oath or affirma<!-- PDFPage:385 -->tion showing probable cause, issue warrants for the purpose of conducting administrative inspections authorized by this subchapter or regulations thereunder, and seizures of property appropriate to such inspections. For the purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;probable cause&rdquo; means a valid public interest in the effective enforcement of this subchapter or regulations thereunder sufficient to justify administrative inspections of the area, premises, building, or conveyance, or contents thereof, in the circumstances specified in the application for the warrant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A warrant shall issue only upon an affidavit of an officer or employee having knowledge of the facts alleged, sworn to before the judge or magistrate judge and establishing the grounds for issuing the warrant. If the judge or magistrate judge is satisfied that grounds for the application exist or that there is probable cause to believe they exist, he shall issue a warrant identifying the area, premises, building, or conveyance to be inspected, the purpose of such inspection, and, where appropriate, the type of property to be inspected, if any. The warrant shall identify the items or types of property to be seized, if any. The warrant shall be directed to a person authorized under subsection (b)(2) of this section to execute it. The warrant shall state the grounds for its issuance and the name of the person or persons whose affidavit has been taken in support thereof. It shall command the person to whom it is directed to inspect the area, premises, building, or conveyance identified for the purpose specified, and, where appropriate, shall direct the seizure of the property specified. The warrant shall direct that it be served during normal business hours. It shall designate the judge or magistrate judge to whom it shall be returned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A warrant issued pursuant to this section must be executed and returned within ten days of its date unless, upon a showing by the United States of a need therefor, the judge or magistrate judge allows additional time in the warrant. If property is seized pursuant to a warrant, the person executing the warrant shall give to the person from whom or from whose premises the property was taken a copy of the warrant and a receipt for the property taken or shall leave the copy and receipt at the place from which the property was taken. The return of the warrant shall be made promptly and shall be accompanied by a written inventory of any property taken. The inventory shall be made in the presence of the person executing the warrant and of the person from whose possession or premises the property was taken, if they are present, or in the presence of at least one credible person other than the person making such inventory, and shall be verified by the person executing the warrant. The judge or magistrate judge, upon request, shall deliver a copy of the inventory to the person from whom or from whose premises the property was taken and the applicant for the warrant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The judge or magistrate judge who has issued a warrant under this section shall attach to the warrant a copy of the return and all papers filed in connection therewith and shall file them with the clerk of the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the inspection was made.</p>
