<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Types of direct-to-consumer television advertisement review fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Beginning in fiscal year 2008, the Secretary shall assess and collect fees in accordance with this section as follows:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Advisory review fee</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to a proposed direct-to-consumer television advertisement (referred to in this section as a &ldquo;DTC advertisement&rdquo;), each person that on or after October 1, 2007, submits such an advertisement for advisory review by the Secretary prior to its initial public dissemination shall, except as provided in subparagraph (B), be subject to a fee established under subsection (c)(3).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception for required submissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A DTC advertisement that is required to be submitted to the Secretary prior to initial public dissemination is not subject to a fee under subparagraph (A) unless the sponsor designates the submission as a submission for advisory review.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Notice to Secretary of number of advertisements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than June 1 of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall publish a notice in the Federal Register requesting any person to notify the Secretary within 30 days of the number of DTC advertisements the person intends to submit for advisory review in the next fiscal year. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, for fiscal year 2008, the Secretary shall publish such a notice in the Federal Register not later than 30 days after September 27, 2007.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Payment</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The fee required by subparagraph (A) (referred to in this section as &ldquo;an advisory review fee&rdquo;) shall be due not later than October 1 of the fiscal year in which the DTC advertisement involved is intended to be submitted for advisory review, subject to subparagraph (F)(i). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the advisory review fee for any DTC advertisement that is intended to be submitted for advisory review during fiscal year 2008 shall be due not later than 120 days after September 27, 2007, or an earlier date as specified by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Effect of submission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Notification of the Secretary under subparagraph (C) of the number of DTC adver<!-- PDFPage:321 -->tisements a person intends to submit for advisory review is a legally binding commitment by that person to pay the annual advisory review fee for that number of submissions on or before October 1 of the fiscal year in which the advertisement is intended to be submitted. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the commitment shall be a legally binding commitment by that person to pay the annual advisory review fee for that number of submissions for fiscal year 2008 by the date specified in clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Notice regarding carryover submissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In making a notification under subparagraph (C), the person involved shall in addition notify the Secretary if under subparagraph (F)(i) the person intends to submit a DTC advertisement for which the advisory review fee has already been paid. If the person does not so notify the Secretary, each DTC advertisement submitted by the person for advisory review in the fiscal year involved shall be subject to the advisory review fee.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Modification of advisory review fee</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Late payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If a person has submitted a notification under subparagraph (C) with respect to a fiscal year and has not paid all advisory review fees due under subparagraph (D) not later than November 1 of such fiscal year (or, in the case of such a notification submitted with respect to fiscal year 2008, not later than 150 days after September 27, 2007, or an earlier date specified by the Secretary), the fees shall be regarded as late and an increase in the amount of fees applies in accordance with this clause, notwithstanding any other provision of this section. For such person, all advisory review fees for such fiscal year shall be due and payable 20 days before any direct-to-consumer advertisement is submitted to the Secretary for advisory review, and each such fee shall be equal to 150 percent of the fee that otherwise would have applied pursuant to subsection (c)(3).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Exceeding identified number of submissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If a person submits a number of DTC advertisements for advisory review in a fiscal year that exceeds the number identified by the person under subparagraph (C), an increase in the amount of fees applies under this clause for each submission in excess of such number, notwithstanding any other provision of this section. For each such DTC advertisement, the advisory review fee shall be due and payable 20 days before the advertisement is submitted to the Secretary, and the fee shall be equal to 150 percent of the fee that otherwise would have applied pursuant to subsection (c)(3).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Limits</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Submissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For each advisory review fee paid by a person for a fiscal year, the person is entitled to acceptance for advisory review by the Secretary of one DTC advertisement and acceptance of one resubmission for advisory review of the same advertisement. The advertisement shall be submitted for review in the fiscal year for which the fee was assessed, except that a person may carry over not more than one paid advisory review submission to the next fiscal year. Resubmissions may be submitted without regard to the fiscal year of the initial advisory review submission.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) No refunds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided by subsections (d)(4) and (f), fees paid under this section shall not be refunded.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) No waivers, exemptions, or reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall not grant a waiver, exemption, or reduction of any fees due or payable under this section.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Right to advisory review not transferable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The right to an advisory review under this paragraph is not transferable, except to a successor in interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Operating reserve fee</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each person that on or after October 1, 2007, is assessed an advisory review fee under paragraph (1) shall be subject to fee&nbsp;<sup><a href="#379h-1_1_target" name="379h-1_1">1</a></sup> established under subsection (d)(2) (referred to in this section as an &ldquo;operating reserve fee&rdquo;) for the first fiscal year in which an advisory review fee is assessed to such person. The person is not subject to an operating reserve fee for any other fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the operating reserve fee shall be due no later than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) October 1 of the first fiscal year in which the person is required to pay an advisory review fee under paragraph (1); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for fiscal year 2008, 120 days after September 27, 2007, or an earlier date specified by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Late notice of submission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, in the first fiscal year of a person's participation in the program under this section, that person submits any DTC advertisements for advisory review that are in excess of the number identified by that person in response to the Federal Register notice described in subsection (a)(1)(C), that person shall pay an operating reserve fee for each of those advisory reviews equal to the advisory review fee for each submission established under paragraph (1)(E)(ii). Fees required by this subparagraph shall be in addition to any fees required by subparagraph (A). Fees <!-- PDFPage:322 -->under this subparagraph shall be due 20 days before any DTC advertisement is submitted by such person to the Secretary for advisory review.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Late payment</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (B), and subject to clause (ii), an operating reserve fee shall be regarded as late if the person required to pay the fee has not paid the complete operating reserve fee by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) for fiscal year 2008, 150 days after September 27, 2007, or an earlier date specified by the Secretary; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) in any subsequent year, November 1.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Complete payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The complete operating reserve fee shall be due and payable 20 days before any DTC advertisement is submitted by such person to the Secretary for advisory review.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an operating reserve fee that is regarded as late under this subparagraph shall be equal to 150 percent of the operating reserve fee that otherwise would have applied pursuant to subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Advisory review fee revenue amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Fees under subsection (a)(1) shall be established to generate revenue amounts of $6,250,000 for each of fiscal years 2008 through 2012, as adjusted pursuant to subsections (c) and (g)(4).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjustments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Inflation adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Beginning with fiscal year 2009, the revenues established in subsection (b) shall be adjusted by the Secretary by notice, published in the Federal Register, for a fiscal year to reflect the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the total percentage change that occurred in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (all items; U.S. city average), for the 12-month period ending June 30 preceding the fiscal year for which fees are being established;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the total percentage change for the previous fiscal year in basic pay under the General Schedule in accordance with section 5332 of title 5, as adjusted by any locality-based comparability payment pursuant to section 5304 of such title for Federal employees stationed in the District of Columbia; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the average annual change in the cost, per full-time equivalent position of the Food and Drug Administration, of all personnel compensation and benefits paid with respect to such positions for the first 5 fiscal years of the previous 6 fiscal years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The adjustment made each fiscal year by this subsection shall be added on a compounded basis to the sum of all adjustments made each fiscal year after fiscal year 2008 under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Workload adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Beginning with fiscal year 2009, after the fee revenues established in subsection (b) are adjusted for a fiscal year for inflation in accordance with paragraph (1), the fee revenues shall be adjusted further for such fiscal year to reflect changes in the workload of the Secretary with respect to the submission of DTC advertisements for advisory review prior to initial dissemination. With respect to such adjustment:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The adjustment shall be determined by the Secretary based upon the number of DTC advertisements identified pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(C) for the upcoming fiscal year, excluding allowable previously paid carry over submissions. The adjustment shall be determined by multiplying the number of such advertisements projected for that fiscal year that exceeds 150 by $27,600 (adjusted each year beginning with fiscal year 2009 for inflation in accordance with paragraph (1)). The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register the fee revenues and fees resulting from the adjustment and the supporting methodologies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Under no circumstances shall the adjustment result in fee revenues for a fiscal year that are less than the fee revenues established for the prior fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Annual fee setting for advisory review</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than August 1 of each fiscal year (or, with respect to fiscal year 2008, not later than 90 days after September 27, 2007), the Secretary shall establish for the next fiscal year the DTC advertisement advisory review fee under subsection (a)(1), based on the revenue amounts established under subsection (b), the adjustments provided under paragraphs (1) and (2), and the number of DTC advertisements identified pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(C), excluding allowable previously-paid carry over submissions. The annual advisory review fee shall be established by dividing the fee revenue for a fiscal year (as adjusted pursuant to this subsection) by the number of DTC advertisements so identified, excluding allowable previously-paid carry over submissions under subsection (a)(1)(F)(i).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Fiscal year 2008 fee limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subsection (b) and the adjustments pursuant to this subsection, the fee established under subparagraph (A) for fiscal year 2008 may not be more than $83,000 per submission for advisory review.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Annual fee limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subsection (b) and the adjustments pursuant to this subsection, the fee established under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year after fiscal year 2008 may not be more than 50 percent more than the fee established for the prior fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The total amount of fees obligated for a fiscal year may not exceed the total costs for such fiscal year for the resources allocated for the process for the advisory review of prescription drug advertising.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:323 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Operating reserves</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish in the Food and Drug Administration salaries and expenses appropriation account without fiscal year limitation a Direct-to-Consumer Advisory Review Operating Reserve, of at least $6,250,000 in fiscal year 2008, to continue the program under this section in the event the fees collected in any subsequent fiscal year pursuant to subsection (a)(1) do not generate the fee revenue amount established for that fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Fee setting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish the operating reserve fee under subsection (a)(2)(A) for each person required to pay the fee by multiplying the number of DTC advertisements identified by that person pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(C) by the advisory review fee established pursuant to subsection (c)(3) for that fiscal year, except that in no case shall the operating reserve fee assessed be less than the operating reserve fee assessed if the person had first participated in the program under this section in fiscal year 2008.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Use of operating reserve</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may use funds from the reserves only to the extent necessary in any fiscal year to make up the difference between the fee revenue amount established for that fiscal year under subsections (b) and (c) and the amount of fees actually collected for that fiscal year pursuant to subsection (a)(1), or to pay costs of ending the program under this section if it is terminated pursuant to subsection (f) or not reauthorized beyond fiscal year 2012.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Refund of operating reserves</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 120 days after the end of fiscal year 2012, or if the program under this section ends early pursuant to subsection (f), the Secretary, after setting aside sufficient operating reserve amounts to terminate the program under this section, shall refund all amounts remaining in the operating reserve on a pro rata basis to each person that paid an operating reserve fee assessment. In no event shall the refund to any person exceed the total amount of operating reserve fees paid by such person pursuant to subsection (a)(2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect of failure to pay fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other requirement, a submission for advisory review of a DTC advertisement submitted by a person subject to fees under subsection (a) shall be considered incomplete and shall not be accepted for review by the Secretary until all fees owed by such person under this section have been paid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Effect of inadequate funding of program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Initial funding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If on November 1, 2007, or 120 days after September 27, 2007, whichever is later, the Secretary has not received at least $11,250,000 in advisory review fees and operating reserve fees combined, the program under this section shall not commence and all collected fees shall be refunded.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Later fiscal years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Beginning in fiscal year 2009, if, on November 1 of the fiscal year, the combination of the operating reserves, annual fee revenues from that fiscal year, and unobligated fee revenues from prior fiscal years falls below $9,000,000, adjusted for inflation (as described in subsection (c)(1)), the program under this section shall terminate, and the Secretary shall notify all participants, retain any money from the unused advisory review fees and the operating reserves needed to terminate the program, and refund the remainder of the unused fees and operating reserves. To the extent required to terminate the program, the Secretary shall first use unobligated advisory review fee revenues from prior fiscal years, then the operating reserves, and finally, unused advisory review fees from the relevant fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Crediting and availability of fees</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Fees authorized under subsection (a) shall be collected and available for obligation only to the extent and in the amount provided in advance in appropriations Acts. Such fees are authorized to remain available until expended. Such sums as may be necessary may be transferred from the Food and Drug Administration salaries and expenses appropriation account without fiscal year limitation to such appropriation account for salaries and expenses with such fiscal year limitation. The sums transferred shall be available solely for the process for the advisory review of prescription drug advertising.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Collections and appropriation acts</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The fees authorized by this section&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Offset</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any amount of fees collected for a fiscal year under this section that exceeds the amount of fees specified in appropriation Acts for such fiscal year shall be credited to the appropriation account of the Food and Drug Administration as provided in paragraph (1), and shall be subtracted from the amount of fees that would otherwise be collected under this section pursuant to appropriation Acts for a subsequent fiscal year.</p>
