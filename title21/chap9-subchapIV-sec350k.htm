<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Recognition of laboratory accreditation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 2 years after January 4, 2011, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) establish a program for the testing of food by accredited laboratories;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establish a publicly available registry of accreditation bodies recognized by the Secretary and laboratories accredited by a recognized accreditation body, including the name of, contact information for, and other information deemed appropriate by the Secretary about such bodies and laboratories; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) require, as a condition of recognition or accreditation, as appropriate, that recognized accreditation bodies and accredited laboratories report to the Secretary any changes that would affect the recognition of such accreditation body or the accreditation of such laboratory.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Program requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The program established under paragraph (1)(A) shall provide for the recognition of laboratory accreditation bodies that meet criteria established by the Secretary for accreditation of laboratories, including independent private laboratories and laboratories run and operated by a Federal agency (including the Department of Commerce), State, or locality with a demonstrated capability to conduct 1 or more sampling and analytical testing methodologies for food.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Increasing the number of qualified laboratories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall work with the laboratory accreditation bodies recognized under paragraph (1), as appropriate, to increase the number of qualified laboratories that are eligible to perform testing under subparagraph&nbsp;<sup><a href="#350k_1_target" name="350k_1">1</a></sup> (b) beyond the number so qualified on January 4, 2011.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Limited distribution</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Foreign laboratories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Accreditation bodies recognized by the Secretary under paragraph (1) may accredit laboratories that operate outside the United States, so long as such laboratories meet the accreditation standards applicable to domestic laboratories accredited under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Model laboratory standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall develop model standards that a laboratory shall meet to be accredited by a recognized accreditation body for a specified sampling or analytical testing methodology and included in the registry provided for <!-- PDFPage:138 -->under paragraph (1). In developing the model standards, the Secretary shall consult existing standards for guidance. The model standards shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) methods to ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) appropriate sampling, analytical procedures (including rapid analytical procedures), and commercially available techniques are followed and reports of analyses are certified as true and accurate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) internal quality systems are established and maintained;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) procedures exist to evaluate and respond promptly to complaints regarding analyses and other activities for which the laboratory is accredited; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any other criteria determined appropriate by the Secretary.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Testing procedures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 30 months after January 4, 2011, food testing shall be conducted by Federal laboratories or non-Federal laboratories that have been accredited for the appropriate sampling or analytical testing methodology or methodologies by a recognized accreditation body on the registry established by the Secretary under subsection (a)(1)(B) whenever such testing is conducted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by or on behalf of an owner or consignee&mdash;</p>
