<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized, in his discretion, to establish and maintain an international animal quarantine station within the territory of the United States. The quarantine station shall be located on an island selected by the Secretary of Agriculture where, in his judgment, maximum animal disease and pest security measures can be maintained. The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to acquire land or any interest therein, by purchase, donation, exchange, or otherwise and construct or lease buildings, improvements, and other facilities as may be necessary for the establishment and maintenance of such quarantine station. The Secretary of Agriculture, on behalf of the United States, is authorized to accept any gift or donation of money, personal property, buildings, improvements, and other facilities for the purpose of conducting the functions authorized under sections 135 to 135b of this title. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to prevent the introduction or dissemination of livestock or poultry disease or pests, animals may be brought into the quarantine station from any country, including but not limited to those countries in which the Secretary of Agriculture determines that rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease exists, and subsequently moved into other parts of the United States in accordance with such conditions as the Secretary of Agriculture shall determine are adequate in order to prevent the introduction into and the dissemination within the United States of livestock or poultry diseases or pests. The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to cooperate in such manner as he deems appropriate, with other countries or with breeders&rsquo; organizations or similar organizations or with individuals regarding importation of animals into and through the quarantine station and to charge and collect reasonable fees for use of the facilities of such station from importers. Such fees shall be deposited into the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the appropriation charged with the operating expenses of the quarantine station. The Secretary is authorized to issue such regulations as he deems necessary to carry out the provisions of sections 135 to 135b of this title.</p>
