<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) notice of the actual number of communication interceptions, pen registers, and <!-- PDFPage:340 -->trap and trace devices, representing a portion of the maximum capacity set forth under subparagraph (B), that the Attorney General estimates that government agencies authorized to conduct electronic surveillance may conduct and use simultaneously by the date that is 4 years after October 25, 1994; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) notice of the maximum capacity required to accommodate all of the communication interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices that the Attorney General estimates that government agencies authorized to conduct electronic surveillance may conduct and use simultaneously after the date that is 4 years after October 25, 1994.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Basis of notices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The notices issued under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall identify, to the maximum extent practicable, the capacity required at specific geographic locations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compliance with capacity notices</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Initial capacity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 3 years after the publication by the Attorney General of a notice of capacity requirements or within 4 years after October 25, 1994, whichever is longer, a telecommunications carrier shall, subject to subsection (e) of this section, ensure that its systems are capable of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) accommodating simultaneously the number of interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices set forth in the notice under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) expanding to the maximum capacity set forth in the notice under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Expansion to maximum capacity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the date described in paragraph (1), a telecommunications carrier shall, subject to subsection (e) of this section, ensure that it can accommodate expeditiously any increase in the actual number of communication interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices that authorized agencies may seek to conduct and use, up to the maximum capacity requirement set forth in the notice under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notices of increased maximum capacity requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall periodically publish in the Federal Register, after notice and comment, notice of any necessary increases in the maximum capacity requirement set forth in the notice under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 3 years after notice of increased maximum capacity requirements is published under paragraph (1), or within such longer time period as the Attorney General may specify, a telecommunications carrier shall, subject to subsection (e) of this section, ensure that its systems are capable of expanding to the increased maximum capacity set forth in the notice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Carrier statement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 180 days after the publication by the Attorney General of a notice of capacity requirements pursuant to subsection (a) or (c) of this section, a telecommunications carrier shall submit to the Attorney General a statement identifying any of its systems or services that do not have the capacity to accommodate simultaneously the number of interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices set forth in the notice under such subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reimbursement required for compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General shall review the statements submitted under subsection (d) of this section and may, subject to the availability of appropriations, agree to reimburse a telecommunications carrier for costs directly associated with modifications to attain such capacity requirement that are determined to be reasonable in accordance with section 1008(e) of this title. Until the Attorney General agrees to reimburse such carrier for such modification, such carrier shall be considered to be in compliance with the capacity notices under subsection (a) or (c) of this section.</p>
