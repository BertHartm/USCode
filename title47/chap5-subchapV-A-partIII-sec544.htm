<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Cable service unprotected by Constitution; blockage of premium channel upon request</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as prohibiting a franchising authority and a cable operator from specifying, in a franchise or renewal thereof, that certain cable services shall not be provided or shall be provided subject to conditions, if such cable services are obscene or are otherwise unprotected by the Constitution of the United States.</p>

No State or franchising authority may prohibit, condition, or restrict a cable system's use of any type of subscriber equipment or any transmission technology.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation on regulatory powers of Federal agencies, States, or franchising authorities; exceptions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any rule, regulation, or order under title 17.</p>
