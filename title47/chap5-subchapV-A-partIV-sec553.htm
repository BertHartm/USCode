<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of all penalties and remedies established for violations of subsection (a)(1) of this section, the prohibited activity established herein as it applies to each such device shall be deemed a separate violation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The court may&mdash;</p>
