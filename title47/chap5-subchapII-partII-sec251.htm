<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Interconnection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The duty to provide, for the facilities and equipment of any requesting telecommunications carrier, interconnection with the local exchange carrier's network&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for the transmission and routing of telephone exchange service and exchange access;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) at any technically feasible point within the carrier's network;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) that is at least equal in quality to that provided by the local exchange carrier to itself or to any subsidiary, affiliate, or any other party to which the carrier provides interconnection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) on rates, terms, and conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement and the requirements of this section and section 252 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Unbundled access</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The duty to provide, to any requesting telecommunications carrier for the provision of a telecommunications service, nondiscriminatory access to network elements on an unbundled basis at any technically feasible point on rates, terms, and conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement and the requirements of this section and section 252 of this title.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Notice of changes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The duty to provide reasonable public notice of changes in the information necessary for the transmission and routing of services using that local exchange carrier's facilities or networks, as well as of any other changes that would affect the interoperability of those facilities and networks.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Access standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining what network elements should be made available for purposes of subsection (c)(3) of this section, the Commission shall consider, at a minimum, whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) access to such network elements as are proprietary in nature is necessary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the failure to provide access to such network elements would impair the ability of the telecommunications carrier seeking access to provide the services that it seeks to offer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Preservation of State access regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In prescribing and enforcing regulations to implement the requirements of this section, the Commission shall not preclude the enforcement of any regulation, order, or policy of a State commission that&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Exemption for certain rural telephone companies</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subsection (c) of this section shall not apply to a rural telephone company until (i) such company has received a bona fide request for interconnection, services, or network elements, and (ii) the State commission determines (under subparagraph (B)) that such request is not unduly economically burdensome, is technically feasible, and is consistent with section 254 of this title (other than subsections (b)(7) and (c)(1)(D) thereof).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) State termination of exemption and implementation schedule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The party making a bona fide request of a rural telephone company for interconnection, services, or network elements shall submit a notice of its request to the State commission. The State commission shall conduct an inquiry for the purpose of determining whether to terminate the exemption under subparagraph (A). Within 120 days after the State commission receives notice of the request, the State commission shall terminate the exemption if the request is not unduly economically burdensome, is technically feasible, and is consistent with section 254 of this title (other than subsections (b)(7) and (c)(1)(D) thereof). Upon termination of the exemption, a State commission shall establish an implementation schedule for compliance with the request that is consistent in time and manner with Commission regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitation on exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The exemption provided by this paragraph shall not apply with respect to a request under subsection (c) of this section from a cable operator providing video programming, and seeking to provide any telecommunications service, in the area in which the rural telephone company provides video programming. The limitation contained in this subparagraph shall not apply to a rural telephone company that is providing video programming on February 8, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Suspensions and modifications for rural carriers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local exchange carrier with fewer than 2 percent of the Nation's subscriber lines installed in the aggregate nationwide may petition a State commission for a suspension or modification of the application of a requirement or requirements of subsection (b) or (c) of this section to telephone exchange service facilities specified in such petition. The State commission shall grant such petition to the extent that, and for such duration as, the State commission determines that such suspension or modification&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to avoid a significant adverse economic impact on users of telecommunications services generally;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to avoid imposing a requirement that is unduly economically burdensome; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to avoid imposing a requirement that is technically infeasible; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The State commission shall act upon any petition filed under this paragraph within 180 days after receiving such petition. Pending such action, the State commission may suspend enforcement of the requirement or requirements to which the petition applies with respect to the petitioning carrier or carriers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Continued enforcement of exchange access and interconnection requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On and after February 8, 1996, each local exchange carrier, to the extent that it provides wireline services, shall provide exchange access, information access, and exchange services for such access to interexchange carriers and information service providers in accordance with the same equal access and nondiscriminatory interconnection restrictions and obligations (including receipt of compensation) that apply to such carrier on the date immediately preceding February 8, 1996, under any court order, consent decree, or regulation, order, or policy of the Commission, until such restrictions and obligations are explicitly superseded by regulations prescribed by the Commission after February 8, 1996. During the period beginning on February 8, 1996, and until such restrictions and obligations are so superseded, such restrictions and obligations shall be enforceable in the same manner as regulations of the Commission.</p>
