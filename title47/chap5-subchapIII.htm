<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) closed-captioned television will provide access to information, entertainment, and a greater understanding of our Nation and the world to over 24,000,000 people in the United States who are deaf or hearing-impaired;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) closed-captioned television will provide benefits for the nearly 38 percent of older Americans who have some loss of hearing;</p>

<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">We live in a time when the technology of telecommunications is undergoing rapid change which will dramatically affect the whole of our society. It has long been recognized that the executive branch of the Federal government should be better equipped to deal with the issues which arise from telecommunications growth. As the largest single user of the nation's telecommunications facilities, the Federal government must also manage its internal communications operations in the most effective manner possible.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, I am today transmitting to the Congress Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1970, prepared in accordance with chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">That plan would establish a new Office of Telecommunications Policy in the Executive Office of the President. The new unit would be headed by a Director and a Deputy Director who would be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The existing office held by the Director of Telecommunications Management in the Office of Emergency Preparedness would be abolished.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition to the functions which are transferred to it by the reorganization plan, the new Office would perform certain other duties which I intend to assign to it by Executive order as soon as the reorganization plan takes effect. That order would delegate to the new Office essentially those functions which are now assigned to the Director of Telecommunications Management. The Office of Telecommunications Policy would be assisted in its research and analysis responsibilities by the agencies and departments of the Executive Branch including another new office, located in the Department of Commerce.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new Office of Telecommunications Policy would play three essential roles:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. It would serve as the President's principal adviser on telecommunications policy, helping to formulate government policies concerning a wide range of domestic and international telecommunications issues and helping to develop plans and programs which take full advantage of the nation's technological capabilities. The speed of economic and technological advance in our time means that new questions concerning communications are constantly arising, questions on which the government must be well informed and well advised. The new Office will enable the President and all government officials to share more fully in the experience, the insights, and the forecasts of government and non-government experts.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The Office of Telecommunications Policy would help formulate policies and coordinate operations for the Federal government's own vast communications systems. It would, for example, set guidelines for the various departments and agencies concerning their communications equipment and services. It would regularly review the ability of government communications systems to meet the security needs of the nation and to perform effectively in time of emergency. The Office would direct the assignment of those portions of the radio spectrum which are reserved for government use, carry out responsibilities conferred on the President by the Communications Satellite Act, advise State and local governments, and provide policy direction for the National Communications System.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. Finally, the new Office would enable the executive branch to speak with a clearer vote and to act as a more effective partner in discussions of communications policy with both the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission. This action would take away none of the prerogatives or functions assigned to the Federal Communications Commission by the Congress. It is my hope, however, that the new Office and the Federal Communications Commission would cooperate in achieving certain reforms in telecommunications policy, especially in their procedures for allocating portions of the radio spectrum for government and civilian use. Our current procedures must be more flexible if they are to deal adequately with problems such as the worsening spectrum shortage.</p>
<p class="note-body">Each reorganization included in the plan which accompanies this message is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 901(a) of title 5 of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive to section 901(a)(1), &ldquo;to promote the better execution of the laws, the more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and the expeditious administration of the <!-- PDFPage:117 -->public business;&rdquo; and section 901(a)(3), &ldquo;to increase the efficiency of the operations of the government to the fullest extent practicable.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganization provided for in this plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers, as specified in sections 3(a) and 3(b) of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are comparable to those fixed for other officers in the executive branch who have similar responsibilities.</p>
<p class="note-body">This plan should result in the more efficient operation of the government. It is not practical, however, to itemize or aggregate the exact expenditure reductions which will result from this action.</p>
<p class="note-body">The public interest requires that government policies concerning telecommunications be formulated with as much sophistication and vision as possible. This reorganization plan&mdash;and the executive order which would follow it&mdash;are necessary instruments if the government is to respond adequately to the challenges and opportunities presented by the rapid pace of change in communications. I urge that the Congress allow this plan to become effective so that these necessary reforms can be accomplished.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allocation of facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In considering applications for licenses, and modifications and renewals thereof, when and insofar as there is demand for the same, the Commission shall make such distribution of licenses, frequencies, hours of operation, and of power among the several States and communities as to provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of radio service to each of the same.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Terms of licenses</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Initial and renewal licenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each license granted for the operation of a broadcasting station shall be for a term of not to exceed 8 years. Upon application therefor, a renewal of such license may be granted from time to time for a term of not to exceed 8 years from the date of expiration of the preceding license, if the Commission finds that public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served thereby. Consistent with the foregoing provisions of this subsection, the Commission may by rule prescribe the period or periods for which licenses shall be granted and renewed for particular classes of stations, but the Commission may not adopt or follow any rule which would preclude it, in any case involving a station of a particular class, from granting or renewing a license for a shorter period than that prescribed for stations of such class if, in its judgment, the public interest, convenience, or necessity would be served by such action.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Materials in application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to expedite action on applications for renewal of broadcasting station licenses and in order to avoid needless expense to applicants for such renewals, the Commission shall not require any such applicant to file any information which previously has been furnished to the Commission or which is not directly material to the considerations that affect the granting or denial of such application, but the Commission may require any new or additional facts it deems necessary to make its findings.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Continuation pending decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Pending any administrative or judicial hearing and final decision on such an application and the disposition of any petition for rehearing pursuant to section 405 or section 402 of this title, the Commission shall continue such license in effect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Renewals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No renewal of an existing station license in the broadcast or the common carrier services shall be granted more than thirty days prior to the expiration of the original license.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Operation of certain radio stations without individual licenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any license requirement established in this chapter, if the Commission determines that such authorization serves the public interest, convenience, and necessity, the Commission may by rule authorize the operation of radio stations without individual licenses in the following radio services: (A) the citizens band radio service; (B) the radio control service; (C) the aviation radio service for aircraft stations operated on domestic flights when <!-- PDFPage:121 -->such aircraft are not otherwise required to carry a radio station; and (D) the maritime radio service for ship stations navigated on domestic voyages when such ships are not otherwise required to carry a radio station.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any radio station operator who is authorized by the Commission to operate without an individual license shall comply with all other provisions of this chapter and with rules prescribed by the Commission under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, the terms &ldquo;citizens band radio service&rdquo;, &ldquo;radio control service&rdquo;, &ldquo;aircraft station&rdquo; and &ldquo;ship station&rdquo; shall have the meanings given them by the Commission by rule.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Areas in Alaska without access to over the air broadcasts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, (1) any holder of a broadcast license may broadcast to an area of Alaska that otherwise does not have access to over the air broadcasts via translator, microwave, or other alternative signal delivery even if another holder of a broadcast license begins broadcasting to such area, (2) any holder of a broadcast license who has broadcast to an area of Alaska that did not have access to over the air broadcasts via translator, microwave, or other alternative signal delivery may continue providing such service even if another holder of a broadcast license begins broadcasting to such area, and shall not be fined or subject to any other penalty, forfeiture, or revocation related to providing such service including any fine, penalty, forfeiture, or revocation for continuing to operate notwithstanding orders to the contrary.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Petition to deny application; time; contents; reply; findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any party in interest may file with the Commission a petition to deny any application (whether as originally filed or as amended) to which subsection (b) of this section applies at any time prior to the day of Commission grant thereof without hearing or the day of formal designation thereof for hearing; except that with respect to any classification of applications, the Commission from time to time by rule may specify a shorter period (no less than thirty days following the issuance of public notice by the Commission of the acceptance for filing of such application or of any substantial amendment thereof), which shorter period shall be reasonably related to the time when the applications would normally be reached for processing. The petitioner shall serve a copy of such petition on the applicant. The petition shall contain specific allegations of fact sufficient to show that the petitioner is a party in interest and that a grant of the application would be prima facie inconsistent with subsection (a) of this section (or subsection (k) of this section in the case of renewal of any broadcast station license). Such allegations of fact shall, except for those of which official notice may be taken, be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof. The applicant shall be given the opportunity to file a reply in which allegations of fact or denials thereof shall similarly be supported by affidavit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Commission finds on the basis of the application, the pleadings filed, or other matters which it may officially notice that there are no substantial and material questions of fact and that a grant of the application would be consistent with subsection (a) of this section (or subsection (k) of this section in the case of renewal of any broadcast station license), it shall make the grant, deny the petition, and issue a concise statement of the reasons for denying the petition, which statement shall dispose of all substantial issues raised by the petition. If a substantial and material question of fact is presented or if the Commission for any reason is unable to find that grant of the application would be consistent with subsection (a) of this section (or subsection (k) of this section in the case of renewal of any broadcast station license), it shall proceed as provided in subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Hearings; intervention; evidence; burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, in the case of any application to which subsection (a) of this section applies, a substantial and material question of fact is presented or the Commission for any reason is unable to make the finding specified in such subsection, it shall formally designate the application for hearing on the ground or reasons then obtaining and shall forthwith notify the applicant and all other known parties in interest of such action and the grounds and reasons therefor, specifying with particularity the matters and things in issue but not including issues or requirements phrased generally. When the Commission has so designated an application for hearing the parties in interest, if any, who are not notified by the Commission of such action may acquire the status of a party to the proceeding thereon by filing a petition for intervention showing the basis for their interest not more than thirty days after publication of the hearing issues or any substantial amendment thereto in the Federal Register. Any hearing subsequently held upon such application shall be a full hearing in which the applicant and all other parties in interest shall be permitted to participate. The burden of proceeding with the introduction of evidence and the burden of proof shall be upon the applicant, except that with respect to any issue presented by a petition to deny or a petition to enlarge the issues, such burdens shall be as determined by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Temporary authorization of temporary operations under subsection (b)</h4>

The Commission shall seek to design and test multiple alternative methodologies under appropriate circumstances. The Commission shall, directly or by contract, provide for the design and conduct (for purposes of testing) of competitive bidding using a contingent combinatorial bidding system that permits prospective bidders to bid on combinations or groups of licenses in a single bid and to enter multiple alternative bids within a single bidding round. In identifying classes of licenses and permits to be issued by competitive bidding, in specifying eligibility and other characteristics of such licenses and permits, and in designing the methodologies for use under this subsection, the Commission shall include safeguards to protect the public interest in the use of the spectrum and shall seek to promote the purposes specified in section 151 of this title and the following objectives:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services, and, for such purposes, consider the use of tax certificates, bidding preferences, and other procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) require such transfer disclosures and antitrafficking restrictions and payment schedules as may be necessary to prevent unjust enrichment as a result of the methods employed to issue licenses and permits; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) prescribe methods by which a reasonable reserve price will be required, or a minimum bid will be established, to obtain any license or permit being assigned pursuant to the competitive bidding, unless the Commission determines that such a reserve price or minimum bid is not in the public interest.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The study being conducted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration in consultation with the Department of Defense to determine whether the Department of Defense can share or relinquish additional spectrum for third generation wireless and other advanced communications services will not be completed until after the June 19th auction date for the upper 700 megahertz band, and long after the applications must be filed to participate in the auction, thereby creating further uncertainty as to whether the frequencies in the 700 megahertz band will be put to their highest and best use for the benefit of consumers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The Federal Communications Commission is also in the process of determining how to resolve the interference problems that exist in the 800 megahertz band, especially for public safety. One option being considered for the 800 megahertz band would involve the 700 megahertz band. The Commission should not hold the 700 megahertz auction before the 800 megahertz interference issues are resolved or a tenable plan has been conceived.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The 700 megahertz band is currently occupied by television broadcasters, and will be so until the transfer to digital television is completed. This situation creates a tremendous amount of uncertainty concerning when the spectrum will be available and reduces the value placed on the spectrum by potential bidders. The encumbrance of the 700 megahertz band reduces both the amount of money that the auction would be likely to produce and the probability that the spectrum would be purchased by the entities that valued the spectrum the most and would put the spectrum to its most productive use.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The Commission's rules governing voluntary mechanisms for vacating the 700 megahertz band by broadcast stations&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) produced no certainty that the band would be available for advanced mobile communications services, public safety operations, or other wireless services any earlier than the existing statutory framework provides; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) should advance the transition of digital television and must not result in the unjust enrichment of any incumbent licensee.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Service of complaints on satellite carriers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of any proceeding under this subsection, any satellite carrier that retransmits the signal of any broadcast station shall be deemed to designate the Secretary of the Commission as its agent for service of process. A television broadcast station may serve a satellite carrier with a complaint concerning an alleged violation of subsection (b)(1) of this section through retransmission of a station within the local market of such station by filing the original and two copies of the complaint with the Secretary of the Commission and serving a copy of the complaint on the satellite carrier by means of two commonly used overnight delivery services, each addressed to the chief executive officer of the satellite carrier at its principal place of business, and each marked &ldquo;URGENT LITIGATION MATTER&rdquo; on the outer packaging. Service shall be deemed complete one business day after a copy of the complaint is provided to the delivery services for overnight delivery. On receipt of a complaint filed by a television broadcast station under this subsection, the Secretary of the Commission shall send the original complaint by United States mail, postage prepaid, receipt requested, addressed to the chief executive officer of the satellite carrier at its principal place of business.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The defenses under this paragraph are the exclusive defenses available to a satellite carrier against which a complaint under this subsection is filed.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Defenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The defenses referred to under subparagraph (A) are the defenses that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the satellite carrier did not retransmit the television broadcast station to any person in the local market of the station during the time period specified in the complaint;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the television broadcast station had, in a writing signed by an officer of the television broadcast station, expressly authorized the retransmission of the station by the satellite carrier to each person in the local market of the television broadcast station to which the satellite carrier made such retransmissions for the entire time period during which it is alleged that a violation of subsection (b)(1) of this section has occurred;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the retransmission was made after January 1, 2002, and the television broadcast station had elected to assert the right to carriage under section 338 of this title as against the satellite carrier for the relevant period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the station being retransmitted is a noncommercial television broadcast station.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Counting of violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The retransmission without consent of a particular television broadcast station on a particular day to one or more persons in the local market of the station shall be considered a separate violation of subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to each alleged violation, the burden of proof shall be on a television broadcast station to establish that the satellite carrier retransmitted the station to at least one person in the local market of the station on the day in question. The burden of proof shall be on the satellite carrier with respect to all defenses other than the defense under paragraph (4)(B)(i).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Procedures</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 60 days after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall issue procedural regulations implementing this subsection which shall supersede procedures under section 312 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determinations</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Within 45 days after the filing of a complaint, the Commission shall issue a final determination in any proceeding brought under this subsection. The Commission's final determination shall specify the number of violations committed by the satellite carrier. The Commission shall hear witnesses only if it clearly appears, based on written filings by the parties, that there is a genuine dispute about material facts. Except as provided in the preceding <!-- PDFPage:149 -->sentence, the Commission may issue a final ruling based on written filings by the parties.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Discovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Commission may direct the parties to exchange pertinent documents, and if necessary to take prehearing depositions, on such schedule as the Commission may approve, but only if the Commission first determines that such discovery is necessary to resolve a genuine dispute about material facts, consistent with the obligation to make a final determination within 45 days.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission determines that a satellite carrier has retransmitted the television broadcast station to at least one person in the local market of such station and has failed to meet its burden of proving one of the defenses under paragraph (4) with respect to such retransmission, the Commission shall be required to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) make a finding that the satellite carrier violated subsection (b)(1) of this section with respect to that station; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) issue an order, within 45 days after the filing of the complaint, containing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a cease-and-desist order directing the satellite carrier immediately to stop making any further retransmissions of the television broadcast station to any person within the local market of such station until such time as the Commission determines that the satellite carrier is in compliance with subsection (b)(1) of this section with respect to such station;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the satellite carrier is found to have violated subsection (b)(1) of this section with respect to more than two television broadcast stations, a cease-and-desist order directing the satellite carrier to stop making any further retransmission of any television broadcast station to any person within the local market of such station, until such time as the Commission, after giving notice to the station, that the satellite carrier is in compliance with subsection (b)(1) of this section with respect to such stations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) an award to the complainant of that complainant's costs and reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Court proceedings on enforcement of Commission order</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">On entry by the Commission of a final order granting relief under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a television broadcast station may apply within 30 days after such entry to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia for a final judgment enforcing all relief granted by the Commission; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the satellite carrier may apply within 30 days after such entry to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia for a judgment reversing the Commission's order.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The procedure for an appeal under this paragraph by the satellite carrier shall supersede any other appeal rights under Federal or State law. A United States district court shall be deemed to have personal jurisdiction over the satellite carrier if the carrier, or a company under common control with the satellite carrier, has delivered television programming by satellite to more than 30 customers in that district during the preceding 4-year period. If the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia does not have personal jurisdiction over the satellite carrier, an enforcement action or appeal shall be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which may find personal jurisdiction based on the satellite carrier's ownership of licenses issued by the Commission. An application by a television broadcast station for an order enforcing any cease-and-desist relief granted by the Commission shall be resolved on a highly expedited schedule. No discovery may be conducted by the parties in any such proceeding. The district court shall enforce the Commission order unless the Commission record reflects manifest error and an abuse of discretion by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Civil action for statutory damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 6 months after issuance of an order by the Commission under this subsection, a television broadcast station may file a civil action in any United States district court that has personal jurisdiction over the satellite carrier for an award of statutory damages for any violation that the Commission has determined to have been committed by a satellite carrier under this subsection. Such action shall not be subject to transfer under section 1404(a) of title 28. On finding that the satellite carrier has committed one or more violations of subsection (b) of this section, the District Court shall be required to award the television broadcast station statutory damages of $25,000 per violation, in accordance with paragraph (5), and the costs and attorney's fees incurred by the station. Such statutory damages shall be awarded only if the television broadcast station has filed a binding stipulation with the court that such station will donate the full amount in excess of $1,000 of any statutory damage award to the United States Treasury for public purposes. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a station shall incur no tax liability of any kind with respect to any amounts so donated. Discovery may be conducted by the parties in any proceeding under this paragraph only if and to the extent necessary to resolve a genuinely disputed issue of fact concerning one of the defenses under paragraph (4). In any such action, the defenses under paragraph (4) shall be exclusive, and the burden of proof shall be on the satellite carrier with respect to all defenses other than the defense under paragraph (4)(B)(i).

<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the policy of the Commission, in any case in which the licensee of an existing AM daytime-only station located in a community with a population of more than 100,000 persons that lacks a local full-time aural station licensed to that community and that is located within a Class I station primary service area notifies the Commission that such licensee seeks to provide full-time service, to ensure that such a licensee is able to place a principal community contour signal over its entire community of license 24 hours a day, if technically feasible. The Commission shall report to the appropriate committees of Congress within 30 days after December 20, 1991, on how it intends to meet this policy goal.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;332. Mobile services</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Factors which Commission must consider</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In taking actions to manage the spectrum to be made available for use by the private mobile services, the Commission shall consider, consistent with section 151 of this title, whether such actions will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) promote the safety of life and property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) improve the efficiency of spectrum use and reduce the regulatory burden upon spectrum users, based upon sound engineering principles, user operational requirements, and marketplace demands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) encourage competition and provide services to the largest feasible number of users; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) increase interservice sharing opportunities between private mobile services and other services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Advisory coordinating committees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission, in coordinating the assignment of frequencies to stations in the private mobile services and in the fixed services (as defined by the Commission by rule), shall have authority to utilize assistance furnished by advisory coordinating committees consisting of individuals who are not officers or employees of the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The authority of the Commission established in this subsection shall not be subject to or affected by the provisions of part III of title 5 or section 1342 of title 31.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any person who provides assistance to the Commission under this subsection shall not be considered, by reason of having provided such assistance, a Federal employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any advisory coordinating committee which furnishes assistance to the Commission under this subsection shall not be subject to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Regulatory treatment of mobile services</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Common carrier treatment of commercial mobile services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A person engaged in the provision of a service that is a commercial mobile service shall, insofar as such person is so engaged, be treated as a common carrier for purposes of this chapter, except for such provisions of subchapter II of this chapter as the Commission may specify by regulation as inapplicable to that service or person. In prescribing or amending any such regulation, the Commission may not specify any provision of section 201, 202, or 208 of this title, and may specify any other provision only if the Commission determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) enforcement of such provision is not necessary in order to ensure that the charges, practices, classifications, or regulations for or in connection with that service are just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) enforcement of such provision is not necessary for the protection of consumers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) specifying such provision is consistent with the public interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Upon reasonable request of any person providing commercial mobile service, the Commission shall order a common carrier to establish physical connections with such service pursuant to the provisions of section 201 of this title. Except to the extent that the Commission is required to respond to such a request, this subparagraph shall not be construed as a limitation or expansion of the Commission's authority to order interconnection pursuant to this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Commission shall review competitive market conditions with respect to commercial mobile services and shall include in its annual report an analysis of those conditions. Such analysis shall include an identification of the number of competitors in various commercial mobile services, an analysis of whether or not there is effective competition, an analysis of whether any of such competitors have a dominant share of the market for such services, and a statement of whether additional providers or classes of providers in those services would be likely to enhance competition. As a part of making a determination with respect to the public interest under subparagraph (A)(iii), the Commission shall consider whether the proposed regulation (or amendment thereof) will promote competitive market conditions, including the extent to which such regulation (or amendment) will enhance competition among providers of commercial mobile services. If the Commission determines that such regulation (or amendment) will promote competition among providers of commercial mobile services, such determination may be the basis for a Commission finding that such regulation (or amendment) is in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The Commission shall, not later than 180 days after August 10, 1993, complete a rulemaking required to implement this paragraph with respect to the licensing of personal com<!-- PDFPage:154 -->munications services, including making any determinations required by subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Non-common carrier treatment of private mobile services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person engaged in the provision of a service that is a private mobile service shall not, insofar as such person is so engaged, be treated as a common carrier for any purpose under this chapter. A common carrier (other than a person that was treated as a provider of a private land mobile service prior to August 10, 1993) shall not provide any dispatch service on any frequency allocated for common carrier service, except to the extent such dispatch service is provided on stations licensed in the domestic public land mobile radio service before January 1, 1982. The Commission may by regulation terminate, in whole or in part, the prohibition contained in the preceding sentence if the Commission determines that such termination will serve the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) State preemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Notwithstanding sections 152(b) and 221(b) of this title, no State or local government shall have any authority to regulate the entry of or the rates charged by any commercial mobile service or any private mobile service, except that this paragraph shall not prohibit a State from regulating the other terms and conditions of commercial mobile services. Nothing in this subparagraph shall exempt providers of commercial mobile services (where such services are a substitute for land line telephone exchange service for a substantial portion of the communications within such State) from requirements imposed by a State commission on all providers of telecommunications services necessary to ensure the universal availability of telecommunications service at affordable rates. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this subparagraph, a State may petition the Commission for authority to regulate the rates for any commercial mobile service and the Commission shall grant such petition if such State demonstrates that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) market conditions with respect to such services fail to protect subscribers adequately from unjust and unreasonable rates or rates that are unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such market conditions exist and such service is a replacement for land line telephone exchange service for a substantial portion of the telephone land line exchange service within such State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Commission shall provide reasonable opportunity for public comment in response to such petition, and shall, within 9 months after the date of its submission, grant or deny such petition. If the Commission grants such petition, the Commission shall authorize the State to exercise under State law such authority over rates, for such periods of time, as the Commission deems necessary to ensure that such rates are just and reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If a State has in effect on June 1, 1993, any regulation concerning the rates for any commercial mobile service offered in such State on such date, such State may, no later than 1 year after August 10, 1993, petition the Commission requesting that the State be authorized to continue exercising authority over such rates. If a State files such a petition, the State's existing regulation shall, notwithstanding subparagraph (A), remain in effect until the Commission completes all action (including any reconsideration) on such petition. The Commission shall review such petition in accordance with the procedures established in such subparagraph, shall complete all action (including any reconsideration) within 12 months after such petition is filed, and shall grant such petition if the State satisfies the showing required under subparagraph (A)(i) or (A)(ii). If the Commission grants such petition, the Commission shall authorize the State to exercise under State law such authority over rates, for such period of time, as the Commission deems necessary to ensure that such rates are just and reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. After a reasonable period of time, as determined by the Commission, has elapsed from the issuance of an order under subparagraph (A) or this subparagraph, any interested party may petition the Commission for an order that the exercise of authority by a State pursuant to such subparagraph is no longer necessary to ensure that the rates for commercial mobile services are just and reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. The Commission shall provide reasonable opportunity for public comment in response to such petition, and shall, within 9 months after the date of its submission, grant or deny such petition in whole or in part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Regulatory treatment of communications satellite corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to alter or affect the regulatory treatment required by title IV of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 [47 U.S.C. 741 et seq.] of the corporation authorized by title III of such Act [47 U.S.C. 731 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Space segment capacity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Commission from continuing to determine whether the provision of space segment capacity by satellite systems to providers of commercial mobile services shall be treated as common carriage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Foreign ownership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission, upon a petition for waiver filed within 6 months after August 10, 1993, may waive the application of section 310(b) of this title to any foreign ownership that lawfully existed before May 24, 1993, of any provider of a private land mobile service that will be treated as a common carrier as a result of the enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, but only upon the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The extent of foreign ownership interest shall not be increased above the extent which existed on May 24, 1993.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Such waiver shall not permit the subsequent transfer of ownership to any other <!-- PDFPage:155 -->person in violation of section 310(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Preservation of local zoning authority</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in this paragraph, nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority of a State or local government or instrumentality thereof over decisions regarding the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The regulation of the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities by any State or local government or instrumentality thereof&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) shall not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) A State or local government or instrumentality thereof shall act on any request for authorization to place, construct, or modify personal wireless service facilities within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed with such government or instrumentality, taking into account the nature and scope of such request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) Any decision by a State or local government or instrumentality thereof to deny a request to place, construct, or modify personal wireless service facilities shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) No State or local government or instrumentality thereof may regulate the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the Commission's regulations concerning such emissions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) Any person adversely affected by any final action or failure to act by a State or local government or any instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with this subparagraph may, within 30 days after such action or failure to act, commence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction. The court shall hear and decide such action on an expedited basis. Any person adversely affected by an act or failure to act by a State or local government or any instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with clause (iv) may petition the Commission for relief.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the term &ldquo;personal wireless services&rdquo; means commercial mobile services, unlicensed wireless services, and common carrier wireless exchange access services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the term &ldquo;personal wireless service facilities&rdquo; means facilities for the provision of personal wireless services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the term &ldquo;unlicensed wireless service&rdquo; means the offering of telecommunications services using duly authorized devices which do not require individual licenses, but does not mean the provision of direct-to-home satellite services (as defined in section 303(v) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Mobile services access</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person engaged in the provision of commercial mobile services, insofar as such person is so engaged, shall not be required to provide equal access to common carriers for the provision of telephone toll services. If the Commission determines that subscribers to such services are denied access to the provider of telephone toll services of the subscribers&rsquo; choice, and that such denial is contrary to the public interest, convenience, and necessity, then the Commission shall prescribe regulations to afford subscribers unblocked access to the provider of telephone toll services of the subscribers&rsquo; choice through the use of a carrier identification code assigned to such provider or other mechanism. The requirements for unblocking shall not apply to mobile satellite services unless the Commission finds it to be in the public interest to apply such requirements to such services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;commercial mobile service&rdquo; means any mobile service (as defined in section 153 of this title) that is provided for profit and makes interconnected service available (A) to the public or (B) to such classes of eligible users as to be effectively available to a substantial portion of the public, as specified by regulation by the Commission;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;interconnected service&rdquo; means service that is interconnected with the public switched network (as such terms are defined by regulation by the Commission) or service for which a request for interconnection is pending pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the term &ldquo;private mobile service&rdquo; means any mobile service (as defined in section 153 of this title) that is not a commercial mobile service or the functional equivalent of a commercial mobile service, as specified by regulation by the Commission.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Commission action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission determines to issue additional licenses for advanced television services, the Commission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) should limit the initial eligibility for such licenses to persons that, as of the date of such issuance, are licensed to operate a television broadcast station or hold a permit to construct such a station (or both); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall adopt regulations that allow the holders of such licenses to offer such ancillary or supplementary services on designated frequencies as may be consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Contents of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In prescribing the regulations required by subsection (a) of this section, the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) only permit such licensee or permittee to offer ancillary or supplementary services if the use of a designated frequency for such services is consistent with the technology or method designated by the Commission for the provision of advanced television services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) limit the broadcasting of ancillary or supplementary services on designated frequencies so as to avoid derogation of any advanced television services, including high defi<!-- PDFPage:158 -->nition television broadcasts, that the Commission may require using such frequencies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) apply to any other ancillary or supplementary service such of the Commission's regulations as are applicable to the offering of analogous services by any other person, except that no ancillary or supplementary service shall have any rights to carriage under section 534 or 535 of this title or be deemed a multichannel video programming distributor for purposes of section 548 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) adopt such technical and other requirements as may be necessary or appropriate to assure the quality of the signal used to provide advanced television services, and may adopt regulations that stipulate the minimum number of hours per day that such signal must be transmitted; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) prescribe such other regulations as may be necessary for the protection of the public interest, convenience, and necessity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Recovery of license</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission grants a license for advanced television services to a person that, as of the date of such issuance, is licensed to operate a television broadcast station or holds a permit to construct such a station (or both), the Commission shall, as a condition of such license, require that either the additional license or the original license held by the licensee be surrendered to the Commission for reallocation or reassignment (or both) pursuant to Commission regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Public interest requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed as relieving a television broadcasting station from its obligation to serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity. In the Commission's review of any application for renewal of a broadcast license for a television station that provides ancillary or supplementary services, the television licensee shall establish that all of its program services on the existing or advanced television spectrum are in the public interest. Any violation of the Commission rules applicable to ancillary or supplementary services shall reflect upon the licensee's qualifications for renewal of its license.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Fees</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Services to which fees apply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the regulations prescribed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section permit a licensee to offer ancillary or supplementary services on a designated frequency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for which the payment of a subscription fee is required in order to receive such services, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for which the licensee directly or indirectly receives compensation from a third party in return for transmitting material furnished by such third party (other than commercial advertisements used to support broadcasting for which a subscription fee is not required),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the Commission shall establish a program to assess and collect from the licensee for such designated frequency an annual fee or other schedule or method of payment that promotes the objectives described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Collection of fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The program required by paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be designed (i) to recover for the public a portion of the value of the public spectrum resource made available for such commercial use, and (ii) to avoid unjust enrichment through the method employed to permit such uses of that resource;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) recover for the public an amount that, to the extent feasible, equals but does not exceed (over the term of the license) the amount that would have been recovered had such services been licensed pursuant to the provisions of section 309(j) of this title and the Commission's regulations thereunder; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) be adjusted by the Commission from time to time in order to continue to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of revenues</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), all proceeds obtained pursuant to the regulations required by this subsection shall be deposited in the Treasury in accordance with chapter 33 of title 31.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Preservation of low-power community television broadcasting</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Creation of class A licenses</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Rulemaking required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 120 days after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall prescribe regulations to establish a class A television license to be available to licensees of qualifying low-power television stations. Such regulations shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the license shall be subject to the same license terms and renewal standards as the licenses for full-power television stations except as provided in this subsection; and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notice to and certification by licensees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 30 days after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall send a notice to the licensees of all low-power television licenses that describes the requirements for class A designation. Within 60 days after November 29, 1999, licensees intending to seek class A designation shall submit to the Commission a certification of eligibility based on the qualification requirements of this subsection. Absent a material deficiency, the Commission shall grant certification of eligibility to apply for class A status.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Application for and award of licenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Consistent with the requirements set forth in paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection, a licensee may submit an application for class A designation under this paragraph within 30 days after final regulations are adopted under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. Except as provided in paragraphs (6) and (7), the Commission shall, within 30 days after receipt of an application of a licensee of a qualifying low-power television station that is acceptable for filing, award such a class A television station license to such licensee.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Resolution of technical problems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall act to preserve the service areas of low-power television licensees pending the final resolution of a class A application. If, after granting certification of eligibility for a class A license, technical problems arise requiring an engineering solution to a full-power station's allotted parameters or channel assignment in the digital television Table of Allotments, the Commission shall make such modifications as necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to ensure replication of the full-power digital television applicant's service area, as provided for in sections 73.622 and 73.623 of the Commission's regulations (47 CFR 73.622, 73.623); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to permit maximization of a full-power digital television applicant's service area consistent with such sections 73.622 and 73.623,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">if such applicant has filed an application for maximization or a notice of its intent to seek such maximization by December 31, 1999, and filed a bona fide application for maximization by May 1, 2000. Any such applicant shall comply with all applicable Commission rules regarding the construction of digital television facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Change applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a station that is awarded a construction permit to maximize or significantly enhance its digital television service area, later files a change application to reduce its digital television service area, the protected contour of that station shall be reduced in accordance with such change modification.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Qualifying low-power television stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, a station is a qualifying low-power television station if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) during the 90 days preceding November 29, 1999&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) such station broadcast a minimum of 18 hours per day;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) such station broadcast an average of at least 3 hours per week of programming that was produced within the market area served by such station, or the market area served by a group of commonly controlled low-power stations that carry common local programming produced within the market area served by such group; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) such station was in compliance with the Commission's requirements applicable to low-power television stations; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) from and after the date of its application for a class A license, the station is in compliance with the Commission's operating rules for full-power television stations; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Commission determines that the public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served by treating the station as a qualifying low-power television station for purposes of this section, or for other reasons determined by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Common ownership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No low-power television station authorized as of November 29, 1999, shall be disqualified for a class A license based on common ownership with any other medium of mass communication.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Issuance of licenses for advanced television services to television translator stations and qualifying low-power television stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission is not required to issue any additional license for advanced television services to the licensee of a class A television station under this subsection, or to any licensee of any television translator station, but shall accept a license application for such services proposing facilities that will not cause interference to the service area of any other broadcast facility applied for, protected, permitted, or authorized on the date of filing of the advanced television application. Such new license or the original license of the applicant shall be forfeited after the end of the digital television service transition period, as determined by the Commission. A licensee of a low-power television station or television translator station may, at the option of licensee, elect to convert to the provision of advanced television services on its analog channel, but shall not be required to convert to digital operation until the end of such transition period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) No preemption of section 337</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection preempts or otherwise affects section 337 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Interim qualification</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Stations operating within certain bandwidth</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission may not grant a class A license to a low-power television station for <!-- PDFPage:160 -->operation between 698 and 806 megahertz, but the Commission shall provide to low-power television stations assigned to and temporarily operating in that bandwidth the opportunity to meet the qualification requirements for a class A license. If such a qualified applicant for a class A license is assigned a channel within the core spectrum (as such term is defined in MM Docket No. 87&ndash;286, February 17, 1998), the Commission shall issue a class A license simultaneously with the assignment of such channel.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certain channels off-limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission may not grant under this subsection a class A license to a low-power television station operating on a channel within the core spectrum that includes any of the 175 additional channels referenced in paragraph 45 of its February 23, 1998, Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration of the Sixth Report and Order (MM Docket No. 87&ndash;268). Within 18 months after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall identify by channel, location, and applicable technical parameters those 175 channels.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) No interference requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission may not grant a class A license, nor approve a modification of a class A license, unless the applicant or licensee shows that the class A station for which the license or modification is sought will not cause&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) interference within&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the predicted Grade B contour (as of the date of the enactment of the Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999 [November 29, 1999], or November 1, 1999, whichever is later, or as proposed in a change application filed on or before such date) of any television station transmitting in analog format; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii)(I) the digital television service areas provided in the DTV Table of Allotments; (II) the areas protected in the Commission's digital television regulations (47 CFR 73.622(e) and (f)); (III) the digital television service areas of stations subsequently granted by the Commission prior to the filing of a class A application; and (IV) stations seeking to maximize power under the Commission's rules, if such station has complied with the notification requirements in paragraph (1)(D);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) interference within the protected contour of any low-power television station or low-power television translator station that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) was licensed prior to the date on which the application for a class A license, or for the modification of such a license, was filed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) was authorized by construction permit prior to such date; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) had a pending application that was submitted prior to such date; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the 470&ndash;512 megahertz band identified in section 22.621 or 90.303 of such regulations; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the 482&ndash;488 megahertz band in New York.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Priority for displaced low-power stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Low-power stations that are displaced by an application filed under this section shall have priority over other low-power stations in the assignment of available channels.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Evaluation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 10 years after the date the Commission first issues additional licenses for advanced television services, the Commission shall conduct an evaluation of the advanced television services program. Such evaluation shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an assessment of the willingness of consumers to purchase the television receivers necessary to receive broadcasts of advanced television services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an assessment of alternative uses, including public safety use, of the frequencies used for such broadcasts; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the extent to which the Commission has been or will be able to reduce the amount of spectrum assigned to licensees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Provision of digital data service by low-power television stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 60 days after receiving a request (made in such form and manner and containing such information as the Commission may require) under this subsection from a low-power television station to which this subsection applies, the Commission shall authorize the licensee or permittee of that station to provide digital data service subject to the requirements of this subsection as a pilot project to demonstrate the feasibility of using low-power television stations to provide high-speed wireless digital data service, including Internet access to unserved areas.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;338. Carriage of local television signals by satellite carriers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Carriage obligations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each satellite carrier providing, under section 122 of title 17, secondary transmissions to subscribers located within the local market of a television broadcast station of a primary transmission made by that station shall carry upon request the signals of all television broadcast stations located within that local market, subject to section 325(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Remedies for failure to carry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to the remedies available to television broadcast stations under section 501(f) of title 17, the Commission may use the Commission's authority under this chapter to assure compliance with the obligations of this subsection, but in no instance shall a Commission enforcement proceeding be required as a predicate to the pursuit of a remedy available under such section 501(f).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#338_1_target" name="338_1">1</a></sup> Low power station carriage optional</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No low power television station whose signals are provided under section 119(a)(14) of title 17 shall be entitled to insist on carriage under this section, regardless of whether the satellite carrier provides secondary transmissions of the primary transmissions of other stations in the same local market pursuant to section 122 of such title, nor shall any such carriage be considered in connection with the requirements of subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#338_1_target" name="338_1">1</a></sup> Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No satellite carrier shall be required to carry local television broadcast stations under paragraph (1) until January 1, 2002.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Carriage of signals of local stations in certain markets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A satellite carrier that offers multichannel video programming distribution service in the United States to more than 5,000,000 subscribers shall (A) within 1 year after December 8, 2004, retransmit the signals originating as analog signals of each television broadcast station located in any local market within a State that is not part of the contiguous United States, and (B) within 30 months after December 8, 2004, retransmit the signals originating as digital signals of each such station. The retransmissions of such stations shall be made available to substantially all of the satellite carrier's subscribers in each station's local market, and the retransmissions of the stations in at least one market in the State shall be made available to substantially all of the satellite carrier's subscribers in areas of the State that are not within a designated market area. The cost to subscribers of such retransmissions shall not exceed the cost of retransmissions of local television stations in other States. Within 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Commission shall promulgate regulations concerning elections by television stations in such State between mandatory carriage pursuant to this section and retransmission consent pursuant to section 325(b) of this title, which shall take into account the schedule on which local television stations are made available to viewers in such State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Good signal required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A television broadcast station asserting its right to carriage under subsection (a) of this section shall be required to bear the costs associated with delivering a good quality signal to the designated local receive facility of the satellite carrier or to another facility that is acceptable to at least one-half the stations asserting the right to carriage in the local market.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations issued under subsection (g) of this section shall set forth the obligations necessary to carry out this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Duplication not required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commercial stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1) of this section, a satellite carrier shall not be required to carry upon request the signal of any local commercial television broadcast station that substantially duplicates the signal of another local commercial television broadcast station which is secondarily transmitted by the satellite carrier within the same local market, or to carry upon request the signals of more than one local commercial television broadcast station in a single local market that is affiliated with a particular television network unless such stations are licensed to communities in different States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Noncommercial stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall prescribe regulations limiting the carriage requirements under subsection (a) of this section of satellite carriers with respect to the carriage of multiple local noncommercial television broadcast stations. To the extent possible, such regulations shall provide the same degree of carriage by sat<!-- PDFPage:166 -->ellite carriers of such multiple stations as is provided by cable systems under section 535 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Channel positioning</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No satellite carrier shall be required to provide the signal of a local television broadcast station to subscribers in that station's local market on any particular channel number or to provide the signals in any particular order, except that the satellite carrier shall retransmit the signal of the local television broadcast stations to subscribers in the stations&rsquo; local market on contiguous channels and provide access to such station's signals at a nondiscriminatory price and in a nondiscriminatory manner on any navigational device, on-screen program guide, or menu.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Compensation for carriage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A satellite carrier shall not accept or request monetary payment or other valuable consideration in exchange either for carriage of local television broadcast stations in fulfillment of the requirements of this section or for channel positioning rights provided to such stations under this section, except that any such station may be required to bear the costs associated with delivering a good quality signal to the local receive facility of the satellite carrier.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Remedies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Complaints by broadcast stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever a local television broadcast station believes that a satellite carrier has failed to meet its obligations under subsections (b) through (e) of this section, such station shall notify the carrier, in writing, of the alleged failure and identify its reasons for believing that the satellite carrier failed to comply with such obligations. The satellite carrier shall, within 30 days after such written notification, respond in writing to such notification and comply with such obligations or state its reasons for believing that it is in compliance with such obligations. A local television broadcast station that disputes a response by a satellite carrier that it is in compliance with such obligations may obtain review of such denial or response by filing a complaint with the Commission. Such complaint shall allege the manner in which such satellite carrier has failed to meet its obligations and the basis for such allegations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Opportunity to respond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall afford the satellite carrier against which a complaint is filed under paragraph (1) an opportunity to present data and arguments to establish that there has been no failure to meet its obligations under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remedial actions; dismissal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 120 days after the date a complaint is filed under paragraph (1), the Commission shall determine whether the satellite carrier has met its obligations under subsections (b) through (e) of this section. If the Commission determines that the satellite carrier has failed to meet such obligations, the Commission shall order the satellite carrier to take appropriate remedial action. If the Commission determines that the satellite carrier has fully met the requirements of such subsections, the Commission shall dismiss the complaint.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Carriage of local stations on a single dish</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Single dish</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each satellite carrier that retransmits the analog signals of local television broadcast stations in a local market shall retransmit such analog signals in such market by means of a single reception antenna and associated equipment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the carrier retransmits signals in the digital television service, the carrier shall retransmit such digital signals in such market by means of a single reception antenna and associated equipment, but such antenna and associated equipment may be separate from the single reception antenna and associated equipment used for analog television service signals.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection shall apply on and after 18 months after December 8, 2004.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Notice of disruptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A carrier that is providing signals of a local television broadcast station in a local market under this section on December 8, 2004, shall, not later than 15 months after December 8, 2004, provide to the licensees for such stations and the carrier's subscribers in such local market a notice that displays prominently and conspicuously a clear statement of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) such carrier may continue to provide such distant digital signal to such a subscriber after the date on which the carrier makes available the digital signal of a local network station affiliated with such network only if such subscriber subscribes to the digital signal from such local network station; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the limitation contained in subclause (I) of this clause shall not apply to a subscriber that cannot be reached by the satellite transmission of the local digital signal.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vi) Signal testing for digital signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) A subscriber shall be eligible for a distant digital signal under clause (i)(III) if such subscriber is determined, based on a test conducted in accordance with section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulation, not to be able to receive a signal that exceeds the signal intensity standard in section 73.622(e)(1) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on December 8, 2004.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) Such test shall be conducted, upon written request for a digital signal strength test by the subscriber to the satellite carrier, within 30 days after the date the subscriber submits such request for the test. Such test shall be conducted by a qualified and independent person selected by the satellite carrier and the network station or stations, or who has been previously approved by the satellite carrier and by each affected network station but not previously disapproved. A tester may not be so disapproved for a test after the tester has commenced such test.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) Unless the satellite carrier and the network station or stations otherwise agree, the costs of conducting the test shall be borne as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(aa) If the subscriber is not eligible for a distant digital signal under clause (i)(I) of this subparagraph (by reason of being outside of the coverage area of the analog signal), the satellite carrier may request the station licensee for a waiver.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(bb) If the licensee agrees to a waiver, or fails to respond to a waiver request within 30 days, the subscriber may receive such distant digital signal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(cc) If the licensee refuses to grant a waiver, the subscriber may request the satellite carrier to conduct the test.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(dd) If the satellite carrier requests the test and&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:172 --><p class="statutory-body-5em">(AA) the station's signal is determined to exceed such signal intensity standard, the costs of the test shall be borne by the satellite carrier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(BB) the station's signal is determined to not exceed such signal intensity standard, the costs of the test shall be borne by the licensee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(ee) If the satellite carrier does not request the test, or fails to respond within 30 days, the subscriber may request the test be conducted under the supervision of the carrier, and the costs of the test shall be borne by the subscriber in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission. Such regulations shall also require the carrier to notify the subscriber of the typical costs of such test.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vii) Trigger events for use of testing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A subscriber shall not be eligible for a distant digital signal under clause (i)(III) pursuant to a test conducted under clause (vii) until&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) in the case of a subscriber whose household is located within the area predicted to be served (by the predictive model for analog signals under subsection (b)(3) of this section) by the signal of a local network station and who is seeking a distant digital signal of a station affiliated with the same network as that local network station&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) April 30, 2006, if such local network station is within the top 100 television markets and&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any satellite carrier that knowingly and willfully provides the signals of television stations to subscribers in violation of this subsection shall be liable for a forfeiture penalty under section 503 of this title in the amount of $50,000 for each violation or each day of a continuing violation, except that paragraph (2)(D) of this subsection, relating to the provision of distant digital signals, shall be enforceable under the provisions of section 340(f) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Extension of network nonduplication, syndicated exclusivity, and sports blackout to satellite retransmission</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Extension of protections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 45 days after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall commence a single rulemaking proceeding to establish regulations that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) apply network nonduplication protection (47 CFR 76.92) syndicated exclusivity protection (47 CFR 76.151), and sports blackout protection (47 CFR 76.67) to the retransmission of the signals of nationally distributed superstations by satellite carriers to subscribers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to the extent technically feasible and not economically prohibitive, apply sports blackout protection (47 CFR 76.67) to the retransmission of the signals of network stations by satellite carriers to subscribers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Deadline for action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall complete all actions necessary to prescribe regulations required by this section so that the regulations shall become effective within 1 year after November 29, 1999.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility for retransmission</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Study of digital strength testing procedures</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Study required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Federal Communications Commission shall complete an inquiry regarding whether, for purposes of identifying if a household is unserved by an adequate digital signal under section 119(d)(10) of title 17, the digital signal strength standard in section 73.622(e)(1) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or the testing procedures in section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, such statutes or regulations should be revised to take into account the types of antennas that are available to consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Study considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In conducting the study under this paragraph, the Commission shall consider whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to account for the fact that an antenna can be mounted on a roof or placed in a home and can be fixed or capable of rotating;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, should be amended to create different procedures for determining if the requisite digital signal strength is present than for determining if the requisite analog signal strength is present;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a standard should be used other than the presence of a signal of a certain strength to ensure that a household can <!-- PDFPage:174 -->receive a high-quality picture using antennas of reasonable cost and ease of installation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) to develop a predictive methodology for determining whether a household is unserved by an adequate digital signal under section 119(d)(10) of title 17;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) there is a wide variation in the ability of reasonably priced consumer digital television sets to receive over-the-air signals, such that at a given signal strength some may be able to display high-quality pictures while others cannot, whether such variation is related to the price of the television set, and whether such variation should be factored into setting a standard for determining whether a household is unserved by an adequate digital signal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) to account for factors such as building loss, external interference sources, or undesired signals from both digital television and analog television stations using either the same or adjacent channels in nearby markets, foliage, and man-made clutter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Federal Communications Commission shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report containing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the results of the study under this paragraph; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) recommendations, if any, as to what changes should be made to Federal statutes or regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Waivers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A subscriber who is denied the retransmission of a signal of a network station under section 119 of title 17 may request a waiver from such denial by submitting a request, through such subscriber's satellite carrier, to the network station asserting that the retransmission is prohibited. The network station shall accept or reject a subscriber's request for a waiver within 30 days after receipt of the request. The subscriber shall be permitted to receive such retransmission under section 119(d)(10)(B) of title 17, if such station agrees to the waiver request and files with the satellite carrier a written waiver with respect to that subscriber allowing the subscriber to receive such retransmission. If a television network station fails to accept or reject a subscriber's request for a waiver within the 30-day period after receipt of the request, that station shall be deemed to agree to the waiver request and have filed such written waiver.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Establishment of improved predictive model required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 180 days after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall take all actions necessary, including any reconsideration, to develop and prescribe by rule a point-to-point predictive model for reliably and presumptively determining the ability of individual locations to receive signals in accordance with the signal intensity standard in effect under section 119(d)(10)(A) of title 17. In prescribing such model, the Commission shall rely on the Individual Location Longley-Rice model set forth by the Federal Communications Commission in Docket No. 98&ndash;201 and ensure that such model takes into account terrain, building structures, and other land cover variations. The Commission shall establish procedures for the continued refinement in the application of the model by the use of additional data as it becomes available.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Objective verification</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a subscriber's request for a waiver under paragraph (2) is rejected and the subscriber submits to the subscriber's satellite carrier a request for a test verifying the subscriber's inability to receive a signal that meets the signal intensity standard in effect under section 119(d)(10)(A) of title 17, the satellite carrier and the network station or stations asserting that the retransmission is prohibited with respect to that subscriber shall select a qualified and independent person to conduct a test in accordance with section 73.686(d) of its regulations (47 CFR 73.686(d)), or any successor regulation. Such test shall be conducted within 30 days after the date the subscriber submits a request for the test. If the written findings and conclusions of a test conducted in accordance with such section (or any successor regulation) demonstrate that the subscriber does not receive a signal that meets or exceeds the signal intensity standard in effect under section 119(d)(10)(A) of title 17, the subscriber shall not be denied the retransmission of a signal of a network station under section 119 of title 17.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Designation of tester and allocation of costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the satellite carrier and the network station or stations asserting that the retransmission is prohibited are unable to agree on such a person to conduct the test, the person shall be designated by an independent and neutral entity designated by the Commission by rule. Unless the satellite carrier and the network station or stations otherwise agree, the costs of conducting the test under this paragraph shall be borne by the satellite carrier, if the station's signal meets or exceeds the signal intensity standard in effect under section 119(d)(10)(A) of title 17, or by the network station, if its signal fails to meet or exceed such standard.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Avoidance of undue burden</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Commission regulations prescribed under this paragraph shall seek to avoid any undue burden on any party.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Reduction of verification burdens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Commission shall by rule exempt from the verification requirements of subparagraph (A) any request for a test made by a subscriber to a satellite carrier to whom the retransmission of the signals of local broadcast stations is available under section 338 of this title from such carrier.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:175 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A satellite carrier may refuse to engage in the testing process. If the carrier does so refuse, a subscriber in a local market in which the satellite carrier does not offer the signals of local broadcast stations under section 338 of this title may, at his or her own expense, authorize a signal intensity test to be performed pursuant to the procedures specified by the Commission in section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, by a tester who is approved by the satellite carrier and by each affected network station, or who has been previously approved by the satellite carrier and by each affected network station but not previously disapproved. A tester may not be so disapproved for a test after the tester has commenced such test. The tester shall give 5 business days advance written notice to the satellite carrier and to the affected network station or stations. A signal intensity test conducted in accordance with this subparagraph shall be determinative of the signal strength received at that household for purposes of determining whether the household is capable of receiving a Grade B intensity signal.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (d)(4) of this section, for purposes of paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subsection, the term &ldquo;satellite carrier&rdquo; includes a distributor (as defined in section 119(d)(1) of title 17), but only if the satellite distributor's relationship with the subscriber includes billing, collection, service activation, and service deactivation.</p>
