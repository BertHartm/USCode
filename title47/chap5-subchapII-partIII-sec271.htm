<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Neither a Bell operating company, nor any affiliate of a Bell operating company, may provide interLATA services except as provided in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) InterLATA services to which this section applies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In-region services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A Bell operating company, or any affiliate of that Bell operating company, may provide interLATA services originating in any of its in-region States (as defined in subsection (i) of this section) if the Commission approves the application of such company for such State under subsection (d)(3) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Out-of-region services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A Bell operating company, or any affiliate of that Bell operating company, may provide interLATA services originating outside its in-region States after February 8, 1996, subject to subsection (j) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Incidental interLATA services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A Bell operating company, or any affiliate of a Bell operating company, may provide incidental interLATA services (as defined in subsection (g) of this section) originating in any State after February 8, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section prohibits a Bell operating company or any of its affiliates from providing termination for interLATA services, subject to subsection (j) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requirements for providing certain in-region interLATA services</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Agreement or statement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A Bell operating company meets the requirements of this paragraph if it meets the requirements of subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of this paragraph for each State for which the authorization is sought.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Presence of a facilities-based competitor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A Bell operating company meets the requirements of this subparagraph if it has entered into one or more binding agreements that have been approved under section 252 of this title specifying the terms and conditions under which the Bell operating company is providing access and interconnection to its network facilities for the network facilities of one or more unaffiliated competing providers of telephone exchange service (as defined in section 153(47)(A) of this title, but excluding exchange access) to residential and business subscribers. For the purpose of this subparagraph, such telephone exchange service may be offered by such competing providers either exclusively over their own telephone exchange service facilities or predominantly over their own telephone exchange service facilities in combination with the resale of the telecommunications services of another carrier. For the purpose of this subparagraph, services provided pursuant to subpart K of part 22 of the Commission's regulations (47 C.F.R. 22.901 et seq.) shall not be considered to be telephone exchange services.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Failure to request access</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A Bell operating company meets the requirements of this subparagraph if, after 10 months after February 8, 1996, no such provider has requested the access and interconnection described in subparagraph (A) before the date which is 3 months before the date the company makes its application under subsection (d)(1) of this section, and a statement of the terms and conditions that the company generally offers to provide such access and interconnection has been approved or permitted to take effect by the State commission under section 252(f) of this title. For purposes of this subparagraph, a Bell operating company shall be considered not to have received any request for access and interconnection if the State commission of such State certifies that the only provider or providers making such a request have (i) failed to negotiate in good faith as required by section 252 of this title, or (ii) violated the terms of an agreement approved under section 252 of this title by the provider's failure to comply, within a reasonable period of <!-- PDFPage:96 -->time, with the implementation schedule contained in such agreement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Specific interconnection requirements</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Agreement required</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such access and interconnection meets the requirements of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Competitive checklist</h4>

After that date, compliance with such guidelines, plan, or rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(x) Nondiscriminatory access to databases and associated signaling necessary for call routing and completion.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Until a Bell operating company is authorized pursuant to subsection (d) of this section to provide interLATA services in an in-region State, or until 36 months have passed since February 8, 1996, whichever is earlier, a telecommunications carrier that serves greater than 5 percent of the Nation's presubscribed access lines may not jointly market in such State telephone exchange service obtained from such company pursuant to section 251(c)(4) of this title with interLATA services offered by that telecommunications carrier.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) IntraLATA toll dialing parity</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Provision required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A Bell operating company granted authority to provide interLATA services under subsection (d) of this section shall provide intraLATA toll dialing parity throughout that State coincident with its exercise of that authority.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except for single-LATA States and States that have issued an order by December 19, 1995, requiring a Bell operating company to implement intraLATA toll dialing parity, a State may not require a Bell operating company to implement intraLATA toll dialing parity in that State before a Bell operating company has been granted authority under this section to provide interLATA services originating in that State or before 3 years after February 8, 1996, whichever is earlier. Nothing in this subparagraph precludes a State from issuing an order requiring intraLATA toll dialing parity in that State prior to either such date so long as such order does not take effect until after the earlier of either such dates.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Exception for previously authorized activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Neither subsection (a) of this section nor section 273 of this title shall prohibit a Bell operating company or affiliate from engaging, at any time after February 8, 1996, in any activity to the extent authorized by, and subject to the terms and conditions contained in, an order entered by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia pursuant to section VII or VIII(C) of the AT&T Consent Decree if such order was entered on or before February 8, 1996, to the extent such order is not reversed or vacated on appeal. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit, or to impose terms or conditions on, an activity in which a Bell operating company is otherwise authorized to engage under any other provision of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) &ldquo;Incidental interLATA services&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;incidental interLATA services&rdquo; means the interLATA provision by a Bell operating company or its affiliate&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) of the capability for interaction by such subscribers to select or respond to such audio programming, video programming, or other programming services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to distributors of audio programming or video programming that such company or affiliate owns or controls, or is licensed by the copyright owner of such programming (or by an assignee of such owner) to distribute; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:98 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) of alarm monitoring services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) of two-way interactive video services or Internet services over dedicated facilities to or for elementary and secondary schools as defined in section 254(h)(5)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#271_1_target" name="271_1">1</a></sup> of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) of commercial mobile services in accordance with section 332(c) of this title and with the regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (8) of such section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) of a service that permits a customer that is located in one LATA to retrieve stored information from, or file information for storage in, information storage facilities of such company that are located in another LATA;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsection (g) of this section are intended to be narrowly construed. The interLATA services provided under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of subsection (g)(1) of this section are limited to those interLATA transmissions incidental to the provision by a Bell operating company or its affiliate of video, audio, and other programming services that the company or its affiliate is engaged in providing to the public. The Commission shall ensure that the provision of services authorized under subsection (g) of this section by a Bell operating company or its affiliate will not adversely affect telephone exchange service ratepayers or competition in any telecommunications market.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Additional definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In-region State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;in-region State&rdquo; means a State in which a Bell operating company or any of its affiliates was authorized to provide wireline telephone exchange service pursuant to the reorganization plan approved under the AT&T Consent Decree, as in effect on the day before February 8, 1996.</p>
