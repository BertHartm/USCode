<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings and Policy for Pub. L. 102&ndash;385</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 102&ndash;385, &sect;2(a), (b), Oct. 5, 1992, 106 Stat. 1460, 1463, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Pursuant to the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 [Pub. L. 98&ndash;549, enacting this subchapter and section 611 of this title, amending sections 152, 224, 309, and 605 of this title, section 2511 of Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure, and section 1805 of Title 50, War and National Defense, and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and sections 543, 605, and 609 of this title], rates for cable television services have been deregulated in approximately 97 percent of all franchises since December 29, 1986. Since rate deregulation, monthly rates for the lowest priced basic cable service have increased by 40 percent or more for 28 percent of cable television subscribers. Although the average number of basic channels has increased from about 24 to 30, average monthly rates have increased by 29 percent during the same period. The average monthly cable rate has increased almost 3 times as much as the Consumer Price Index since rate deregulation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) For a variety of reasons, including local franchising requirements and the extraordinary expense of constructing more than one cable television system to serve a particular geographic area, most cable television subscribers have no opportunity to select between competing cable systems. Without the presence of another multichannel video programming distributor, a cable system faces no local competition. The result is undue market power for the cable operator as compared to that of consumers and video programmers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) There has been a substantial increase in the penetration of cable television systems over the past decade. Nearly 56,000,000 households, over 60 percent of the households with televisions, subscribe to cable television, and this percentage is almost certain to increase. As a result of this growth, the cable television industry has become a dominant nationwide video medium.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The cable industry has become highly concentrated. The potential effects of such concentration are barriers to entry for new programmers and a reduction in the number of media voices available to consumers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The cable industry has become vertically integrated; cable operators and cable programmers often have common ownership. As a result, cable operators have the incentive and ability to favor their affiliated programmers. This could make it more difficult for noncable-affiliated programmers to secure carriage on cable systems. Vertically integrated program suppliers also have the incentive and ability to favor their affiliated cable operators over nonaffiliated cable operators and programming distributors using other technologies.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) There is a substantial governmental and First Amendment interest in promoting a diversity of views provided through multiple technology media.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) There is a substantial governmental and First Amendment interest in ensuring that cable subscribers have access to local noncommercial educational stations which Congress has authorized, as expressed in section 396(a)(5) of the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 396(a)(5)]. The distribution of unique noncommercial, educational programming services advances that interest.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The Federal Government has a substantial interest in making all nonduplicative local public television services available on cable systems because&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) public television provides educational and informational programming to the Nation's citizens, thereby advancing the Government's compelling interest in educating its citizens;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) public television is a local community institution, supported through local tax dollars and voluntary citizen contributions in excess of $10,800,000,000 since 1972, that provides public service programming that is responsive to the needs and interests of the local community;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) the Federal Government, in recognition of public television's integral role in serving the educational and informational needs of local communities, has invested more than $3,000,000,000 in public broadcasting since 1969; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) absent carriage requirements there is a substantial likelihood that citizens, who have sup<!-- PDFPage:219 -->ported local public television services, will be deprived of those services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The Federal Government has a substantial interest in having cable systems carry the signals of local commercial television stations because the carriage of such signals is necessary to serve the goals contained in section 307(b) of the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 307(b)] of providing a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of broadcast services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) A primary objective and benefit of our Nation's system of regulation of television broadcasting is the local origination of programming. There is a substantial governmental interest in ensuring its continuation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Broadcast television stations continue to be an important source of local news and public affairs programming and other local broadcast services critical to an informed electorate.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Broadcast television programming is supported by revenues generated from advertising broadcast over stations. Such programming is otherwise free to those who own television sets and do not require cable transmission to receive broadcast signals. There is a substantial governmental interest in promoting the continued availability of such free television programming, especially for viewers who are unable to afford other means of receiving programming.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) As a result of the growth of cable television, there has been a marked shift in market share from broadcast television to cable television services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Cable television systems and broadcast television stations increasingly compete for television advertising revenues. As the proportion of households subscribing to cable television increases, proportionately more advertising revenues will be reallocated from broadcast to cable television systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) A cable television system which carries the signal of a local television broadcaster is assisting the broadcaster to increase its viewership, and thereby attract additional advertising revenues that otherwise might be earned by the cable system operator. As a result, there is an economic incentive for cable systems to terminate the retransmission of the broadcast signal, refuse to carry new signals, or reposition a broadcast signal to a disadvantageous channel position. There is a substantial likelihood that absent the reimposition of such a requirement, additional local broadcast signals will be deleted, repositioned, or not carried.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) As a result of the economic incentive that cable systems have to delete, reposition, or not carry local broadcast signals, coupled with the absence of a requirement that such systems carry local broadcast signals, the economic viability of free local broadcast television and its ability to originate quality local programming will be seriously jeopardized.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) Consumers who subscribe to cable television often do so to obtain local broadcast signals which they otherwise would not be able to receive, or to obtain improved signals. Most subscribers to cable television systems do not or cannot maintain antennas to receive broadcast television services, do not have input selector switches to convert from a cable to antenna reception system, or cannot otherwise receive broadcast television services. The regulatory system created by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 was premised upon the continued existence of mandatory carriage obligations for cable systems, ensuring that local stations would be protected from anticompetitive conduct by cable systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) Cable television systems often are the single most efficient distribution system for television programming. A Government mandate for a substantial societal investment in alternative distribution systems for cable subscribers, such as the &lsquo;A/B&rsquo; input selector antenna system, is not an enduring or feasible method of distribution and is not in the public interest.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(19) At the same time, broadcast programming that is carried remains the most popular programming on cable systems, and a substantial portion of the benefits for which consumers pay cable systems is derived from carriage of the signals of network affiliates, independent television stations, and public television stations. Also cable programming placed on channels adjacent to popular off-the-air signals obtains a larger audience than on other channel positions. Cable systems, therefore, obtain great benefits from local broadcast signals which, until now, they have been able to obtain without the consent of the broadcaster or any copyright liability. This has resulted in an effective subsidy of the development of cable systems by local broadcasters. While at one time, when cable systems did not attempt to compete with local broadcasters for programming, audience, and advertising, this subsidy may have been appropriate, it is so no longer and results in a competitive imbalance between the 2 industries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(20) The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, in its amendments to the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.], limited the regulatory authority of franchising authorities over cable operators. Franchising authorities are finding it difficult under the current regulatory scheme to deny renewals to cable systems that are not adequately serving cable subscribers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(21) Cable systems should be encouraged to carry low-power television stations licensed to the communities served by those systems where the low-power station creates and broadcasts, as a substantial part of its programming day, local programming.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Statement of Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the Congress in this Act [enacting sections 334, 335, 534 to 537, 544a, 548, and 555a of this title, amending sections 325, 332, 522, 532, 533, 541 to 544, 546, 551 to 555, and 558 of this title, and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and sections 325, 531, 543, and 554 of this title] to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) promote the availability to the public of a diversity of views and information through cable television and other video distribution media;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) rely on the marketplace, to the maximum extent feasible, to achieve that availability;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) ensure that cable operators continue to expand, where economically justified, their capacity and the programs offered over their cable systems;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) where cable television systems are not subject to effective competition, ensure that consumer interests are protected in receipt of cable service; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) ensure that cable television operators do not have undue market power vis-a-vis video programmers and consumers.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority to require designation for public, educational, or governmental use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A franchising authority may in its request for proposals require as part of a franchise, and may require as part of a cable operator's proposal for a franchise renewal, subject to section 546 of this title, that channel capacity be designated for public, educational, or governmental use, and channel capacity on institutional networks be designated for educational or governmental use, and may require rules and procedures for the use of the channel capacity designated pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Enforcement authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A franchising authority may enforce any requirement in any franchise regarding the providing or use of such channel capacity. Such enforcement authority includes the authority to enforce any provisions of the franchise for services, facilities, or equipment proposed by the cable operator which relate to public, educational, or governmental use of channel capacity, whether or not required by the franchising authority pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Promulgation of rules and procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any franchise under which channel capacity is designated under subsection (b) of this section, the franchising authority shall prescribe&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) rules and procedures under which such permitted use shall cease.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Editorial control by cable operator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to section 544(d) of this title, a cable operator shall not exercise any editorial control over any public, educational, or governmental use of channel capacity provided pursuant to this section, except a cable operator may refuse to transmit any public access program or portion of a public access program which contains obscenity, indecency, or nudity.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;532. Cable channels for commercial use</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to promote competition in the delivery of diverse sources of video programming and to assure that the widest possible diversity of information sources are made available to the public from cable systems in a manner consistent with growth and development of cable systems.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Designation of channel capacity for commercial use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A cable operator shall designate channel capacity for commercial use by persons unaffiliated with the operator in accordance with the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) An operator of any cable system with 36 or more (but not more than 54) activated channels shall designate 10 percent of such channels which are not otherwise required for use (or the use of which is not prohibited) by Federal law or regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) An operator of any cable system with 55 or more (but not more than 100) activated channels shall designate 15 percent of such channels which are not otherwise required for use (or the use of which is not prohibited) by Federal law or regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) An operator of any cable system with more than 100 activated channels shall designate 15 percent of all such channels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) An operator of any cable system with fewer than 36 activated channels shall not be required to designate channel capacity for commercial use by persons unaffiliated with the operator, unless the cable system is required to provide such channel capacity under the terms of a franchise in effect on October 30, 1984.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) An operator of any cable system in operation on October 30, 1984, shall not be required to remove any service actually being provided on July 1, 1984, in order to comply with this section, but shall make channel capacity available for commercial use as such capacity becomes available until such time as the cable operator is in full compliance with this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any Federal agency, State, or franchising authority may not require any cable system to designate channel capacity for commercial use by unaffiliated persons in excess of the capacity specified in paragraph (1), except as otherwise provided in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A cable operator may not be required, as part of a request for proposals or as part of a proposal for renewal, subject to section 546 of this title, to designate channel capacity for any use (other than commercial use by unaffiliated persons under this section) except as provided in sections 531 and 557 of this title, but a cable operator may offer in a franchise, or proposal for renewal thereof, to provide, consistent with applicable law, such capacity for other than commercial use by such persons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A cable operator may use any unused channel capacity designated pursuant to this section until the use of such channel capacity is obtained, pursuant to a written agreement, by a person unaffiliated with the operator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For the purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;commercial use&rdquo; means the provision of video programming, whether or not for profit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any channel capacity which has been designated for public, educational, or governmental use may not be considered as designated under this section for commercial use for purpose of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of channel capacity by unaffiliated persons; editorial control; restriction on service; rules on rates, terms, and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If a person unaffiliated with the cable operator seeks to use channel capacity designated pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for commercial use, the cable operator shall establish, consistent with the purpose of this section and with rules prescribed by the Commission under paragraph (4), the price, terms, and conditions of such use which are at least sufficient to assure that such use will not adversely affect the operation, financial condition, or market development of the cable system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A cable operator shall not exercise any editorial control over any video programming provided pursuant to this section, or in any other way consider the content of such programming, except that a cable operator may refuse to transmit any leased access program or portion of a leased access program which contains obscenity, indecency, or nudity and may consider such content to the minimum extent necessary to establish a reasonable price for the commercial use of designated channel capacity by an unaffiliated person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any cable system channel designated in accordance with this section shall not be used to provide a cable service that is being provided over such system on October 30, 1984, if the provision of such programming is intended to avoid the purpose of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Commission shall have the authority to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) determine the maximum reasonable rates that a cable operator may establish pursuant to paragraph (1) for commercial use of designated channel capacity, including the rate charged for the billing of rates to subscribers and for the collection of revenue from subscribers by the cable operator for such use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) establish reasonable terms and conditions for such use, including those for billing and collection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) establish procedures for the expedited resolution of disputes concerning rates or carriage under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall establish rules for determin<!-- PDFPage:223 -->ing maximum reasonable rates under subparagraph (A)(i), for establishing terms and conditions under subparagraph (A)(ii), and for providing procedures under subparagraph (A)(iii).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Right of action in district court; relief; factors not to be considered by court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person aggrieved by the failure or refusal of a cable operator to make channel capacity available for use pursuant to this section may bring an action in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the cable system is located to compel that such capacity be made available. If the court finds that the channel capacity sought by such person has not been made available in accordance with this section, or finds that the price, terms, or conditions established by the cable operator are unreasonable, the court may order such system to make available to such person the channel capacity sought, and further determine the appropriate price, terms, or conditions for such use consistent with subsection (c) of this section, and may award actual damages if it deems such relief appropriate. In any such action, the court shall not consider any price, term, or condition established between an operator and an affiliate for comparable services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Petition to Commission; relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person aggrieved by the failure or refusal of a cable operator to make channel capacity available pursuant to this section may petition the Commission for relief under this subsection upon a showing of prior adjudicated violations of this section. Records of previous adjudications resulting in a court determination that the operator has violated this section shall be considered as sufficient for the showing necessary under this subsection. If the Commission finds that the channel capacity sought by such person has not been made available in accordance with this section, or that the price, terms, or conditions established by such system are unreasonable under subsection (c) of this section, the Commission shall, by rule or order, require such operator to make available such channel capacity under price, terms, and conditions consistent with subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which the Commission finds that the prior adjudicated violations of this section constitute a pattern or practice of violations by an operator, the Commission may also establish any further rule or order necessary to assure that the operator provides the diversity of information sources required by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any case in which the Commission finds that the prior adjudicated violations of this section constitute a pattern or practice of violations by any person who is an operator of more than one cable system, the Commission may also establish any further rule or order necessary to assure that such person provides the diversity of information sources required by this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Presumption of reasonableness and good faith</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any action brought under this section in any Federal district court or before the Commission, there shall be a presumption that the price, terms, and conditions for use of channel capacity designated pursuant to subsection (b) of this section are reasonable and in good faith unless shown by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Promulgation of rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding sections 541(c) and 543(a) of this title, at such time as cable systems with 36 or more activated channels are available to 70 percent of households within the United States and are subscribed to by 70 percent of the households to which such systems are available, the Commission may promulgate any additional rules necessary to provide diversity of information sources. Any rules promulgated by the Commission pursuant to this subsection shall not preempt authority expressly granted to franchising authorities under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Cable service unprotected by Constitution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any cable service offered pursuant to this section shall not be provided, or shall be provided subject to conditions, if such cable service in the judgment of the franchising authority or the cable operator is obscene, or is in conflict with community standards in that it is lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent or is otherwise unprotected by the Constitution of the United States. This subsection shall permit a cable operator to enforce prospectively a written and published policy of prohibiting programming that the cable operator reasonably believes describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary community standards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Programming from qualified minority or educational programming sources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section, a cable operator required by this section to designate channel capacity for commercial use may use any such channel capacity for the provision of programming from a qualified minority programming source or from any qualified educational programming source, whether or not such source is affiliated with the cable operator. The channel capacity used to provide programming from a qualified minority programming source or from any qualified educational programming source pursuant to this subsection may not exceed 33 percent of the channel capacity designated pursuant to this section. No programming provided over a cable system on July 1, 1990, may qualify as minority programming or educational programming on that cable system under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;qualified minority programming source&rdquo; means a programming source which devotes substantially all of its programming to coverage of minority viewpoints, or to programming directed at members of minority groups, and which is over 50 percent minority-owned, as the term &ldquo;minority&rdquo; is defined in section 309(i)(3)(C)(ii) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;qualified educational programming source&rdquo; means a programming source which devotes substantially all of its programming to educational or instructional programming that promotes public understanding of mathematics, the sciences, the humanities, and the arts and has a <!-- PDFPage:224 -->documented annual expenditure on programming exceeding $15,000,000. The annual expenditure on programming means all annual costs incurred by the programming source to produce or acquire programs which are scheduled to be televised, and specifically excludes marketing, promotion, satellite transmission and operational costs, and general administrative costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subsection shall substitute for the requirements to carry qualified noncommercial educational television stations as specified under section 535 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Single channel access to indecent programming</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 120 days following October 5, 1992, the Commission shall promulgate regulations designed to limit the access of children to indecent programming, as defined by Commission regulations, and which cable operators have not voluntarily prohibited under subsection (h) of this section by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) requiring cable operators to place on a single channel all indecent programs, as identified by program providers, intended for carriage on channels designated for commercial use under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) requiring cable operators to block such single channel unless the subscriber requests access to such channel in writing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) requiring programmers to inform cable operators if the program would be indecent as defined by Commission regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Cable operators shall comply with the regulations promulgated pursuant to paragraph (1).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Cable operator holding license for multichannel distribution or offering satellite service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for a cable operator to hold a license for multichannel multipoint distribution service, or to offer satellite master antenna television service separate and apart from any franchised cable service, in any portion of the franchise area served by that cable operator's cable system. The Commission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall waive the requirements of this paragraph for all existing multichannel multipoint distribution services and satellite master antenna television services which are owned by a cable operator on October 5, 1992;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may waive the requirements of this paragraph to the extent the Commission determines is necessary to ensure that all significant portions of a franchise area are able to obtain video programming; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Promulgation of rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may prescribe rules with respect to the ownership or control of cable systems by persons who own or control other media of mass communications which serve the same community served by a cable system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Regulation of ownership by States or franchising authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any State or franchising authority may not prohibit the ownership or control of a cable system by any person because of such person's ownership or control of any other media of mass communications or other media interests. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any State or franchising authority from prohibiting the ownership or control of a cable system in a jurisdiction by any person (1) because of such person's ownership or control of any other cable system in such jurisdiction; or (2) in circumstances in which the State or franchising authority determines that the acquisition of such a cable system may eliminate or reduce <!-- PDFPage:225 -->competition in the delivery of cable service in such jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Holding of ownership interests or exercise of editorial control by States or franchising authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (2), a State or franchising authority may hold any ownership interest in any cable system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any State or franchising authority shall not exercise any editorial control regarding the content of any cable service on a cable system in which such governmental entity holds ownership interest (other than programming on any channel designated for educational or governmental use), unless such control is exercised through an entity separate from the franchising authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Enhancement of effective competition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to enhance effective competition, the Commission shall, within one year after October 5, 1992, conduct a proceeding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to prescribe rules and regulations establishing reasonable limits on the number of cable subscribers a person is authorized to reach through cable systems owned by such person, or in which such person has an attributable interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to prescribe rules and regulations establishing reasonable limits on the number of channels on a cable system that can be occupied by a video programmer in which a cable operator has an attributable interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to consider the necessity and appropriateness of imposing limitations on the degree to which multichannel video programming distributors may engage in the creation or production of video programming.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In prescribing rules and regulations under paragraph (1), the Commission shall, among other public interest objectives&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) ensure that cable operators affiliated with video programmers do not favor such programmers in determining carriage on their cable systems or do not unreasonably restrict the flow of the video programming of such programmers to other video distributors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) take particular account of the market structure, ownership patterns, and other relationships of the cable television industry, including the nature and market power of the local franchise, the joint ownership of cable systems and video programmers, and the various types of non-equity controlling interests;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) account for any efficiencies and other benefits that might be gained through increased ownership or control;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) make such rules and regulations reflect the dynamic nature of the communications marketplace;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) not impose limitations which would bar cable operators from serving previously unserved rural areas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) not impose limitations which would impair the development of diverse and high quality video programming.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Combination of interests under prior law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not apply to prohibit any combination of any interests held by any person on July 1, 1984, to the extent of the interests so held as of such date, if the holding of such interests was not inconsistent with any applicable Federal or State law or regulations in effect on that date.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;534. Carriage of local commercial television signals</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Carriage obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each cable operator shall carry, on the cable system of that operator, the signals of local commercial television stations and qualified low power stations as provided by this section. Carriage of additional broadcast television signals on such system shall be at the discretion of such operator, subject to section 325(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Signals required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A cable operator of a cable system with 12 or fewer usable activated channels shall carry the signals of at least three local commercial television stations, except that if such a system has 300 or fewer subscribers, it shall not be subject to any requirements under this section so long as such system does not delete from carriage by that system any signal of a broadcast television station.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A cable operator of a cable system with more than 12 usable activated channels shall carry the signals of local commercial television stations, up to one-third of the aggregate number of usable activated channels of such system.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Selection of signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the number of local commercial television stations exceeds the maximum number of signals a cable system is required to carry under paragraph (1), the cable operator shall have discretion in selecting which such stations shall be carried on its cable system, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) under no circumstances shall a cable operator carry a qualified low power station in lieu of a local commercial television station; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the cable operator elects to carry an affiliate of a broadcast network (as such term is defined by the Commission by regulation), such cable operator shall carry the affiliate of such broadcast network whose city of license reference point, as defined in section 76.53 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations (in effect on January 1, 1991), or any successor regulation thereto, is closest to the principal headend of the cable system.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Content to be carried</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A cable operator shall carry in its entirety, on the cable system of that operator, the primary video, accompanying audio, and line 21 closed caption transmission of each of the local commercial television stations carried on the cable system and, to the extent technically feasible, program-related material carried in the vertical blanking interval or on subcarriers. Retransmission of other material in the vertical blanking internal or other nonprogram-related material (including teletext and other subscription and advertiser-supported information services) shall be at the discretion of the cable operator. Where appropriate and feasible, operators may delete signal enhancements, such as ghost-canceling, from the broadcast signal and employ such enhancements at the system headend or headends.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The cable operator shall carry the entirety of the program schedule of any television station carried on the cable system unless carriage of specific programming is prohibited, and other programming authorized to be substituted, under section 76.67 or subpart F of part 76 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on January 1, 1991), or any successor regulations thereto.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Signal quality</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Nondegradation; technical specifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The signals of local commercial television stations that a cable operator carries shall be carried without material degradation. The Commission shall adopt carriage standards to ensure that, to the extent technically feasible, the quality of signal processing and carriage provided by a cable system for the carriage of local commercial television stations will be no less than that provided by the system for carriage of any other type of signal.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Advanced television</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">At such time as the Commission prescribes modifications of the standards for television broadcast signals, the Commission shall initiate a proceeding to establish any changes in the signal carriage requirements of cable television systems necessary to ensure cable carriage of such broadcast signals of local commercial television stations which have been changed to conform with such modified standards.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Duplication not required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a cable operator shall not be required to carry the signal of any local commercial television station that substantially duplicates the signal of another local commercial television station which is carried on its cable system, or to carry the signals of more than one local commercial television station affiliated with a particular broadcast network (as such term is defined by regulation). If a cable operator elects to carry on its cable system a signal which substantially duplicates the signal of another local commercial television station carried on the cable system, or to carry on its system the signals of more than one local commercial television station affiliated with a particular broadcast network, all such signals shall be counted toward the number of signals the operator is required to carry under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Channel positioning</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each signal carried in fulfillment of the carriage obligations of a cable operator under this section shall be carried on the cable system channel number on which the local commercial television station is broadcast over the air, or on the channel on which it was carried on July 19, 1985, or on the channel on which it was carried on January 1, 1992, at the election of the station, or on such other channel number as is mutually agreed upon by the station and the cable operator. Any dispute regarding the positioning of a local commercial television station shall be resolved by the Commission.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:227 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Signal availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Signals carried in fulfillment of the requirements of this section shall be provided to every subscriber of a cable system. Such signals shall be viewable via cable on all television receivers of a subscriber which are connected to a cable system by a cable operator or for which a cable operator provides a connection. If a cable operator authorizes subscribers to install additional receiver connections, but does not provide the subscriber with such connections, or with the equipment and materials for such connections, the operator shall notify such subscribers of all broadcast stations carried on the cable system which cannot be viewed via cable without a converter box and shall offer to sell or lease such a converter box to such subscribers at rates in accordance with section 543(b)(3) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Identification of signals carried</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator shall identify, upon request by any person, the signals carried on its system in fulfillment of the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator shall provide written notice to a local commercial television station at least 30 days prior to either deleting from carriage or repositioning that station. No deletion or repositioning of a local commercial television station shall occur during a period in which major television ratings services measure the size of audiences of local television stations. The notification provisions of this paragraph shall not be used to undermine or evade the channel positioning or carriage requirements imposed upon cable operators under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Compensation for carriage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator shall not accept or request monetary payment or other valuable consideration in exchange either for carriage of local commercial television stations in fulfillment of the requirements of this section or for the channel positioning rights provided to such stations under this section, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any such station may be required to bear the costs associated with delivering a good quality signal or a baseband video signal to the principal headend of the cable system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a cable operator may accept payments from stations which would be considered distant signals under section 111 of title 17 as indemnification for any increased copyright liability resulting from carriage of such signal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a cable operator may continue to accept monetary payment or other valuable consideration in exchange for carriage or channel positioning of the signal of any local commercial television station carried in fulfillment of the requirements of this section, through, but not beyond, the date of expiration of an agreement thereon between a cable operator and a local commercial television station entered into prior to June 26, 1990.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Low power station carriage obligation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If there are not sufficient signals of full power local commercial television stations to fill the channels set aside under subsection (b) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a cable operator of a cable system with a capacity of 35 or fewer usable activated channels shall be required to carry one qualified low power station; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a cable operator of a cable system with a capacity of more than 35 usable activated channels shall be required to carry two qualified low power stations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of public, educational, or governmental channels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator required to carry more than one signal of a qualified low power station under this subsection may do so, subject to approval by the franchising authority pursuant to section 531 of this title, by placing such additional station on public, educational, or governmental channels not in use for their designated purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Remedies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Complaints by broadcast stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever a local commercial television station believes that a cable operator has failed to meet its obligations under this section, such station shall notify the operator, in writing, of the alleged failure and identify its reasons for believing that the cable operator is obligated to carry the signal of such station or has otherwise failed to comply with the channel positioning or repositioning or other requirements of this section. The cable operator shall, within 30 days of such written notification, respond in writing to such notification and either commence to carry the signal of such station in accordance with the terms requested or state its reasons for believing that it is not obligated to carry such signal or is in compliance with the channel positioning and repositioning and other requirements of this section. A local commercial television station that is denied carriage or channel positioning or repositioning in accordance with this section by a cable operator may obtain review of such denial by filing a complaint with the Commission. Such complaint shall allege the manner in which such cable operator has failed to meet its obligations and the basis for such allegations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Opportunity to respond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall afford such cable operator an opportunity to present data and arguments to establish that there has been no failure to meet its obligations under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remedial actions; dismissal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 120 days after the date a complaint is filed, the Commission shall determine whether the cable operator has met its obligations under this section. If the Commission determines that the cable operator has failed to meet such obligations, the Commission shall order the cable operator to reposition the <!-- PDFPage:228 -->complaining station or, in the case of an obligation to carry a station, to commence carriage of the station and to continue such carriage for at least 12 months. If the Commission determines that the cable operator has fully met the requirements of this section, it shall dismiss the complaint.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Input selector switch rules abolished</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No cable operator shall be required&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide or make available any input selector switch as defined in section 76.5(mm) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or any comparable device; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide information to subscribers about input selector switches or comparable devices.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Regulations by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall, following a rulemaking proceeding, issue regulations implementing the requirements imposed by this section. Such implementing regulations shall include necessary revisions to update section 76.51 of title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Sales presentations and program length commercials</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Carriage pending proceeding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Pending the outcome of the proceeding under paragraph (2), nothing in this chapter shall require a cable operator to carry on any tier, or prohibit a cable operator from carrying on any tier, the signal of any commercial television station or video programming service that is predominantly utilized for the transmission of sales presentations or program length commercials.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Proceeding concerning certain stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 270 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission, notwithstanding prior proceedings to determine whether broadcast television stations that are predominantly utilized for the transmission of sales presentations or program length commercials are serving the public interest, convenience, and necessity, shall complete a proceeding in accordance with this paragraph to determine whether broadcast television stations that are predominantly utilized for the transmission of sales presentations or program length commercials are serving the public interest, convenience, and necessity. In conducting such proceeding, the Commission shall provide appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment. The Commission shall consider the viewing of such stations, the level of competing demands for the spectrum allocated to such stations, and the role of such stations in providing competition to nonbroadcast services offering similar programming. In the event that the Commission concludes that one or more of such stations are serving the public interest, convenience, and necessity, the Commission shall qualify such stations as local commercial television stations for purposes of subsection (a) of this section. In the event that the Commission concludes that one or more of such stations are not serving the public interest, convenience, and necessity, the Commission shall allow the licensees of such stations a reasonable period within which to provide different programming, and shall not deny such stations a renewal expectancy solely because their programming consisted predominantly of sales presentations or program length commercials.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Definitions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Local commercial television station</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;local commercial television station&rdquo; means any full power television broadcast station, other than a qualified noncommercial educational television station within the meaning of section 535(<em>l</em>)(1) of this title, licensed and operating on a channel regularly assigned to its community by the Commission that, with respect to a particular cable system, is within the same television market as the cable system.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exclusions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;local commercial television station&rdquo; shall not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) low power television stations, television translator stations, and passive repeaters which operate pursuant to part 74 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulations thereto;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a television broadcast station that would be considered a distant signal under section 111 of title 17, if such station does not agree to indemnify the cable operator for any increased copyright liability resulting from carriage on the cable system; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a television broadcast station that does not deliver to the principal headend of a cable system either a signal level of &minus;45dBm for UHF signals or &minus;49dBm for VHF signals at the input terminals of the signal processing equipment, if such station does not agree to be responsible for the costs of delivering to the cable system a signal of good quality or a baseband video signal.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Market determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For purposes of this section, a broadcasting station's market shall be determined by the Commission by regulation or order using, where available, commercial publications which delineate television markets based on viewing patterns, except that, following a written request, the Commission may, with respect to a particular television broadcast station, include additional communities within its television market or exclude communities from such station's television market to better effectuate the purposes of this section. In considering such requests, the Commission may determine that particular communities are part of more than one television market.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) In considering requests filed pursuant to clause (i), the Commission shall afford particular attention to the value of localism by taking into account such factors as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) whether the station, or other stations located in the same area, have been his<!-- PDFPage:229 -->torically carried on the cable system or systems within such community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) whether the television station provides coverage or other local service to such community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) whether any other television station that is eligible to be carried by a cable system in such community in fulfillment of the requirements of this section provides news coverage of issues of concern to such community or provides carriage or coverage of sporting and other events of interest to the community; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) evidence of viewing patterns in cable and noncable households within the areas served by the cable system or systems in such community.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) A cable operator shall not delete from carriage the signal of a commercial television station during the pendency of any proceeding pursuant to this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) Within 120 days after the date on which a request is filed under this subparagraph (or 120 days after February 8, 1996, if later), the Commission shall grant or deny the request.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Qualified low power station</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;qualified low power station&rdquo; means any television broadcast station conforming to the rules established for Low Power Television Stations contained in part 74 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such station broadcasts for at least the minimum number of hours of operation required by the Commission for television broadcast stations under part 73 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such station meets all obligations and requirements applicable to television broadcast stations under part 73 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, with respect to the broadcast of nonentertainment programming; programming and rates involving political candidates, election issues, controversial issues of public importance, editorials, and personal attacks; programming for children; and equal employment opportunity; and the Commission determines that the provision of such programming by such station would address local news and informational needs which are not being adequately served by full power television broadcast stations because of the geographic distance of such full power stations from the low power station's community of license;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such station complies with interference regulations consistent with its secondary status pursuant to part 74 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) such station is located no more than 35 miles from the cable system's headend, and delivers to the principal headend of the cable system an over-the-air signal of good quality, as determined by the Commission;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the community of license of such station and the franchise area of the cable system are both located outside of the largest 160 Metropolitan Statistical Areas, ranked by population, as determined by the Office of Management and Budget on June 30, 1990, and the population of such community of license on such date did not exceed 35,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) there is no full power television broadcast station licensed to any community within the county or other political subdivision (of a State) served by the cable system.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to change the secondary status of any low power station as provided in part 74 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on October 5, 1992.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Carriage obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the carriage requirements set forth in section 534 of this title, each cable operator of a cable system shall carry the signals of qualified noncommercial educational television stations in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Requirements to carry qualified stations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General requirement to carry each qualified station</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3) and subsection (e) of this section, each cable operator <!-- PDFPage:230 -->shall carry, on the cable system of that cable operator, any qualified local noncommercial educational television station requesting carriage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Systems with 12 or fewer channels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a cable operator of a cable system with 12 or fewer usable activated channels shall be required to carry the signal of one qualified local noncommercial educational television station; except that a cable operator of such a system shall comply with subsection (c) of this section and may, in its discretion, carry the signals of other qualified noncommercial educational television stations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In the case of a cable system described in subparagraph (A) which operates beyond the presence of any qualified local noncommercial educational television station&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the cable operator shall import and carry on that system the signal of one qualified noncommercial educational television station;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the selection for carriage of such a signal shall be at the election of the cable operator; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) in order to satisfy the requirements for carriage specified in this subsection, the cable operator of the system shall not be required to remove any other programming service actually provided to subscribers on March 29, 1990; except that such cable operator shall use the first channel available to satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Systems with 13 to 36 channels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Subject to subsection (c) of this section, a cable operator of a cable system with 13 to 36 usable activated channels&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) shall carry the signal of at least one qualified local noncommercial educational television station but shall not be required to carry the signals of more than three such stations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) may, in its discretion, carry additional such stations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In the case of a cable system described in this paragraph which operates beyond the presence of any qualified local noncommercial educational television station, the cable operator shall import and carry on that system the signal of at least one qualified noncommercial educational television station to comply with subparagraph (A)(i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The cable operator of a cable system described in this paragraph which carries the signal of a qualified local noncommercial educational station affiliated with a State public television network shall not be required to carry the signal of any additional qualified local noncommercial educational television stations affiliated with the same network if the programming of such additional stations is substantially duplicated by the programming of the qualified local noncommercial educational television station receiving carriage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) A cable operator of a system described in this paragraph which increases the usable activated channel capacity of the system to more than 36 channels on or after March 29, 1990, shall, in accordance with the other provisions of this section, carry the signal of each qualified local noncommercial educational television station requesting carriage, subject to subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Continued carriage of existing stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, all cable operators shall continue to provide carriage to all qualified local noncommercial educational television stations whose signals were carried on their systems as of March 29, 1990. The requirements of this subsection may be waived with respect to a particular cable operator and a particular such station, upon the written consent of the cable operator and the station.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Placement of additional signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A cable operator required to add the signals of qualified local noncommercial educational television stations to a cable system under this section may do so, subject to approval by the franchising authority pursuant to section 531 of this title, by placing such additional stations on public, educational, or governmental channels not in use for their designated purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Systems with more than 36 channels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A cable operator of a cable system with a capacity of more than 36 usable activated channels which is required to carry the signals of three qualified local noncommercial educational television stations shall not be required to carry the signals of additional such stations the programming of which substantially duplicates the programming broadcast by another qualified local noncommercial educational television station requesting carriage. Substantial duplication shall be defined by the Commission in a manner that promotes access to distinctive noncommercial educational television services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Waiver of nonduplication rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A qualified local noncommercial educational television station whose signal is carried by a cable operator shall not assert any network nonduplication rights it may have pursuant to section 76.92 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, to require the deletion of programs aired on other qualified local noncommercial educational television stations whose signals are carried by that cable operator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Conditions of carriage</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Content to be carried</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator shall retransmit in its entirety the primary video, accompanying audio, and line 21 closed caption transmission of each qualified local noncommercial educational television station whose signal is carried on the cable system, and, to the extent technically feasible, program-related material carried in the vertical blanking interval, or on subcarriers, that may be necessary for receipt of programming by handicapped persons or for educational or language purposes. Retransmission of other material in the vertical blanking interval or on subcarriers shall be within the discretion of the cable operator.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:231 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Bandwidth and technical quality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator shall provide each qualified local noncommercial educational television station whose signal is carried in accordance with this section with bandwidth and technical capacity equivalent to that provided to commercial television broadcast stations carried on the cable system and shall carry the signal of each qualified local noncommercial educational television station without material degradation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Changes in carriage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The signal of a qualified local noncommercial educational television station shall not be repositioned by a cable operator unless the cable operator, at least 30 days in advance of such repositioning, has provided written notice to the station and all subscribers of the cable system. For purposes of this paragraph, repositioning includes (A) assignment of a qualified local noncommercial educational television station to a cable system channel number different from the cable system channel number to which the station was assigned as of March 29, 1990, and (B) deletion of the station from the cable system. The notification provisions of this paragraph shall not be used to undermine or evade the channel positioning or carriage requirements imposed upon cable operators under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Good quality signal required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, a cable operator shall not be required to carry the signal of any qualified local noncommercial educational television station which does not deliver to the cable system's principal headend a signal of good quality or a baseband video signal, as may be defined by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Channel positioning</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each signal carried in fulfillment of the carriage obligations of a cable operator under this section shall be carried on the cable system channel number on which the qualified local noncommercial educational television station is broadcast over the air, or on the channel on which it was carried on July 19, 1985, at the election of the station, or on such other channel number as is mutually agreed upon by the station and the cable operator. Any dispute regarding the positioning of a qualified local noncommercial educational television station shall be resolved by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Availability of signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Signals carried in fulfillment of the carriage obligations of a cable operator under this section shall be available to every subscriber as part of the cable system's lowest priced service tier that includes the retransmission of local commercial television broadcast signals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Payment for carriage prohibited</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator shall not accept monetary payment or other valuable consideration in exchange for carriage of the signal of any qualified local noncommercial educational television station carried in fulfillment of the requirements of this section, except that such a station may be required to bear the cost associated with delivering a good quality signal or a baseband video signal to the principal headend of the cable system.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Distant signal exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a cable operator shall not be required to add the signal of a qualified local noncommercial educational television station not already carried under the provision of subsection (c) of this section, where such signal would be considered a distant signal for copyright purposes unless such station indemnifies the cable operator for any increased copyright costs resulting from carriage of such signal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Remedies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Complaint</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever a qualified local noncommercial educational television station believes that a cable operator of a cable system has failed to comply with the signal carriage requirements of this section, the station may file a complaint with the Commission. Such complaint shall allege the manner in which such cable operator has failed to comply with such requirements and state the basis for such allegations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Opportunity to respond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall afford such cable operator an opportunity to present data, views, and arguments to establish that the cable operator has complied with the signal carriage requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remedial actions; dismissal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 120 days after the date a complaint is filed under this subsection, the Commission shall determine whether the cable operator has complied with the requirements of this section. If the Commission determines that the cable operator has failed to comply with such requirements, the Commission shall state with particularity the basis for such findings and order the cable operator to take such remedial action as is necessary to meet such requirements. If the Commission determines that the cable operator has fully complied with such requirements, the Commission shall dismiss the complaint.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Identification of signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A cable operator shall identify, upon request by any person, those signals carried in fulfillment of the requirements of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to discontinue the provision of a telecommunications service, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to discontinue the operation of a cable system, to the extent such cable system is used for the provision of a telecommunications service, by reason of the failure of such cable operator or affiliate thereof to obtain a franchise or franchise renewal under this subchapter with respect to the provision of such telecommunications service.</p>

Such informational tariffs shall specify the rates, terms, and conditions for the provision of such service, including whether it is made available to all subscribers generally, and shall take effect on the date specified therein.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:234 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to affect the authority of any State to regulate any cable operator to the extent that such operator provides any communication service other than cable service, whether offered on a common carrier or private contract basis.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Payment under terms of franchise</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the limitation of subsection (b) of this section, any cable operator may be required under the terms of any franchise to pay a franchise fee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount of fees per annum</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any twelve-month period, the franchise fees paid by a cable operator with respect to any cable system shall not exceed 5 percent of such cable operator's gross revenues derived in such period from the operation of the cable system to provide cable services. For purposes of this section, the 12-month period shall be the 12-month period applicable under the franchise for accounting purposes. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a franchising authority and a cable operator from agreeing that franchise fees which lawfully could be collected for any such 12-month period shall be paid on a prepaid or deferred basis; except that the sum of the fees paid during the term of the franchise may not exceed the amount, including the time value of money, which would have lawfully been collected if such fees had been paid per annum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Itemization of subscriber bills</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each cable operator may identify, consistent with the regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section 543 of this title, as a separate line item on each regular bill of each subscriber, each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The amount of the total bill assessed as a franchise fee and the identity of the franchising authority to which the fee is paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The amount of the total bill assessed to satisfy any requirements imposed on the cable operator by the franchise agreement to support public, educational, or governmental channels or the use of such channels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The amount of any other fee, tax, assessment, or charge of any kind imposed by any governmental authority on the transaction between the operator and the subscriber.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Court actions; reflection of costs in rate structures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any court action under subsection (c) of this section, the franchising authority shall demonstrate that the rate structure reflects all costs of the franchise fees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Decreases passed through to subscribers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any cable operator shall pass through to subscribers the amount of any decrease in a franchise fee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Itemization of franchise fee in bill</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A cable operator may designate that portion of a subscriber's bill attributable to the franchise fee as a separate item on the bill.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) &ldquo;Franchise fee&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;franchise fee&rdquo; includes any tax, fee, or assessment of any kind imposed by a franchising authority or other governmental entity on a cable operator or cable subscriber, or both, solely because of their status as such;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;franchise fee&rdquo; does not include&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:235 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any tax, fee, or assessment of general applicability (including any such tax, fee, or assessment imposed on both utilities and cable operators or their services but not including a tax, fee, or assessment which is unduly discriminatory against cable operators or cable subscribers);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of any franchise in effect on October 30, 1984, payments which are required by the franchise to be made by the cable operator during the term of such franchise for, or in support of the use of, public, educational, or governmental access facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of any franchise granted after October 30, 1984, capital costs which are required by the franchise to be incurred by the cable operator for public, educational, or governmental access facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) requirements or charges incidental to the awarding or enforcing of the franchise, including payments for bonds, security funds, letters of credit, insurance, indemnification, penalties, or liquidated damages; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) any fee imposed under title 17.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Uncompensated services; taxes, fees and other assessments; limitation on fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit any authority of a franchising authority to impose a tax, fee, or other assessment of any kind on any person (other than a cable operator) with respect to cable service or other communications service provided by such person over a cable system for which charges are assessed to subscribers but not received by the cable operator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For any 12-month period, the fees paid by such person with respect to any such cable service or other communications service shall not exceed 5 percent of such person's gross revenues derived in such period from the provision of such service over the cable system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Regulatory authority of Federal agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any Federal agency may not regulate the amount of the franchise fees paid by a cable operator, or regulate the use of funds derived from such fees, except as provided in this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;543. Regulation of rates</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Competition preference; local and Federal regulation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No Federal agency or State may regulate the rates for the provision of cable service except to the extent provided under this section and section 532 of this title. Any franchising authority may regulate the rates for the provision of cable service, or any other communications service provided over a cable system to cable subscribers, but only to the extent provided under this section. No Federal agency, State, or franchising authority may regulate the rates for cable service of a cable system that is owned or operated by a local government or franchising authority within whose jurisdiction that cable system is located and that is the only cable system located within such jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Preference for competition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission finds that a cable system is subject to effective competition, the rates for the provision of cable service by such system shall not be subject to regulation by the Commission or by a State or franchising authority under this section. If the Commission finds that a cable system is not subject to effective competition&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the rates for the provision of basic cable service shall be subject to regulation by a franchising authority, or by the Commission if the Commission exercises jurisdiction pursuant to paragraph (6), in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the rates for cable programming services shall be subject to regulation by the Commission under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Qualification of franchising authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A franchising authority that seeks to exercise the regulatory jurisdiction permitted under paragraph (2)(A) shall file with the Commission a written certification that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the franchising authority will adopt and administer regulations with respect to the rates subject to regulation under this section that are consistent with the regulations prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the franchising authority has the legal authority to adopt, and the personnel to administer, such regulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) procedural laws and regulations applicable to rate regulation proceedings by such authority provide a reasonable opportunity for consideration of the views of interested parties.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:236 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Approval by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A certification filed by a franchising authority under paragraph (3) shall be effective 30 days after the date on which it is filed unless the Commission finds, after notice to the authority and a reasonable opportunity for the authority to comment, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the franchising authority has adopted or is administering regulations with respect to the rates subject to regulation under this section that are not consistent with the regulations prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the franchising authority does not have the legal authority to adopt, or the personnel to administer, such regulations; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) procedural laws and regulations applicable to rate regulation proceedings by such authority do not provide a reasonable opportunity for consideration of the views of interested parties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If the Commission disapproves a franchising authority's certification, the Commission shall notify the franchising authority of any revisions or modifications necessary to obtain approval.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Revocation of jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon petition by a cable operator or other interested party, the Commission shall review the regulation of cable system rates by a franchising authority under this subsection. A copy of the petition shall be provided to the franchising authority by the person filing the petition. If the Commission finds that the franchising authority has acted inconsistently with the requirements of this subsection, the Commission shall grant appropriate relief. If the Commission, after the franchising authority has had a reasonable opportunity to comment, determines that the State and local laws and regulations are not in conformance with the regulations prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall revoke the jurisdiction of such authority.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Exercise of jurisdiction by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission disapproves a franchising authority's certification under paragraph (4), or revokes such authority's jurisdiction under paragraph (5), the Commission shall exercise the franchising authority's regulatory jurisdiction under paragraph (2)(A) until the franchising authority has qualified to exercise that jurisdiction by filing a new certification that meets the requirements of paragraph (3). Such new certification shall be effective upon approval by the Commission. The Commission shall act to approve or disapprove any such new certification within 90 days after the date it is filed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Aggregation of equipment costs</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall allow cable operators, pursuant to any rules promulgated under subsection (b)(3) of this section, to aggregate, on a franchise, system, regional, or company level, their equipment costs into broad categories, such as converter boxes, regardless of the varying levels of functionality of the equipment within each such broad category. Such aggregation shall not be permitted with respect to equipment used by subscribers who receive only a rate regulated basic service tier.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Revision to Commission rules; forms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 120 days of February 8, 1996, the Commission shall issue revisions to the appropriate rules and forms necessary to implement subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment of basic service tier rate regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commission obligation to subscribers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall, by regulation, ensure that the rates for the basic service tier are reasonable. Such regulations shall be designed to achieve the goal of protecting subscribers of any cable system that is not subject to effective competition from rates for the basic service tier that exceed the rates that would be charged for the basic service tier if such cable system were subject to effective competition.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Commission regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall prescribe, and periodically thereafter revise, regulations to carry out its obligations under paragraph (1). In prescribing such regulations, the Commission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall seek to reduce the administrative burdens on subscribers, cable operators, franchising authorities, and the Commission;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may adopt formulas or other mechanisms and procedures in complying with the requirements of subparagraph (A); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) shall take into account the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the rates for cable systems, if any, that are subject to effective competition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the direct costs (if any) of obtaining, transmitting, and otherwise providing signals carried on the basic service tier, including signals and services carried on the basic service tier pursuant to paragraph (7)(B), and changes in such costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) only such portion of the joint and common costs (if any) of obtaining, transmitting, and otherwise providing such signals as is determined, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission, to be reasonably and properly allocable to the basic service tier, and changes in such costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the revenues (if any) received by a cable operator from advertising from programming that is carried as part of the basic service tier or from other consideration obtained in connection with the basic service tier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the reasonably and properly allocable portion of any amount assessed as a franchise fee, tax, or charge of any kind imposed by any State or local authority on the transactions between cable operators and cable subscribers or any other fee, tax, or assessment of general applicability imposed by a governmental entity applied against cable operators or cable subscribers;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:237 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) any amount required, in accordance with paragraph (4), to satisfy franchise requirements to support public, educational, or governmental channels or the use of such channels or any other services required under the franchise; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) a reasonable profit, as defined by the Commission consistent with the Commission's obligations to subscribers under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Equipment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection shall include standards to establish, on the basis of actual cost, the price or rate for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) installation and lease of the equipment used by subscribers to receive the basic service tier, including a converter box and a remote control unit and, if requested by the subscriber, such addressable converter box or other equipment as is required to access programming described in paragraph (8); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) installation and monthly use of connections for additional television receivers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Costs of franchise requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection shall include standards to identify costs attributable to satisfying franchise requirements to support public, educational, and governmental channels or the use of such channels or any other services required under the franchise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Implementation and enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection shall include additional standards, guidelines, and procedures concerning the implementation and enforcement of such regulations, which shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) procedures by which cable operators may implement and franchising authorities may enforce the regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) procedures for the expeditious resolution of disputes between cable operators and franchising authorities concerning the administration of such regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) standards and procedures to prevent unreasonable charges for changes in the subscriber's selection of services or equipment subject to regulation under this section, which standards shall require that charges for changing the service tier selected shall be based on the cost of such change and shall not exceed nominal amounts when the system's configuration permits changes in service tier selection to be effected solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple method; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) standards and procedures to assure that subscribers receive notice of the availability of the basic service tier required under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The procedures prescribed by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (5)(A) shall require a cable operator to provide 30 days&rsquo; advance notice to a franchising authority of any increase proposed in the price to be charged for the basic service tier.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Components of basic tier subject to rate regulation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Minimum contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each cable operator of a cable system shall provide its subscribers a separately available basic service tier to which subscription is required for access to any other tier of service. Such basic service tier shall, at a minimum, consist of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) All signals carried in fulfillment of the requirements of sections 534 and 535 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Any public, educational, and governmental access programming required by the franchise of the cable system to be provided to subscribers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Any signal of any television broadcast station that is provided by the cable operator to any subscriber, except a signal which is secondarily transmitted by a satellite carrier beyond the local service area of such station.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Permitted additions to basic tier</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A cable operator may add additional video programming signals or services to the basic service tier. Any such additional signals or services provided on the basic service tier shall be provided to subscribers at rates determined under the regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Buy-through of other tiers prohibited</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A cable operator may not require the subscription to any tier other than the basic service tier required by paragraph (7) as a condition of access to video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis. A cable operator may not discriminate between subscribers to the basic service tier and other subscribers with regard to the rates charged for video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception; limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The prohibition in subparagraph (A) shall not apply to a cable system that, by reason of the lack of addressable converter boxes or other technological limitations, does not permit the operator to offer programming on a per channel or per program basis in the same manner required by subparagraph (A). This subparagraph shall not be available to any cable operator after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the technology utilized by the cable system is modified or improved in a way that eliminates such technological limitation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 10 years after October 5, 1992, subject to subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, in any proceeding initiated at the request of any cable operator, the Commission determines that compliance with the requirements of subparagraph (A) would require the cable operator to increase its rates, the Commission may, to the extent <!-- PDFPage:238 -->consistent with the public interest, grant such cable operator a waiver from such requirements for such specified period as the Commission determines reasonable and appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Regulation of unreasonable rates</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commission regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall, by regulation, establish the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) criteria prescribed in accordance with paragraph (2) for identifying, in individual cases, rates for cable programming services that are unreasonable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) fair and expeditious procedures for the receipt, consideration, and resolution of complaints from any franchising authority (in accordance with paragraph (3)) alleging that a rate for cable programming services charged by a cable operator violates the criteria prescribed under subparagraph (A), which procedures shall include the minimum showing that shall be required for a complaint to obtain Commission consideration and resolution of whether the rate in question is unreasonable; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the procedures to be used to reduce rates for cable programming services that are determined by the Commission to be unreasonable and to refund such portion of the rates or charges that were paid by subscribers after the filing of the first complaint filed with the franchising authority under paragraph (3) and that are determined to be unreasonable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Factors to be considered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In establishing the criteria for determining in individual cases whether rates for cable programming services are unreasonable under paragraph (1)(A), the Commission shall consider, among other factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the rates for similarly situated cable systems offering comparable cable programming services, taking into account similarities in facilities, regulatory and governmental costs, the number of subscribers, and other relevant factors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the rates for cable systems, if any, that are subject to effective competition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the history of the rates for cable programming services of the system, including the relationship of such rates to changes in general consumer prices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the rates, as a whole, for all the cable programming, cable equipment, and cable services provided by the system, other than programming provided on a per channel or per program basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) capital and operating costs of the cable system, including the quality and costs of the customer service provided by the cable system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the revenues (if any) received by a cable operator from advertising from programming that is carried as part of the service for which a rate is being established, and changes in such revenues, or from other consideration obtained in connection with the cable programming services concerned.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Review of rate changes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall review any complaint submitted by a franchising authority after February 8, 1996, concerning an increase in rates for cable programming services and issue a final order within 90 days after it receives such a complaint, unless the parties agree to extend the period for such review. A franchising authority may not file a complaint under this paragraph unless, within 90 days after such increase becomes effective it receives subscriber complaints.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Sunset of upper tier rate regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to cable programming services provided after March 31, 1999.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Uniform rate structure required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A cable operator shall have a rate structure, for the provision of cable service, that is uniform throughout the geographic area in which cable service is provided over its cable system. This subsection does not apply to (1) a cable operator with respect to the provision of cable service over its cable system in any geographic area in which the video programming services offered by the operator in that area are subject to effective competition, or (2) any video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis. Bulk discounts to multiple dwelling units shall not be subject to this subsection, except that a cable operator of a cable system that is not subject to effective competition may not charge predatory prices to a multiple dwelling unit. Upon a prima facie showing by a complainant that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the discounted price is predatory, the cable system shall have the burden of showing that its discounted price is not predatory.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Discrimination; services for the hearing impaired</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as prohibiting any Federal agency, State, or a franchising authority from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prohibiting discrimination among subscribers and potential subscribers to cable service, except that no Federal agency, State, or franchising authority may prohibit a cable operator from offering reasonable discounts to senior citizens or other economically disadvantaged group discounts; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) requiring and regulating the installation or rental of equipment which facilitates the reception of cable service by hearing impaired individuals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Negative option billing prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A cable operator shall not charge a subscriber for any service or equipment that the subscriber has not affirmatively requested by name. For purposes of this subsection, a subscriber's failure to refuse a cable operator's proposal to provide such service or equipment shall not be deemed to be an affirmative request for such service or equipment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Collection of information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall, by regulation, require cable operators to file with the Commission or a franchising authority, as appropriate, within <!-- PDFPage:239 -->one year after October 5, 1992, and annually thereafter, such financial information as may be needed for purposes of administering and enforcing this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Prevention of evasions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall, by regulation, establish standards, guidelines, and procedures to prevent evasions, including evasions that result from retiering, of the requirements of this section and shall, thereafter, periodically review and revise such standards, guidelines, and procedures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Small system burdens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In developing and prescribing regulations pursuant to this section, the Commission shall design such regulations to reduce the administrative burdens and cost of compliance for cable systems that have 1,000 or fewer subscribers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Rate regulation agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During the term of an agreement made before July 1, 1990, by a franchising authority and a cable operator providing for the regulation of basic cable service rates, where there was not effective competition under Commission rules in effect on that date, nothing in this section (or the regulations thereunder) shall abridge the ability of such franchising authority to regulate rates in accordance with such an agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Reports on average prices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall annually publish statistical reports on the average rates for basic cable service and other cable programming, and for converter boxes, remote control units, and other equipment, of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) cable systems that the Commission has found are subject to effective competition under subsection (a)(2) of this section, compared with</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) cable systems that the Commission has found are not subject to such effective competition.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the franchise area is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) served by at least two unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributors each of which offers comparable video programming to at least 50 percent of the households in the franchise area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the number of households subscribing to programming services offered by multichannel video programming distributors other than the largest multichannel video programming distributor exceeds 15 percent of the households in the franchise area;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a multichannel video programming distributor operated by the franchising authority for that franchise area offers video programming to at least 50 percent of the households in that franchise area; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a local exchange carrier or its affiliate (or any multichannel video programming distributor using the facilities of such carrier or its affiliate) offers video programming services directly to subscribers by any means (other than direct-to-home satellite services) in the franchise area of an unaffiliated cable operator which is providing cable service in that franchise area, but only if the video programming services so offered in that area are comparable to the video programming services provided by the unaffiliated cable operator in that area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;cable programming service&rdquo; means any video programming provided over a cable system, regardless of service tier, including installation or rental of equipment used for the receipt of such video programming, other than (A) video programming carried on the basic service tier, and (B) video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Special rules for small companies</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">in any franchise area in which that operator services 50,000 or fewer subscribers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) &ldquo;Small cable operator&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;small cable operator&rdquo; means a cable operator that, directly or through an affiliate, serves in the aggregate fewer than 1 percent of all subscribers in the United States and is not affiliated with any entity or entities whose gross annual revenues in the aggregate exceed $250,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Treatment of prior year losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or of section 532 of this title, losses associated with a cable system (including losses associated with the grant or award of a franchise) that were incurred prior to September 4, 1992, with respect to a cable system that is owned and operated by the original franchisee of such system shall not be disallowed, in whole or in part, in the determination of whether the rates for any tier of service or any type of equipment that is subject to regulation under this section are lawful.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Cable service unprotected by Constitution; blockage of premium channel upon request</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as prohibiting a franchising authority and a cable operator from specifying, in a franchise or renewal thereof, that certain cable services shall not be provided or shall be provided subject to conditions, if such cable services are obscene or are otherwise unprotected by the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In order to restrict the viewing of of of&nbsp;<sup><a href="#544_1_target" name="544_1">1</a></sup> programming which is obscene or indecent, upon the request of a subscriber, a cable operator shall provide (by sale or lease) a device by which the subscriber can prohibit viewing of a particular cable service during periods selected by that subscriber.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If a cable operator provides a premium channel without charge to cable subscribers who do not subscribe to such premium channel, the <!-- PDFPage:241 -->cable operator shall, not later than 30 days before such premium channel is provided without charge&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Technical standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within one year after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall prescribe regulations which establish minimum technical standards relating to cable systems&rsquo; technical operation and signal quality. The Commission shall update such standards periodically to reflect improvements in technology. No State or franchising authority may prohibit, condition, or restrict a cable system's use of any type of subscriber equipment or any transmission technology.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation on regulatory powers of Federal agencies, States, or franchising authorities; exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any Federal agency, State, or franchising authority may not impose requirements regarding the provision or content of cable services, except as expressly provided in this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any rule, regulation, or order issued under any Federal law, as such rule, regulation, or order (i) was in effect on September 21, 1983, or (ii) may be amended after such date if the rule, regulation, or order as amended is not inconsistent with the express provisions of this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any rule, regulation, or order under title 17.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Access to emergency information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any such rule, regulation, or order, each cable operator shall comply with such standards as the Commission shall prescribe to ensure that viewers of video programming on cable systems are afforded the same emergency information as is afforded by the emergency broadcasting system pursuant to Commission regulations in subpart G of part 73, title 47, Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Notice of changes in and comments on services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A franchising authority may require a cable operator to do any one or more of the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Inform subscribers, via written notice, that comments on programming and channel position changes are being recorded by a designated office of the franchising authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Disposition of cable upon termination of service</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) new and recent models of television receivers and video cassette recorders often contain premium features and functions that are disabled or inhibited because of cable scrambling, encoding, or encryption technologies and devices, including converter boxes and remote control devices required by cable operators to receive programming;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if these problems are allowed to persist, consumers will be less likely to purchase, and electronics equipment manufacturers will be less likely to develop, manufacture, or offer for sale, television receivers and video cassette recorders with new and innovative features and functions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) cable operators should use technologies that will prevent signal thefts while permitting consumers to benefit from such features and functions in such receivers and recorders; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) compatibility among televisions, video cassette recorders, and cable systems can be assured with narrow technical standards that mandate a minimum degree of common design and operation, leaving all features, functions, protocols, and other product and service options for selection through open competition in the market.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compatible interfaces</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Report; regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 1 year after October 5, 1992, the Commission, in consultation with representatives of the cable industry and the consumer electronics industry, shall report to Congress on means of assuring compatibility between televisions and video cassette recorders and cable systems, consistent with the need to prevent theft of cable service, so that cable subscribers will be able to enjoy the full benefit of both the programming available on cable systems and the functions available on their televisions and video cassette recorders. Within 180 days after the date of submission of the report required by this subsection, the Commission shall issue such regulations as are necessary to assure such compatibility.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Scrambling and encryption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In issuing the regulations referred to in paragraph (1), the Commission shall determine whether and, if so, under what circumstances to permit cable systems to scramble or encrypt signals or to restrict cable systems in the manner in which they encrypt or scramble signals, except that the Commission shall not limit the use of scrambling or encryption technology where the use of such technology does not interfere with the functions of subscribers&rsquo; television receivers or video cassette recorders.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rulemaking requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Factors to be considered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In prescribing the regulations required by this section, the Commission shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the need to maximize open competition in the market for all features, functions, protocols, and other product and service options of converter boxes and other cable converters unrelated to the descrambling or decryption of cable television signals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the costs and benefits to consumers of imposing compatibility requirements on cable operators and television manufacturers in a manner that, while providing effective protection against theft or unauthorized reception of cable service, will minimize interference with or nullification of the special functions of subscribers&rsquo; television receivers or video cassette recorders, including functions that permit the subscriber&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to watch a program on one channel while simultaneously using a video cassette recorder to tape a program on another channel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to use a video cassette recorder to tape two consecutive programs that appear on different channels; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to use advanced television picture generation and display features; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the need for cable operators to protect the integrity of the signals transmitted by the cable operator against theft or to protect such signals against unauthorized reception.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this section shall include such regulations as are necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to specify the technical requirements with which a television receiver or video cassette recorder must comply in order to be sold as &ldquo;cable compatible&rdquo; or &ldquo;cable ready&rdquo;;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to require cable operators offering channels whose reception requires a converter box&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to notify subscribers that they may be unable to benefit from the special functions of their television receivers and video cassette recorders, including functions that permit subscribers&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) to watch a program on one channel while simultaneously using a video cassette recorder to tape a program on another channel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) to use a video cassette recorder to tape two consecutive programs that appear on different channels; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) to use advanced television picture generation and display features; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to the extent technically and economically feasible, to offer subscribers the option of having all other channels delivered directly to the subscribers&rsquo; television receivers or video cassette recorders without passing through the converter box;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to promote the commercial availability, from cable operators and retail vendors that are not affiliated with cable systems, of <!-- PDFPage:243 -->converter boxes and of remote control devices compatible with converter boxes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to ensure that any standards or regulations developed under the authority of this section to ensure compatibility between televisions, video cassette recorders, and cable systems do not affect features, functions, protocols, and other product and service options other than those specified in paragraph (1)(B), including telecommunications interface equipment, home automation communications, and computer network services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) to require a cable operator who offers subscribers the option of renting a remote control unit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to notify subscribers that they may purchase a commercially available remote control device from any source that sells such devices rather than renting it from the cable operator; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to specify the types of remote control units that are compatible with the converter box supplied by the cable operator; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) to prohibit a cable operator from taking any action that prevents or in any way disables the converter box supplied by the cable operator from operating compatibly with commercially available remote control units.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Review of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall periodically review and, if necessary, modify the regulations issued pursuant to this section in light of any actions taken in response to such regulations and to reflect improvements and changes in cable systems, television receivers, video cassette recorders, and similar technology.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Grounds for modification by franchising authority; public proceeding; time of decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) During the period a franchise is in effect, the cable operator may obtain from the franchising authority modifications of the requirements in such franchise&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of any such requirement for facilities or equipment, including public, educational, or governmental access facilities or equipment, if the cable operator demonstrates that (i) it is commercially impracticable for the operator to comply with such requirement, and (ii) the proposal by the cable operator for modification of such requirement is appropriate because of commercial impracticability; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of any such requirement for services, if the cable operator demonstrates that the mix, quality, and level of services required by the franchise at the time it was granted will be maintained after such modification.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any final decision by a franchising authority under this subsection shall be made in a public proceeding. Such decision shall be made within 120 days after receipt of such request by the franchising authority, unless such 120 day period is extended by mutual agreement of the cable operator and the franchising authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Judicial proceedings; grounds for modification by court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any cable operator whose request for modification under subsection (a) of this section has been denied by a final decision of a franchising authority may obtain modification of such franchise requirements pursuant to the provisions of section 555 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of any proposed modification of a requirement for facilities or equipment, the court shall grant such modification only if the cable operator demonstrates to the court that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) it is commercially impracticable for the operator to comply with such requirement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the terms of the modification requested are appropriate because of commercial impracticability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of any proposed modification of a requirement for services, the court shall grant such modification only if the cable operator demonstrates to the court that the mix, quality, and level of services required by the franchise at the time it was granted will be maintained after such modification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rearrangement, replacement, or removal of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section, a cable operator may, upon 30 days&rsquo; advance notice to the franchising authority, rearrange, replace, or remove a particular cable service required by the franchise if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such service is no longer available to the operator; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such service is available to the operator only upon the payment of a royalty required under section 801(b)(2) of title 17, which the cable operator can document&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is substantially in excess of the amount of such payment required on the date of the operator's offer to provide such service, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has not been specifically compensated for through a rate increase or other adjustment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rearrangement of particular services from one service tier to another or other offering of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section, a cable operator may take such actions <!-- PDFPage:244 -->to rearrange a particular service from one service tier to another, or otherwise offer the service, if the rates for all of the service tiers involved in such actions are not subject to regulation under section 543 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Requirements for services relating to public, educational, or governmental access</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A cable operator may not obtain modification under this section of any requirement for services relating to public, educational, or governmental access.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) &ldquo;Commercially impracticable&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;commercially impracticable&rdquo; means, with respect to any requirement applicable to a cable operator, that it is commercially impracticable for the operator to comply with such requirement as a result of a change in conditions which is beyond the control of the operator and the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the requirement was based.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;546. Renewal</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Commencement of proceedings; public notice and participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A franchising authority may, on its own initiative during the 6-month period which begins with the 36th month before the franchise expiration, commence a proceeding which affords the public in the franchise area appropriate notice and participation for the purpose of (A) identifying the future cable-related community needs and interests, and (B) reviewing the performance of the cable operator under the franchise during the then current franchise term. If the cable operator submits, during such 6-month period, a written renewal notice requesting the commencement of such a proceeding, the franchising authority shall commence such a proceeding not later than 6 months after the date such notice is submitted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The cable operator may not invoke the renewal procedures set forth in subsections (b) through (g) of this section unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such a proceeding is requested by the cable operator by timely submission of such notice; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such a proceeding is commenced by the franchising authority on its own initiative.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Submission of renewal proposals; contents; time</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon completion of a proceeding under subsection (a) of this section, a cable operator seeking renewal of a franchise may, on its own initiative or at the request of a franchising authority, submit a proposal for renewal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to section 544 of this title, any such proposal shall contain such material as the franchising authority may require, including proposals for an upgrade of the cable system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The franchising authority may establish a date by which such proposal shall be submitted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice of proposal; renewal; preliminary assessment of nonrenewal; administrative review; issues; notice and opportunity for hearing; transcript; written decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon submittal by a cable operator of a proposal to the franchising authority for the renewal of a franchise pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the franchising authority shall provide prompt public notice of such proposal and, during the 4-month period which begins on the date of the submission of the cable operator's proposal pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, renew the franchise or, issue a preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed and, at the request of the operator or on its own initiative, commence an administrative proceeding, after providing prompt public notice of such proceeding, in accordance with paragraph (2) to consider whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the cable operator has substantially complied with the material terms of the existing franchise and with applicable law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the quality of the operator's service, including signal quality, response to consumer complaints, and billing practices, but without regard to the mix or quality of cable services or other services provided over the system, has been reasonable in light of community needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the operator has the financial, legal, and technical ability to provide the services, facilities, and equipment as set forth in the operator's proposal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the operator's proposal is reasonable to meet the future cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any proceeding under paragraph (1), the cable operator shall be afforded adequate notice and the cable operator and the franchise authority, or its designee, shall be afforded fair opportunity for full participation, including the right to introduce evidence (including evidence related to issues raised in the proceeding under subsection (a) of this section), to require the production of evidence, and to question witnesses. A transcript shall be made of any such proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) At the completion of a proceeding under this subsection, the franchising authority shall issue a written decision granting or denying the proposal for renewal based upon the record of such proceeding, and transmit a copy of such decision to the cable operator. Such decision shall state the reasons therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Basis for denial</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any denial of a proposal for renewal that has been submitted in compliance with subsection (b) of this section shall be based on one or more adverse findings made with respect to the factors described in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of subsection (c)(1) of this section, pursuant to the record of the proceeding under subsection (c) of this section. A franchising authority may not base a denial of renewal on a failure to substan<!-- PDFPage:245 -->tially comply with the material terms of the franchise under subsection (c)(1)(A) of this section or on events considered under subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section in any case in which a violation of the franchise or the events considered under subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section occur after the effective date of this subchapter unless the franchising authority has provided the operator with notice and the opportunity to cure, or in any case in which it is documented that the franchising authority has waived its right to object, or the cable operator gives written notice of a failure or inability to cure and the franchising authority fails to object within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Judicial review; grounds for relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any cable operator whose proposal for renewal has been denied by a final decision of a franchising authority made pursuant to this section, or has been adversely affected by a failure of the franchising authority to act in accordance with the procedural requirements of this section, may appeal such final decision or failure pursuant to the provisions of section 555 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The court shall grant appropriate relief if the court finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any action of the franchising authority, other than harmless error, is not in compliance with the procedural requirements of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the event of a final decision of the franchising authority denying the renewal proposal, the operator has demonstrated that the adverse finding of the franchising authority with respect to each of the factors described in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of subsection (c)(1) of this section on which the denial is based is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence, based on the record of the proceeding conducted under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Finality of administrative decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any decision of a franchising authority on a proposal for renewal shall not be considered final unless all administrative review by the State has occurred or the opportunity therefor has lapsed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) &ldquo;Franchise expiration&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;franchise expiration&rdquo; means the date of the expiration of the term of the franchise, as provided under the franchise, as it was in effect on October 30, 1984.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Alternative renewal procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) through (g) of this section, a cable operator may submit a proposal for the renewal of a franchise pursuant to this subsection at any time, and a franchising authority may, after affording the public adequate notice and opportunity for comment, grant or deny such proposal at any time (including after proceedings pursuant to this section have commenced). The provisions of subsections (a) through (g) of this section shall not apply to a decision to grant or deny a proposal under this subsection. The denial of a renewal pursuant to this subsection shall not affect action on a renewal proposal that is submitted in accordance with subsections (a) through (g) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Effect of renewal procedures upon action to revoke franchise for cause</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) through (h) of this section, any lawful action to revoke a cable operator's franchise for cause shall not be negated by the subsequent initiation of renewal proceedings by the cable operator under this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to promote the public interest, convenience, and necessity by increasing competition and diversity in the multichannel video programming market, to increase the availability of satellite cable programming and satellite broadcast programming to persons in rural and other areas not currently able to receive such programming, and to spur the development of communications technologies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for a cable operator, a satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable interest, or a satellite broadcast programming vendor to engage in unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices, the purpose or effect of which is to hinder significantly or to prevent any multichannel video programming distributor from providing satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming to subscribers or consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Regulations required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Proceeding required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall, in order to promote the public interest, convenience, and necessity by increasing competition and diversity in the multichannel video programming market and the continuing development of communications technologies, prescribe regulations to specify particular conduct that is prohibited by subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Minimum contents of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations to be promulgated under this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) establish effective safeguards to prevent a cable operator which has an attributable interest in a satellite cable programming vendor or a satellite broadcast programming vendor from unduly or improperly influencing the decision of such vendor to sell, or the prices, terms, and conditions of sale of, satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming to any unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) prohibit discrimination by a satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable interest or by a satellite broadcast programming vendor in the prices, terms, and conditions of sale or delivery of satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming among or between cable systems, cable operators, or other multichannel video programming distributors, or their agents or buying groups; except that such a satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable interest or such a satellite broadcast programming vendor shall not be prohibited from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) imposing reasonable requirements for creditworthiness, offering of service, and financial stability and standards regarding character and technical quality;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) establishing different prices, terms, and conditions to take into account actual and reasonable differences in the cost of creation, sale, delivery, or transmission of satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) establishing different prices, terms, and conditions which take into account economies of scale, cost savings, or other direct and legitimate economic benefits reasonably attributable to the number of subscribers served by the distributor; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) entering into an exclusive contract that is permitted under subparagraph (D);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) prohibit practices, understandings, arrangements, and activities, including exclusive contracts for satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming between a cable operator and a satellite cable programming vendor or satellite broadcast programming vendor, that prevent a multichannel video programming distributor from obtaining such programming from any satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable interest or any satellite broadcast programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable interest for distribution to persons in areas not served by a cable operator as of October 5, 1992; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:247 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) with respect to distribution to persons in areas served by a cable operator, prohibit exclusive contracts for satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming between a cable operator and a satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable interest or a satellite broadcast programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable interest, unless the Commission determines (in accordance with paragraph (4)) that such contract is in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Geographic limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this section shall require any person who is engaged in the national or regional distribution of video programming to make such programming available in any geographic area beyond which such programming has been authorized or licensed for distribution.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Applicability to satellite retransmissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this section shall apply (i) to the signal of any broadcast affiliate of a national television network or other television signal that is retransmitted by satellite but that is not satellite broadcast programming, or (ii) to any internal satellite communication of any broadcast network or cable network that is not satellite broadcast programming.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Public interest determinations on exclusive contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining whether an exclusive contract is in the public interest for purposes of paragraph (2)(D), the Commission shall consider each of the following factors with respect to the effect of such contract on the distribution of video programming in areas that are served by a cable operator:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the effect of such exclusive contract on the development of competition in local and national multichannel video programming distribution markets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the effect of such exclusive contract on competition from multichannel video programming distribution technologies other than cable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the effect of such exclusive contract on the attraction of capital investment in the production and distribution of new satellite cable programming;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the effect of such exclusive contract on diversity of programming in the multichannel video programming distribution market; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the duration of the exclusive contract.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Commercial consumer availability of equipment used to access services provided by multichannel video programming distributors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall, in consultation with appropriate industry standard-setting organizations, adopt regulations to assure the commercial availability, to consumers of multichannel video programming and other services offered over multichannel video programming systems, of converter boxes, interactive communications equipment, and other equipment used by consumers to access multichannel video programming and other services offered over multichannel video programming systems, from manufacturers, retailers, and other vendors not affiliated with any multichannel video programming distributor. Such regulations shall not prohibit any multichannel video programming distributor from also offering converter boxes, interactive communications equipment, and other equipment used by consumers to access multichannel video programming and other services offered over multichannel video programming systems, to consumers, if the system operator's charges to consumers for such devices and equipment are separately stated and not subsidized by charges for any such service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Protection of system security</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall not prescribe regulations under subsection (a) of this section which would jeopardize security of multichannel video programming and other services offered over multichannel video programming systems, or impede the legal rights of a provider of such services to prevent theft of service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall waive a regulation adopted under subsection (a) of this section for a limited time upon an appropriate showing by a provider of multichannel video programming and other services offered over multichannel video programming systems, or an equipment provider, that such waiver is necessary to assist the development or introduction of a new or improved multichannel video programming or other service offered over multichannel video programming systems, technology, or products. Upon an appropriate showing, the Commission shall grant any such waiver request within 90 days of any application filed under this subsection, and such waiver shall be effective for all service providers and products in that category and for all providers of services and products.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Avoidance of redundant regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commercial availability determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Determinations made or regulations prescribed by the Commission with respect to commercial availability to consumers of converter boxes, interactive communications equipment, and other equipment used by consumers to access multichannel video programming and other services offered over multichannel video programming systems, before February 8, 1996, shall fulfill the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section affects section 64.702(e) of the Commission's regulations (47 C.F.R. 64.702(e)) or other Commission regulations governing interconnection and competitive provision of customer premises equipment used in connection with basic common carrier communications services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Sunset</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The regulations adopted under this section shall cease to apply when the Commission determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the market for the multichannel video programming distributors is fully competitive;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the market for converter boxes, and interactive communications equipment, used in conjunction with that service is fully competitive; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) elimination of the regulations would promote competition and the public interest.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Entities within scope of coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall apply to any corporation, partnership, association, joint-stock company, or trust engaged primarily in the management or operation of any cable system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Discrimination prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Equal opportunity in employment shall be afforded by each entity specified in subsection (a) of this section, and no person shall be discriminated against in employment by such entity because of race, color, religion, national origin, age, or sex.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Equal opportunity programs; establishment; maintenance; execution; terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any entity specified in subsection (a) of this section shall establish, maintain, and execute a positive continuing program of specific practices designed to ensure equal opportunity in every aspect of its employment policies and practices. Under the terms of its program, each such entity shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) define the responsibility of each level of management to ensure a positive application and vigorous enforcement of its policy of equal opportunity, and establish a procedure to review and control managerial and supervisory performance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) inform its employees and recognized employee organizations of the equal employment opportunity policy and program and enlist their cooperation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) communicate its equal employment opportunity policy and program and its employment needs to sources of qualified applicants without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, age, or sex, and solicit their recruitment assistance on a continuing basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) conduct a continuing program to exclude every form of prejudice or discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, or sex, from its personnel policies and practices and working conditions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) conduct a continuing review of job structure and employment practices and adopt positive recruitment, training, job design, and other measures needed to ensure genuine equality of opportunity to participate fully in all its organizational units, occupations, and levels of responsibility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Revision of rules; required provisions; annual statistical report; notice and comment on amendments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 270 days after the date of enactment of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, and after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission shall prescribe revisions in the rules under this section in order to implement the amendments made to this section by such Act. Such revisions shall be designed to promote equality of employment opportunities for females and minorities in each of the job categories itemized in paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such rules shall specify the terms under which an entity specified in subsection (a) of this section shall, to the extent possible&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) disseminate its equal opportunity program to job applicants, employees, and those with whom it regularly does business;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) use minority organizations, organizations for women, media, educational institutions, and other potential sources of minority and female applicants, to supply referrals whenever jobs are available in its operation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) evaluate its employment profile and job turnover against the availability of minorities and women in its franchise area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) undertake to offer promotions of minorities and women to positions of greater responsibility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) encourage minority and female entrepreneurs to conduct business with all parts of its operation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) analyze the results of its efforts to recruit, hire, promote, and use the services of minorities and women and explain any difficulties encountered in implementing its equal employment opportunity program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Such rules also shall require an entity specified in subsection (a) of this section with more than 5 full-time employees to file with the Commission an annual statistical report identifying by race, sex, and job title the number of employees in each of the following full-time and part-time job categories:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Corporate officers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) General Manager.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Chief Technician.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) Managers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(viii) Professionals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ix) Technicians.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(xii) Skilled Craftspersons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(xiii) Semiskilled Operatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(xiv) Unskilled Laborers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(xv) Service Workers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The report required by subparagraph (A) shall be made on separate forms, provided by the Commission, for full-time and part-time employees. The Commission's rules shall sufficiently define the job categories listed in clauses (i) through (vi) of such subparagraph so as to ensure that only employees who are principal decisionmakers and who have supervisory authority are reported for such categories. The <!-- PDFPage:253 -->Commission shall adopt rules that define the job categories listed in clauses (vii) through (xv) in a manner that is consistent with the Commission policies in effect on June 1, 1990. The Commission shall prescribe the method by which entities shall be required to compute and report the number of minorities and women in the job categories listed in clauses (i) through (x) and the number of minorities and women in the job categories listed in clauses (i) through (xv) in proportion to the total number of qualified minorities and women in the relevant labor market. The report shall include information on hiring, promotion, and recruitment practices necessary for the Commission to evaluate the efforts of entities to comply with the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection. The report shall be available for public inspection at the entity's central location and at every location where 5 or more full-time employees are regularly assigned to work. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting the Commission from collecting or continuing to collect statistical or other employment information in a manner that it deems appropriate to carry out this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission may amend such rules from time to time to the extent necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. Any such amendment shall be made after notice and opportunity for comment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Annual certification of compliance; periodic investigation of employment practices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) On an annual basis, the Commission shall certify each entity described in subsection (a) of this section as in compliance with this section if, on the basis of information in the possession of the Commission, including the report filed pursuant to subsection (d)(3) of this section, such entity was in compliance, during the annual period involved, with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall, periodically but not less frequently than every five years, investigate the employment practices of each entity described in subsection (a) of this section, in the aggregate, as well as in individual job categories, and determine whether such entity is in compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, including whether such entity's employment practices deny or abridge women and minorities equal employment opportunities. As part of such investigation, the Commission shall review whether the entity's reports filed pursuant to subsection (d)(3) of this section accurately reflect employee responsibilities in the reported job classifications.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Substantial failure to comply; penalties; notice to public and franchising authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Commission finds after notice and hearing that the entity involved has willfully or repeatedly without good cause failed to comply with the requirements of this section, such failure shall constitute a substantial failure to comply with this subchapter. The failure to obtain certification under subsection (e) of this section shall not itself constitute the basis for a determination of substantial failure to comply with this title. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;repeatedly&rdquo;, when used with respect to failures to comply, refers to 3 or more failures during any 7-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any person who is determined by the Commission, through an investigation pursuant to subsection (e) of this section or otherwise, to have failed to meet or failed to make best efforts to meet the requirements of this section, or rules under this section, shall be liable to the United States for a forfeiture penalty of $500 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate offense. Any entity defined in subsection (a) of this section shall not be liable for more than 180 days of forfeitures which accrued prior to notification by the Commission of a potential violation. Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the forfeiture imposed on any person as a result of any violation that continues subsequent to such notification. In addition, any person liable for such penalty may also have any license under this chapter for cable auxiliary relay service suspended until the Commission determines that the failure involved has been corrected. Whoever knowingly makes any false statement or submits documentation which he knows to be false, pursuant to an application for certification under this section shall be in violation of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4), and the last 2 sentences of paragraph (2), of section 503(b) of this title shall apply to forfeitures under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission shall provide for notice to the public and appropriate franchising authorities of any penalty imposed under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Discrimination complaints; investigation; enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Employees or applicants for employment who believe they have been discriminated against in violation of the requirements of this section, or rules under this section, or any other interested person, may file a complaint with the Commission. A complaint by any such person shall be in writing, and shall be signed and sworn to by that person. The regulations under subsection (d)(1) of this section shall specify a program, under authorities otherwise available to the Commission, for the investigation of complaints and violations, and for the enforcement of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) &ldquo;Cable operator&rdquo; defined; owners of multiple unit dwellings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;cable operator&rdquo; includes any operator of any satellite master antenna television system, including a system described in section 522(7)(A) of this title and any multichannel video programming distributor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such term does not include any operator of a system which, in the aggregate, serves fewer than 50 subscribers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any case in which a cable operator is the owner of a multiple unit dwelling, the requirements of this section shall only apply to such cable operator with respect to its employees who are primarily engaged in cable telecommunications.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:254 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Regulatory powers of States and franchising authorities; nonexclusive nature of remedies and enforcement provisions; covered franchises</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of any State or any franchising authority&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to establish or enforce any requirement which is consistent with the requirements of this section, including any requirement which affords equal employment opportunity protection for employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to establish or enforce any provision requiring or encouraging any cable operator to conduct business with enterprises which are owned or controlled by members of minority groups (as defined in section 309(i)(3)(C)(ii) of this title) or which have their principal operations located within the community served by the cable operator; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to enforce any requirement of a franchise in effect on the effective date of this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The remedies and enforcement provisions of this section are in addition to, and not in lieu of, those available under this or any other law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of this section shall apply to any cable operator, whether operating pursuant to a franchise granted before, on, or after October 30, 1984.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Open video systems</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Certificates of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local exchange carrier may provide cable service to its cable service subscribers in its telephone service area through an open video system that complies with this section. To the extent permitted by such regulations as the Commission may prescribe consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, an operator of a cable system or any other person may provide video programming through an open video system that complies with this section. An operator of an open video system shall qualify for reduced regulatory burdens under subsection (c) of this section if the operator of such system certifies to the Commission that such carrier complies with the Commission's regulations under subsection (b) of this section and the Commission approves such certification. The Commission shall publish notice of the receipt of any such certification and shall act to approve or disapprove any such certification within 10 days after receipt of such certification.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Dispute resolution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall have the authority to resolve disputes under this section and the regulations prescribed thereunder. Any such dispute shall be resolved within 180 days after notice of such dispute is submitted to the Commission. At that time or subsequently in a separate damages proceeding, the Commission may, in the case of any violation of this section, require carriage, award damages to any person denied carriage, or any combination of such sanctions. Any aggrieved party may seek any other remedy available under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Commission actions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Regulations required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 6 months after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall complete all actions necessary (including any reconsideration) to prescribe regulations that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) except as required pursuant to section 531, 534, or 535 of this title, prohibit an operator of an open video system from discriminating among video programming providers with regard to carriage on its open video system, and ensure that the rates, terms, and conditions for such carriage are just and reasonable, and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if demand exceeds the channel capacity of the open video system, prohibit an operator of an open video system and its affiliates from selecting the video programming services for carriage on more than one-third of the activated channel capacity on such system, but nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to limit the number of channels that the carrier and its affiliates may offer to provide directly to subscribers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) permit an operator of an open video system to carry on only one channel any video programming service that is offered by more than one video programming provider (including the local exchange carrier's video programming affiliate): <em>Provided</em>, That subscribers have ready and immediate access to any such video programming service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) extend to the distribution of video programming over open video systems the Commission's regulations concerning sports exclusivity (47 C.F.R. 76.67), network nonduplication (47 C.F.R. 76.92 et seq.), and syndicated exclusivity (47 C.F.R. 76.151 et seq.); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E)(i) prohibit an operator of an open video system from unreasonably discriminating in favor of the operator or its affiliates with regard to material or information (including advertising) provided by the operator to subscribers for the purposes of selecting programming on the open video system, or in the way such material or information is presented to subscribers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) require an operator of an open video system to ensure that video programming providers or copyright holders (or both) are able suitably and uniquely to identify their programming services to subscribers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) if such identification is transmitted as part of the programming signal, require the carrier to transmit such identification without change or alteration; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) prohibit an operator of an open video system from omitting television broadcast stations or other unaffiliated video programming services carried on such system from any navigational device, guide, or menu.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consumer access</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the requirements of paragraph (1) and the regulations thereunder, nothing in this section prohibits a common carrier or its affiliate from negotiating mutually agreeable terms and conditions with over-the-air broadcast stations and other unaffiliated video programming providers to allow consumer access to their signals on any level or screen of any gateway, menu, or other program guide, whether provided by the carrier or its affiliate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reduced regulatory burdens for open video systems</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any provision that applies to a cable operator under&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">to any operator of an open video system for which the Commission has approved a certification under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Implementation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Commission action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the rulemaking proceeding to prescribe the regulations required by subsection (b)(1) of this section, the Commission shall, to the extent possible, impose obligations that are no greater or lesser than the obligations contained in the provisions described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection. The Commission shall complete all action (including any reconsideration) to prescribe such regulations no later than 6 months after February 8, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An operator of an open video system under this part may be subject to the payment of fees on the gross revenues of the operator for the provision of cable service imposed by a local franchising authority or other governmental entity, in lieu of the franchise fees permitted under section 542 of this title. The rate at which such fees are imposed shall not exceed the rate at which franchise fees are imposed on any cable operator transmitting video programming in the franchise area, as determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission. An operator of an open video system may designate that portion of a subscriber's bill attributable to the fee under this subparagraph as a separate item on the bill.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulatory streamlining</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to the establishment and operation of an open video system, the requirements of this section shall apply in lieu of, and not in addition to, the requirements of subchapter II of this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this chapter precludes a video programming provider making use of an open video system from being treated as an operator of a cable system for purposes of section 111 of title 17.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Telephone service area&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;telephone service area&rdquo; when used in connection with a common carrier subject in whole or in part to subchapter II of this chapter means the area within which such carrier is offering telephone exchange service.</p>
