<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the notice to the committees containing the plan required by subsection (d)(2)(B) of this section shall be not less than 45 days prior to the date of the transfer that causes such excess above 10 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) such notice shall include, in addition to such plan, an explanation of need for such subsequent transfer or transfers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the Comptroller General shall, within 30 days after receiving such plan, review such plan and submit to such committees an assessment of the explanation for the subsequent transfer or transfers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
