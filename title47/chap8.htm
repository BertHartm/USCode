<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, within 18 months after August 10, 1993, and within 6 months after August 5, 1997, prepare and submit to the President and the Congress a report identifying and recommending for reallocation bands of frequencies&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that are allocated on a primary basis for Federal Government use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that are not required for the present or identifiable future needs of the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that can feasibly be made available, as of the date of submission of the report or at any time during the next 15 years, for use under the 1934 Act [47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.] (other than for Federal Government stations under section 305 of the 1934 Act [47 U.S.C. 305]);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the transfer of which (from Federal Government use) will not result in costs to the Federal Government, or losses of services or benefits to the public, that are excessive in relation to the benefits to the public that may be provided by non-Federal licensees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) that are most likely to have the greatest potential for productive uses and public benefits under the 1934 Act [47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.] if allocated for non-Federal use.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Minimum amount of spectrum recommended</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Initial reallocation report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In accordance with the provisions of this section, the Secretary shall recommend for reallocation in the initial report required by subsection (a) of this section, for use other than by Federal Government stations under section 305 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 305), bands of frequencies that in the aggregate span not less than 200 megahertz, that are located below 5 gigahertz, and that meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (1) through (5) of subsection (a) of this section. Such bands of frequencies shall include bands of frequencies, located below 3 gigahertz, that span in the aggregate not less than 100 megahertz.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Mixed uses permitted to be counted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Bands of frequencies which a report of the Secretary under subsection (a) or (d)(1) of this section recommends be partially retained for use by Federal Government stations, but which are also recommended to be reallocated to be made available under the 1934 Act [47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.] for use by non-Federal stations, may be counted toward the minimum spectrum required by paragraph (1) or (3) of this subsection, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the bands of frequencies counted under this paragraph may not count toward more than one-half of the minimums required by paragraph (1) or (3) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a band of frequencies may not be counted under this paragraph unless the assignments of the band to Federal Government stations under section 305 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 305) are limited by geographic area, by time, or by other means so as to guarantee that the potential use to be made by such Federal Government stations is substantially less (as measured by geographic area, time, or otherwise) than the potential use to be made by non-Federal stations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the operational sharing permitted under this paragraph shall be subject to the interference regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section 305(a) of the 1934 Act [47 U.S.C. 305(a)] and to coordination procedures that the Commission and the Secretary shall jointly establish and implement to ensure against harmful interference.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Second reallocation report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In accordance with the provisions of this section, the Secretary shall recommend for reallocation in the second report required by subsection (a) of this section, for use other than by Federal Government stations under section 305 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 305), a band or bands of frequencies that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the aggregate span not less than 12 megahertz;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) are located below 3 gigahertz; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Criteria for identification</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Needs of the Federal Government</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining whether a band of frequencies meets the criteria specified in subsection (a)(2) of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) consider whether the band of frequencies is used to provide a communications service that is or could be available from a commercial provider or other vendor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) seek to promote&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the maximum practicable reliance on commercially available substitutes;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:308 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the sharing of frequencies (as permitted under subsection (b)(2) of this section);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the development and use of new communications technologies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the use of nonradiating communications systems where practicable; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) seek to avoid&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) serious degradation of Federal Government services and operations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) excessive costs to the Federal Government and users of Federal Government services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) excessive disruption of existing use of Federal Government frequencies by amateur radio licensees.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Feasibility of use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining whether a frequency band meets the criteria specified in subsection (a)(3) of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) assume that the frequency will be assigned by the Commission under section 303 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 303) within 15 years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) assume reasonable rates of scientific progress and growth of demand for telecommunications services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) seek to include frequencies which can be used to stimulate the development of new technologies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) consider the immediate and recurring costs to reestablish services displaced by the reallocation of spectrum.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Analysis of benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining whether a band of frequencies meets the criteria specified in subsection (a)(5) of this section, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the extent to which equipment is or will be available that is capable of utilizing the band;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the proximity of frequencies that are already assigned for commercial or other non-Federal use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the extent to which, in general, commercial users could share the frequency with amateur radio licensees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the activities of foreign governments in making frequencies available for experimentation or commercial assignments in order to support their domestic manufacturers of equipment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Power agency frequencies</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Applicability of criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The criteria specified by subsection (a) of this section shall be deemed not to be met for any purpose under this subchapter with regard to any frequency assignment to, or any frequency assignment used by, a Federal power agency for the purpose of withdrawing that assignment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Mixed use eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The frequencies assigned to any Federal power agency may only be eligible for mixed use under subsection (b)(2) of this section in geographically separate areas, but in those cases where a frequency is to be shared by an affected Federal power agency and a non-Federal user, such use by the non-Federal user shall not cause harmful interference to the affected Federal power agency or adversely affect the reliability of its power system.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) &ldquo;Federal power agency&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">As used in this paragraph, the term &ldquo;Federal power agency&rdquo; means the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Bonneville Power Administration, the Western Area Power Administration, the Southwestern Power Administration, the Southeastern Power Administration, or the Alaska Power Administration.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Limitation on reallocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">None of the frequencies recommended for reallocation in the reports required by this subsection shall have been recommended, prior to August 10, 1993, for reallocation to non-Federal use by international agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Procedure for identification of reallocable bands of frequencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Submission of preliminary identification to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 6 months after August 10, 1993, the Secretary shall prepare, make publicly available, and submit to the President, the Congress, and the Commission a report which makes a preliminary identification of reallocable bands of frequencies which meet the criteria established by this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Public comment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall provide interested persons with the opportunity to submit, within 90 days after the date of its publication, written comment on the preliminary report required by paragraph (1). The Secretary shall immediately transmit a copy of any such comment to the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Comment and recommendations from Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall, within 90 days after the conclusion of the period for comment provided pursuant to paragraph (2), submit to the Secretary the Commission's analysis of such comments and the Commission's recommendations for responses to such comments, together with such other comments and recommendations as the Commission deems appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Direct discussions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall encourage and provide opportunity for direct discussions among commercial representatives and Federal Government users of the spectrum to aid the Secretary in determining which frequencies to recommend for reallocation. The Secretary shall provide notice to the public and the Commission of any such discussions, including the name or names of any businesses or other persons represented in such discussions. A representative of the Commission (and of the Secretary at the election of the Secretary) shall be permitted to attend any such discussions. The Secretary shall provide the public and the Commission with an opportunity to comment on the results of any such discussions prior to the submission of the initial report required by subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Timetable required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall, as part of the reports required by subsections (a) and (d)(1) of this section, include a timetable that recommends effective dates by which the President shall withdraw or limit assignments of the frequencies specified in such reports.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Expedited reallocation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Required reallocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall, as part of the report required by subsection (d)(1) of this section, specifically identify and recommend for immediate reallocation bands of frequencies that in the aggregate span not less than 50 megahertz, that meet the criteria described in subsection (a) of this section, and that can be made available for reallocation immediately upon issuance of the report required by subsection (d)(1) of this section. Such bands of frequencies shall include bands of frequencies, located below 3 gigahertz, that in the aggregate span not less than 25 megahertz.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Permitted reallocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may, as part of such report, identify and recommend bands of frequencies for immediate reallocation for a mixed use pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of this section, but such bands of frequencies may not count toward the minimums required by subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Delayed effective dates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In setting the recommended delayed effective dates, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) consider the need to reallocate bands of frequencies as early as possible, taking into account the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 925(b) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) be based on the useful remaining life of equipment that has been purchased or contracted for to operate on identified frequencies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) consider the need to coordinate frequency use with other nations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) take into account the relationship between the costs to the Federal Government of changing to different frequencies and the benefits that may be obtained from commercial and other non-Federal uses of the reassigned frequencies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Additional reallocation report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary receives a notice from the Commission pursuant to section 3002(c)(5) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Secretary shall prepare and submit to the President, the Commission, and the Congress a report recommending for reallocation for use other than by Federal Government stations under section 305 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 305), bands of frequencies that are suitable for the licensees identified in the Commission's notice. The Commission shall, not later than one year after receipt of such report, prepare, submit to the President and the Congress, and implement, a plan for the immediate allocation and assignment of such frequencies under the 1934 Act [47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.] to incumbent licensees described in the Commission's notice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Relocation of Federal Government stations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Eligible Federal entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any Federal entity that operates a Federal Government station assigned to a band of frequencies specified in paragraph (2) and that incurs relocation costs because of the reallocation of frequencies from Federal use to non-Federal use shall receive payment for such costs from the Spectrum Relocation Fund, in accordance with section 928 of this title. For purposes of this paragraph, Federal power agencies exempted under subsection (c)(4) of this section that choose to relocate from the frequencies identified for reallocation pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, are eligible to receive payment under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible frequencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The bands of eligible frequencies for purposes of this section are as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the 216&ndash;220 megahertz band, the 1432&ndash;1435 megahertz band, the 1710&ndash;1755 megahertz band, and the 2385&ndash;2390 megahertz band of frequencies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any other band of frequencies reallocated from Federal use to non-Federal use after January 1, 2003, that is assigned by competitive bidding pursuant to section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)), except for bands of frequencies previously identified by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration in the Spectrum Reallocation Final Report, NTIA Special Publication 95&ndash;32 (1995).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Definition of relocation costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;relocation costs&rdquo; means the costs incurred by a Federal entity to achieve comparable capability of systems, regardless of whether that capability is achieved by relocating to a new frequency assignment or by utilizing an alternative technology. Such costs include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the costs of any modification or replacement of equipment, software, facilities, operating manuals, training costs, or regulations that are attributable to relocation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the costs of all engineering, equipment, software, site acquisition and construction costs, as well as any legitimate and prudent transaction expense, including outside consultants, and reasonable additional costs incurred by the Federal entity that are attributable to relocation, including increased recurring costs associated with the replacement facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the costs of engineering studies, economic analyses, or other expenses reasonably incurred in calculating the estimated relocation costs that are provided to the Commission pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the one-time costs of any modification of equipment reasonably necessary to accommodate commercial use of such frequencies prior to the termination of the Federal entity's primary allocation or protected status, when the eligible frequencies as de<!-- PDFPage:310 -->fined in paragraph (2) of this subsection are made available for private sector uses by competitive bidding and a Federal entity retains primary allocation or protected status in those frequencies for a period of time after the completion of the competitive bidding process; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the costs associated with the accelerated replacement of systems and equipment if such acceleration is necessary to ensure the timely relocation of systems to a new frequency assignment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Notice to Commission of estimated relocation costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Commission shall notify the NTIA at least 18 months prior to the commencement of any auction of eligible frequencies defined in paragraph (2). At least 6 months prior to the commencement of any such auction, the NTIA, on behalf of the Federal entities and after review by the Office of Management and Budget, shall notify the Commission of estimated relocation costs and timelines for such relocation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Upon timely request of a Federal entity, the NTIA shall provide such entity with information regarding an alternative frequency assignment or assignments to which their radiocommunications operations could be relocated for purposes of calculating the estimated relocation costs and timelines to be submitted to the Commission pursuant to subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) To the extent practicable and consistent with national security considerations, the NTIA shall provide the information required by subparagraphs (A) and (B) by the geographic location of the Federal entities&rsquo; facilities or systems and the frequency bands used by such facilities or systems.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Notice to congressional committees and GAO</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The NTIA shall, at the time of providing an initial estimate of relocation costs to the Commission under paragraph (4)(A), submit to&nbsp;<sup><a href="#923_1_target" name="923_1">1</a></sup> Committees on Appropriations and Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives for approval, to the Committees on Appropriations and Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate for approval, and to the Comptroller General a copy of such estimate and the timelines for relocation. Unless disapproved within 30 days, the estimate shall be approved. If disapproved, the NTIA may resubmit a revised initial estimate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Implementation of procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The NTIA shall take such actions as necessary to ensure the timely relocation of Federal entities&rsquo; spectrum-related operations from frequencies defined in paragraph (2) to frequencies or facilities of comparable capability. Upon a finding by the NTIA that a Federal entity has achieved comparable capability of systems by relocating to a new frequency assignment or by utilizing an alternative technology, the NTIA shall terminate the entity's authorization and notify the Commission that the entity's relocation has been completed. The NTIA shall also terminate such entity's authorization if the NTIA determines that the entity has unreasonably failed to comply with the timeline for relocation submitted by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget under section 928(d)(2)(B) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Federal action to expedite spectrum transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any Federal Government station which operates on electromagnetic spectrum that has been identified in any reallocation report under this section shall, to the maximum extent practicable through the use of the authority granted under subsection (g) of this section and any other applicable provision of law, take action to relocate its spectrum use to other frequencies that are reserved for Federal use or to consolidate its spectrum use with other Federal Government stations in a manner that maximizes the spectrum available for non-Federal use.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) &ldquo;Federal entity&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;Federal entity&rdquo; means any department, agency, or other instrumentality of the Federal Government that utilizes a Government station license obtained under section 305 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 305).</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;317, &sect;2, Dec. 4, 2002, 116 Stat. 2766, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the World Wide Web presents a stimulating and entertaining opportunity for children to learn, grow, and develop educationally and intellectually;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Internet technology also makes available an extensive amount of information that is harmful to children, as studies indicate that a significant portion of all material available on the Internet is related to pornography;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) young children, when trying to use the World Wide Web for positive purposes, are often presented&mdash;either mistakenly or intentionally&mdash;with material that is inappropriate for their age, which can be extremely frustrating for children, parents, and educators;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) exposure of children to material that is inappropriate for them, including pornography, can distort the education and development of the Nation's youth and represents a serious harm to American families that can lead to a host of other problems for children, including inappropriate use of chat rooms, physical molestation, harassment, and legal and financial difficulties;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) young boys and girls, older teens, troubled youth, frequent Internet users, chat room participants, online risk takers, and those who communicate online with strangers are at greater risk for receiving unwanted sexual solicitation on the Internet;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) studies have shown that 19 percent of youth (ages 10 to 17) who used the Internet regularly were the targets of unwanted sexual solicitation, but less than 10 percent of the solicitations were reported to the police;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) children who come across illegal content should report it to the congressionally authorized CyberTipline, an online mechanism developed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, for citizens to report sexual crimes against children;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) the CyberTipline has received more than 64,400 reports, including reports of child pornography, online enticement for sexual acts, child molestation (outside the family), and child prostitution;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) although the computer software and hardware industries, and other related industries, have developed innovative ways to help parents and educators restrict material that is harmful to minors through parental control protections and self-regulation, to date such efforts have not provided a national solution to the problem of minors accessing harmful material on the World Wide Web;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) the creation of a &lsquo;green-light&rsquo; area within the United States country code Internet domain, that will contain only content that is appropriate for children under the age of 13, is analogous to the creation of a children's section within a library and will promote the positive experiences of children and families in the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) while custody, care, and nurture of the child reside first with the parent, the protection of the physical and psychological well-being of minors by shielding them from material that is harmful to them is a compelling governmental interest.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 2002 Amendment note set out under section 901 of this title] are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to facilitate the creation of a second-level domain within the United States country code Internet domain for the location of material that is suitable for minors and not harmful to minors; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to ensure that the National Telecommunications and Information Administration oversees the creation of such a second-level domain and ensures the effective and efficient establishment and operation of the new domain.&rdquo;</p>
