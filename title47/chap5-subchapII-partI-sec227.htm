<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the notice is clear and conspicuous and on the first page of the unsolicited advertisement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the notice states that the recipient may make a request to the sender of the unsolicited advertisement not to send any future unsolicited advertisements to a telephone facsimile machine or machines and that failure to comply, within the shortest reasonable time, as determined by the Commission, with such a request meeting the requirements under subparagraph (E) is unlawful;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the notice includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) a domestic contact telephone and facsimile machine number for the recipient to transmit such a request to the sender; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) a cost-free mechanism for a recipient to transmit a request pursuant to such notice to the sender of the unsolicited advertisement; the Commission shall by rule require the sender to provide such a mechanism and may, in the discretion of the Commission and subject to such conditions as the Commission may prescribe, exempt certain classes of small business senders, but only if the Commission determines that the costs to such class are unduly burdensome given the revenues generated by such small businesses;</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) by regulation issued after public notice and opportunity for public comment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the Commission determines that such notice required by paragraph (1)(C)(iii) is not necessary to protect the ability of the members of such associations to stop such associations from sending any future unsolicited advertisements; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Protection of subscriber privacy rights</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Rulemaking proceeding required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 120 days after December 20, 1991, the Commission shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding concerning the need to protect residential telephone subscribers&rsquo; privacy rights to avoid receiving telephone solicitations to which they object. The proceeding shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) compare and evaluate alternative methods and procedures (including the use of electronic databases, telephone network technologies, special directory markings, industry-based or company-specific &ldquo;do not call&rdquo; systems, and any other alternatives, individually or in combination) for their effectiveness in protecting such privacy rights, and in terms of their cost and other advantages and disadvantages;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) evaluate the categories of public and private entities that would have the capacity to establish and administer such methods and procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) consider whether different methods and procedures may apply for local telephone solicitations, such as local telephone solicitations of small businesses or holders of second class mail permits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) consider whether there is a need for additional Commission authority to further restrict telephone solicitations, including those calls exempted under subsection (a)(3) of this section, and, if such a finding is made and supported by the record, propose specific restrictions to the Congress; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) develop proposed regulations to implement the methods and procedures that the Commission determines are most effective and efficient to accomplish the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 9 months after December 20, 1991, the Commission shall conclude the rule<!-- PDFPage:74 -->making proceeding initiated under paragraph (1) and shall prescribe regulations to implement methods and procedures for protecting the privacy rights described in such paragraph in an efficient, effective, and economic manner and without the imposition of any additional charge to telephone subscribers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Use of database permitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations required by paragraph (2) may require the establishment and operation of a single national database to compile a list of telephone numbers of residential subscribers who object to receiving telephone solicitations, and to make that compiled list and parts thereof available for purchase. If the Commission determines to require such a database, such regulations shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) specify a method by which the Commission will select an entity to administer such database;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) require each common carrier providing telephone exchange service, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission, to inform subscribers for telephone exchange service of the opportunity to provide notification, in accordance with regulations established under this paragraph, that such subscriber objects to receiving telephone solicitations;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) specify the methods by which such objections shall be collected and added to the database;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) prohibit any person from making or transmitting a telephone solicitation to the telephone number of any subscriber included in such database;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) specify (i) the methods by which any person desiring to make or transmit telephone solicitations will obtain access to the database, by area code or local exchange prefix, as required to avoid calling the telephone numbers of subscribers included in such database; and (ii) the costs to be recovered from such persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) specify the methods for recovering, from persons accessing such database, the costs involved in identifying, collecting, updating, disseminating, and selling, and other activities relating to, the operations of the database that are incurred by the entities carrying out those activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) specify the frequency with which such database will be updated and specify the method by which such updating will take effect for purposes of compliance with the regulations prescribed under this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) be designed to enable States to use the database mechanism selected by the Commission for purposes of administering or enforcing State law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(K) prohibit the use of such database for any purpose other than compliance with the requirements of this section and any such State law and specify methods for protection of the privacy rights of persons whose numbers are included in such database; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(L) require each common carrier providing services to any person for the purpose of making telephone solicitations to notify such person of the requirements of this section and the regulations thereunder.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Considerations required for use of database method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission determines to require the database mechanism described in paragraph (3), the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in developing procedures for gaining access to the database, consider the different needs of telemarketers conducting business on a national, regional, State, or local level;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) develop a fee schedule or price structure for recouping the cost of such database that recognizes such differences and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) reflect the relative costs of providing a national, regional, State, or local list of phone numbers of subscribers who object to receiving telephone solicitations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) reflect the relative costs of providing such lists on paper or electronic media; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) not place an unreasonable financial burden on small businesses; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) consider (i) whether the needs of telemarketers operating on a local basis could be met through special markings of area white pages directories, and (ii) if such directories are needed as an adjunct to database lists prepared by area code and local exchange prefix.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Private right of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person who has received more than one telephone call within any 12-month period by or on behalf of the same entity in violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State bring in an appropriate court of that State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an action based on a violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin such violation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation, or to receive up to $500 in damages for each such violation, whichever is greater, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) both such actions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">It shall be an affirmative defense in any action brought under this paragraph that the defendant has established and implemented, with due care, reasonable practices and procedures to effectively prevent telephone solicitations in violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection. If the court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated the regulations prescribed under this subsection, the court may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount available under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:75 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Relation to subsection (b)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to permit a communication prohibited by subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Technical and procedural standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It shall be unlawful for any person within the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to initiate any communication using a telephone facsimile machine, or to make any telephone call using any automatic telephone dialing system, that does not comply with the technical and procedural standards prescribed under this subsection, or to use any telephone facsimile machine or automatic telephone dialing system in a manner that does not comply with such standards; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to use a computer or other electronic device to send any message via a telephone facsimile machine unless such person clearly marks, in a margin at the top or bottom of each transmitted page of the message or on the first page of the transmission, the date and time it is sent and an identification of the business, other entity, or individual sending the message and the telephone number of the sending machine or of such business, other entity, or individual.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Telephone facsimile machines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall revise the regulations setting technical and procedural standards for telephone facsimile machines to require that any such machine which is manufactured after one year after December 20, 1991, clearly marks, in a margin at the top or bottom of each transmitted page or on the first page of each transmission, the date and time sent, an identification of the business, other entity, or individual sending the message, and the telephone number of the sending machine or of such business, other entity, or individual.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Artificial or prerecorded voice systems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall prescribe technical and procedural standards for systems that are used to transmit any artificial or prerecorded voice message via telephone. Such standards shall require that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) all artificial or prerecorded telephone messages (i) shall, at the beginning of the message, state clearly the identity of the business, individual, or other entity initiating the call, and (ii) shall, during or after the message, state clearly the telephone number or address of such business, other entity, or individual; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any such system will automatically release the called party's line within 5 seconds of the time notification is transmitted to the system that the called party has hung up, to allow the called party's line to be used to make or receive other calls.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect on State law</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) State law not preempted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except for the standards prescribed under subsection (d) of this section and subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, nothing in this section or in the regulations prescribed under this section shall preempt any State law that imposes more restrictive intrastate requirements or regulations on, or which prohibits&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the use of telephone facsimile machines or other electronic devices to send unsolicited advertisements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the use of automatic telephone dialing systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the use of artificial or prerecorded voice messages; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the making of telephone solicitations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) State use of databases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, pursuant to subsection (c)(3) of this section, the Commission requires the establishment of a single national database of telephone numbers of subscribers who object to receiving telephone solicitations, a State or local authority may not, in its regulation of telephone solicitations, require the use of any database, list, or listing system that does not include the part of such single national database that relates to such State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Actions by States</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority of States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the attorney general of a State, or an official or agency designated by a State, has reason to believe that any person has engaged or is engaging in a pattern or practice of telephone calls or other transmissions to residents of that State in violation of this section or the regulations prescribed under this section, the State may bring a civil action on behalf of its residents to enjoin such calls, an action to recover for actual monetary loss or receive $500 in damages for each violation, or both such actions. If the court finds the defendant willfully or knowingly violated such regulations, the court may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount available under the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exclusive jurisdiction of Federal courts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The district courts of the United States, the United States courts of any territory, and the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all civil actions brought under this subsection. Upon proper application, such courts shall also have jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus, or orders affording like relief, commanding the defendant to comply with the provisions of this section or regulations prescribed under this section, including the requirement that the defendant take such action as is necessary to remove the danger of such violation. Upon a proper showing, a permanent or temporary injunction or restraining order shall be granted without bond.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Rights of Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State shall serve prior written notice of any such civil action upon the Commission and provide the Commission with a copy of its complaint, except in any case where such prior notice is not feasible, in which case the State shall serve such notice immediately upon in<!-- PDFPage:76 -->stituting such action. The Commission shall have the right (A) to intervene in the action, (B) upon so intervening, to be heard on all matters arising therein, and (C) to file petitions for appeal.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Venue; service of process</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Investigatory powers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of bringing any civil action under this subsection, nothing in this section shall prevent the attorney general of a State, or an official or agency designated by a State, from exercising the powers conferred on the attorney general or such official by the laws of such State to conduct investigations or to administer oaths or affirmations or to compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of documentary and other evidence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Effect on State court proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit an authorized State official from proceeding in State court on the basis of an alleged violation of any general civil or criminal statute of such State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Commission has instituted a civil action for violation of regulations prescribed under this section, no State may, during the pendency of such action instituted by the Commission, subsequently institute a civil action against any defendant named in the Commission's complaint for any violation as alleged in the Commission's complaint.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) &ldquo;Attorney general&rdquo; defined</h4>

<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Statement of Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 2 of Pub. L. 102&ndash;243 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The use of the telephone to market goods and services to the home and other businesses is now pervasive due to the increased use of cost-effective telemarketing techniques.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Over 30,000 businesses actively telemarket goods and services to business and residential customers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) More than 300,000 solicitors call more than 18,000,000 Americans every day.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Total United States sales generated through telemarketing amounted to $435,000,000,000 in 1990, a more than four-fold increase since 1984.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Unrestricted telemarketing, however, can be an intrusive invasion of privacy and, when an emergency or medical assistance telephone line is seized, a risk to public safety.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Many consumers are outraged over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance calls to their homes from telemarketers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Over half the States now have statutes restricting various uses of the telephone for marketing, but telemarketers can evade their prohibitions through interstate operations; therefore, Federal law is needed to control residential telemarketing practices.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The Constitution does not prohibit restrictions on commercial telemarketing solicitations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Individuals&rsquo; privacy rights, public safety interests, and commercial freedoms of speech and trade must be balanced in a way that protects the privacy of individuals and permits legitimate telemarketing practices.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Evidence compiled by the Congress indicates that residential telephone subscribers consider automated or prerecorded telephone calls, regardless of the content or the initiator of the message, to be a nuisance and an invasion of privacy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Technologies that might allow consumers to avoid receiving such calls are not universally available, are costly, are unlikely to be enforced, or place an inordinate burden on the consumer.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Banning such automated or prerecorded telephone calls to the home, except when the receiving party consents to receiving the call or when such calls are necessary in an emergency situation affecting the health and safety of the consumer, is the only effective means of protecting telephone consumers from this nuisance and privacy invasion.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) While the evidence presented to the Congress indicates that automated or prerecorded calls are a nuisance and an invasion of privacy, regardless of the type of call, the Federal Communications Commission should have the flexibility to design different rules for those types of automated or prerecorded calls that it finds are not considered a nuisance or invasion of privacy, or for noncommercial calls, consistent with the free speech protections embodied in the First Amendment of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Businesses also have complained to the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission that automated or prerecorded telephone calls are a nuisance, are an invasion of privacy, and interfere with interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) The Federal Communications Commission should consider adopting reasonable restrictions on automated or prerecorded calls to businesses as well as to the home, consistent with the constitutional protections of free speech.&rdquo;</p>
