<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) False distress signals; rebroadcasting programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No person within the jurisdiction of the United States shall knowingly utter or transmit, or cause to be uttered or transmitted, any false or fraudulent signal of distress, or communication relating thereto, nor shall any broadcasting station rebroadcast the program or any part thereof of another broadcasting station without the express authority of the originating station.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Consent to retransmission of broadcasting station signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Following the date that is one year after October 5, 1992, no cable system or other multichannel video programming distributor shall retransmit the signal of a broadcasting station, or any part thereof, except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) with the express authority of the originating station; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) pursuant to section 534 of this title, in the case of a station electing, in accordance with this subsection, to assert the right to carriage under such section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) retransmission of the signal of a noncommercial broadcasting station;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) retransmission directly to a home satellite antenna of the signal of a broadcasting station that is not owned or operated by, or affiliated with, a broadcasting network, if such signal was retransmitted by a satellite carrier on May 1, 1991;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) retransmission of the signal of a broadcasting station that is owned or operated by, or affiliated with, a broadcasting network directly to a home satellite antenna, if the household receiving the signal is an unserved household; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) retransmission by a cable operator or other multichannel video programming distributor of the signal of a superstation if such signal was obtained from a satellite carrier and the originating station was a superstation on May 1, 1991.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this paragraph, the terms &ldquo;satellite carrier&rdquo;, &ldquo;superstation&rdquo;, and &ldquo;unserved household&rdquo; have the meanings given those terms, respectively, in section 119(d) of title 17 as in effect on October 5, 1992.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Within 45 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall commence a rulemaking proceeding to establish regulations to govern the exercise by television broadcast stations of the right to grant retransmission consent under this subsection and of the right to signal carriage under section 534 of this title, and such other regulations as are necessary to administer the limitations contained in paragraph (2). The Commission shall consider in such proceeding the impact that the grant of retransmission consent by television stations may have on the rates for the basic service tier and shall ensure that the regulations prescribed under this subsection do not conflict with the Commission's obligation under section 543(b)(1) of this title to ensure that the rates for the basic service tier are reasonable. Such rulemaking proceeding shall be completed within 180 days after October 5, 1992.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The regulations required by subparagraph (A) shall require that television stations, within one year after October 5, 1992, and every three years thereafter, make an election between the right to grant retransmission consent under this subsection and the right to signal carriage under section 534 of this title. If there is more than one cable system which services the same geographic area, a station's election shall apply to all such cable systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If an originating television station elects under paragraph (3)(B) to exercise its right to grant retransmission consent under this subsection with respect to a cable system, the provisions of section 534 of this title shall not apply to the carriage of the signal of such station by such cable system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The exercise by a television broadcast station of the right to grant retransmission consent under this subsection shall not interfere with or supersede the rights under section 534 or 535 of this title of any station electing to assert the right to signal carriage under that section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Nothing in this section shall be construed as modifying the compulsory copyright license established in section 111 of title 17 or as affecting existing or future video programming licensing agreements between broadcasting stations and video programmers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Broadcast to foreign countries for rebroadcast to United States; permit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No person shall be permitted to locate, use, or maintain a radio broadcast studio or other place or apparatus from which or whereby sound waves are converted into electrical energy, or mechanical or physical reproduction of sound waves produced, and caused to be transmitted or delivered to a radio station in a foreign country for the purpose of being broadcast from any <!-- PDFPage:94 -->radio station there having a power output of sufficient intensity and/or being so located geographically that its emissions may be received consistently in the United States, without first obtaining a permit from the Commission upon proper application therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Application for permit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such application shall contain such information as the Commission may by regulation prescribe, and the granting or refusal thereof shall be subject to the requirements of section 309 of this title with respect to applications for station licenses or renewal or modification thereof, and the license or permission so granted shall be revocable for false statements in the application so required or when the Commission, after hearings, shall find its continuation no longer in the public interest.</p>
