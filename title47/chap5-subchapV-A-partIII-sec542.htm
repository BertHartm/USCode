<p class="statutory-body">For any twelve-month period, the franchise fees paid by a cable operator with respect to any cable system shall not exceed 5 percent of such cable operator's gross revenues derived in such period from the operation of the cable system to provide cable services. For purposes of this section, the 12-month period shall be the 12-month period applicable under the franchise for accounting purposes. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a franchising authority and a cable operator from agreeing that franchise fees which lawfully could be collected for any such 12-month period shall be paid on a prepaid or deferred basis; except that the sum of the fees paid during the term of the franchise may not exceed the amount, including the time value of money, which would have lawfully been collected if such fees had been paid per annum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Itemization of subscriber bills</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each cable operator may identify, consistent with the regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section 543 of this title, as a separate line item on each regular bill of each subscriber, each of the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The amount of any other fee, tax, assessment, or charge of any kind imposed by any governmental authority on the transaction between the operator and the subscriber.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Court actions; reflection of costs in rate structures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any court action under subsection (c) of this section, the franchising authority shall demonstrate that the rate structure reflects all costs of the franchise fees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Decreases passed through to subscribers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any cable operator shall pass through to subscribers the amount of any decrease in a franchise fee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Itemization of franchise fee in bill</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) any fee imposed under title 17.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Uncompensated services; taxes, fees and other assessments; limitation on fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit any authority of a franchising authority to impose a tax, fee, or other assessment of <!-- PDFPage:245 -->any kind on any person (other than a cable operator) with respect to cable service or other communications service provided by such person over a cable system for which charges are assessed to subscribers but not received by the cable operator.</p>
