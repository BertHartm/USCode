<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Commission action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission determines to issue additional licenses for advanced television services, the Commission&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:157 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) should limit the initial eligibility for such licenses to persons that, as of the date of such issuance, are licensed to operate a television broadcast station or hold a permit to construct such a station (or both); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall adopt regulations that allow the holders of such licenses to offer such ancillary or supplementary services on designated frequencies as may be consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Contents of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In prescribing the regulations required by subsection (a) of this section, the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) only permit such licensee or permittee to offer ancillary or supplementary services if the use of a designated frequency for such services is consistent with the technology or method designated by the Commission for the provision of advanced television services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) limit the broadcasting of ancillary or supplementary services on designated frequencies so as to avoid derogation of any advanced television services, including high definition television broadcasts, that the Commission may require using such frequencies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) apply to any other ancillary or supplementary service such of the Commission's regulations as are applicable to the offering of analogous services by any other person, except that no ancillary or supplementary service shall have any rights to carriage under section 534 or 535 of this title or be deemed a multichannel video programming distributor for purposes of section 548 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) adopt such technical and other requirements as may be necessary or appropriate to assure the quality of the signal used to provide advanced television services, and may adopt regulations that stipulate the minimum number of hours per day that such signal must be transmitted; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) prescribe such other regulations as may be necessary for the protection of the public interest, convenience, and necessity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Recovery of license</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission grants a license for advanced television services to a person that, as of the date of such issuance, is licensed to operate a television broadcast station or holds a permit to construct such a station (or both), the Commission shall, as a condition of such license, require that either the additional license or the original license held by the licensee be surrendered to the Commission for reallocation or reassignment (or both) pursuant to Commission regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Public interest requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed as relieving a television broadcasting station from its obligation to serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity. In the Commission's review of any application for renewal of a broadcast license for a television station that provides ancillary or supplementary services, the television licensee shall establish that all of its program services on the existing or advanced television spectrum are in the public interest. Any violation of the Commission rules applicable to ancillary or supplementary services shall reflect upon the licensee's qualifications for renewal of its license.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Fees</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the regulations prescribed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section permit a licensee to offer ancillary or supplementary services on a designated frequency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for which the payment of a subscription fee is required in order to receive such services, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for which the licensee directly or indirectly receives compensation from a third party in return for transmitting material furnished by such third party (other than commercial advertisements used to support broadcasting for which a subscription fee is not required),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the Commission shall establish a program to assess and collect from the licensee for such designated frequency an annual fee or other schedule or method of payment that promotes the objectives described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Collection of fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The program required by paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be designed (i) to recover for the public a portion of the value of the public spectrum resource made available for such commercial use, and (ii) to avoid unjust enrichment through the method employed to permit such uses of that resource;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) recover for the public an amount that, to the extent feasible, equals but does not exceed (over the term of the license) the amount that would have been recovered had such services been licensed pursuant to the provisions of section 309(j) of this title and the Commission's regulations thereunder; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) be adjusted by the Commission from time to time in order to continue to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of revenues</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), all proceeds obtained pursuant to the regulations required by this subsection shall be deposited in the Treasury in accordance with chapter 33 of title 31.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Application for and award of licenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Consistent with the requirements set forth in paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection, a licensee may submit an application for class A designation under this paragraph within 30 days after final regulations are adopted under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. Except as provided in paragraphs (6) and (7), the Commission shall, within 30 days after receipt of an application of a licensee of a qualifying low-power television station that is acceptable for filing, award such a class A television station license to such licensee.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Resolution of technical problems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall act to preserve the service areas of low-power television licensees pending the final resolution of a class A application. If, after granting certification of eligibility for a class A license, technical problems arise requiring an engineering solution to a full-power station's allotted parameters or channel assignment in the digital television Table of Allotments, the Commission shall make such modifications as necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to ensure replication of the full-power digital television applicant's service area, as provided for in sections 73.622 and 73.623 of the Commission's regulations (47 CFR 73.622, 73.623); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to permit maximization of a full-power digital television applicant's service area consistent with such sections 73.622 and 73.623,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">if such applicant has filed an application for maximization or a notice of its intent to seek such maximization by December 31, 1999, and filed a bona fide application for maximization by May 1, 2000. Any such applicant shall comply with all applicable Commission rules regarding the construction of digital television facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Change applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a station that is awarded a construction permit to maximize or significantly enhance its digital television service area, later files a change application to reduce its digital television service area, the protected contour of that station shall be reduced in accordance with such change modification.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Qualifying low-power television stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, a station is a qualifying low-power television station if&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings Regarding Low-Power Broadcasters</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;113, div. B, &sect;1000(a)(9) [title V, &sect;5008(b)], Nov. 29, 1999, 113 Stat. 1536, 1501A&ndash;594, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Since the creation of low-power television licenses by the Federal Communications Commission, a small number of license holders have operated their stations in a manner beneficial to the public good providing broadcasting to their communities that would not otherwise be available.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) These low-power broadcasters have operated their stations in a manner consistent with the programming objectives and hours of operation of full-power broadcasters providing worthwhile services to their respective communities while under severe license limitations compared to their full-power counterparts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) License limitations, particularly the temporary nature of the license, have blocked many low-power broadcasters from having access to capital, and have severely hampered their ability to continue to provide quality broadcasting, programming, or improvements.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 [Pub. L. 104&ndash;104, see Short Title of 1996 Amendment note set out under section 609 of this title] has added to the uncertainty of the future status of these stations by the lack of specific provisions regarding the permanency of their licenses, or their treatment during the transition to high definition, digital television.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) It is in the public interest to promote diversity in television programming such as that currently provided by low-power television stations to foreign-language communities.&rdquo;</p>
