<p class="statutory-body-1em">As part of the assessment and report required by section 1302 of this title, the Federal <!-- PDFPage:341 -->Communications Commission shall include information comparing the extent of broadband service capability (including data transmission speeds and price for broadband service capability) in a total of 75 communities in at least 25 countries abroad for each of the data rate benchmarks for broadband service utilized by the Commission to reflect different speed tiers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall choose communities for the comparison under this subsection in a manner that will offer, to the extent possible, communities of a population size, population density, topography, and demographic profile that are comparable to the population size, population density, topography, and demographic profile of various communities within the United States. The Commission shall include in the comparison under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a geographically diverse selection of countries; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the types of technology used to provide the broadband service capability to which consumers subscribe;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amounts consumers pay per month for such capability;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the actual data transmission speeds of such capability;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the types of applications and services consumers most frequently use in conjunction with such capability;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) for consumers who have declined to subscribe to broadband service capability, the reasons given by such consumers for declining such capability;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) other sources of broadband service capability which consumers regularly use or on which they rely; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) any other information the Commission deems appropriate for such purpose.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Public availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall make publicly available the results of surveys conducted under this subsection at least once per year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Improving Census data on broadband</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Federal Communications Commission, shall expand the American Community Survey conducted by the Bureau of the Census to elicit information for residential households, including those located on native lands, to determine whether persons at such households own or use a computer at that address, whether persons at that address subscribe to Internet service and, if so, whether such persons subscribe to dial-up or broadband Internet service at that address.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Proprietary information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter shall reduce or remove any obligation the Commission has to protect proprietary information, nor shall this chapter be construed to compel the Commission to make publicly available any proprietary information.</p>
