If the Commission determines that such opportunity to access does not exist, the Commission shall take appropriate action to facilitate such direct access pursuant to its authority under this chapter and the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.].

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The United States Government shall not require signatories to represent the United States in INTELSAT or Inmarsat or in any successor entities after a pro-competitive privatization is achieved consistent with sections 763, 763a, and 763c&nbsp;<sup><a href="#765a_1_target" name="765a_1">1</a></sup> of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">COMSAT or any successor in interest shall not be liable for action taken by it in carrying out the specific, written instruction of the United States issued in connection with its relationships and activities with foreign governments, international entities, and the intergovernmental satellite organizations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) No joint or several liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If COMSAT is found liable for any action taken in its status as a signatory or a representative of the party to INTELSAT, any such liability shall be limited to the portion of the judgment that corresponds to COMSAT's percentage of the ownership of INTELSAT at the time the activity began which lead to the liability.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Provisions prospective</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to liability for any action taken by COMSAT before March 17, 2000.</p>
