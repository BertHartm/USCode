<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;access code&rdquo; means a sequence of numbers that, when dialed, connect the caller to the provider of operator services associated with that sequence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;aggregator&rdquo; means any person that, in the ordinary course of its operations, makes telephones available to the public or to transient users of its premises, for interstate telephone calls using a provider of operator services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;call splashing&rdquo; means the transfer of a telephone call from one provider of operator services to another such provider in such a manner that the subsequent provider is unable or unwilling to determine the location of the origination of the call and, because of such inability or unwillingness, is prevented from billing the call on the basis of such location.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The term &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; means a person initiating any interstate telephone call using operator services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The term &ldquo;equal access&rdquo; has the meaning given that term in Appendix B of the Modification of Final Judgment entered August 24, 1982, in United States v. Western Electric, Civil Action No. 82&ndash;0192 (United States District Court, District of Columbia), as amended by the Court in its orders issued prior to October 17, 1990.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The term &ldquo;equal access code&rdquo; means an access code that allows the public to obtain an equal access connection to the carrier associated with that code.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The term &ldquo;operator services&rdquo; means any interstate telecommunications service initiated from an aggregator location that includes, as a component, any automatic or live assistance to a consumer to arrange for billing or completion, or both, of an interstate telephone call through a method other than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) automatic completion with billing to the telephone from which the call originated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) completion through an access code used by the consumer, with billing to an account previously established with the carrier by the consumer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The term &ldquo;presubscribed provider of operator services&rdquo; means the interstate provider of operator services to which the consumer is connected when the consumer places a call using a provider of operator services without dialing an access code.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The term &ldquo;provider of operator services&rdquo; means any common carrier that provides operator services or any other person determined by the Commission to be providing operator services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) withhold payment (on a location-by-location basis) of any compensation, including commissions, to aggregators if such provider reasonably believes that the aggregator (i) is blocking access by means of &ldquo;950&rdquo; or &ldquo;800&rdquo; numbers to interstate common carriers in violation of subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section or (ii) is blocking access to equal access codes in violation of rules the Commission may prescribe under subsection (e)(1) of this section;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) not engage in call splashing, unless the consumer requests to be transferred to another provider of operator services, the consumer is informed prior to incurring any charges that the rates for the call may not reflect the rates from the actual originating location of the call, and the consumer then consents to be transferred; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) except as provided in subparagraph (H), not bill for a call that does not reflect the location of the origination of the call.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional requirements for first 3 years</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) ensure that no charge by the aggregator to the consumer for using an &ldquo;800&rdquo; or &ldquo;950&rdquo; access code number, or any other access code number, is greater than the amount the aggregator charges for calls placed using the presubscribed provider of operator services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effect of State law or regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirements of paragraph (1)(A) shall not apply to an aggregator in any case in which State law or State regulation requires the aggregator to take actions that are substantially the same as those required in paragraph (1)(A).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission,<sup><a href="#226_1_target" name="226_1">1</a></sup> shall require&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Waiver authority</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Review of informational tariffs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the rates and charges filed by any provider of operator services under paragraph (1) appear upon review by the Commission to be unjust or unreasonable, the Commission may require such provider of operator services to do either or both of the following:</p>

Such regulations shall include limitations on the amount of commissions or any other compensation given to aggregators by providers of operator service.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The requirement of subparagraph (A) shall not apply if, on the basis of the proceeding under paragraph (3)(A), the Commission makes (and includes in the report required by paragraph (3)(B)(iii)) a factual determination that market forces are securing rates and charges that are just and reasonable, as evidenced by rate levels, costs, complaints, service quality, and other relevant factors.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 2 of Pub. L. 101&ndash;435 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the divestiture of AT&T and decisions allowing open entry for competitors in the telephone marketplace produced a variety of new services and many new providers of existing telephone services;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the growth of competition in the telecommunications market makes it essential to ensure that safeguards are in place to assure fairness for consumers and service providers alike;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) a variety of providers of operator services now compete to win contracts to provide operator services to hotels, hospitals, airports, and other aggregators of telephone business from consumers;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the mere existence of a variety of service providers in the operator services marketplace is significant in making that market competitive only when consumers are able to make informed choices from among those service providers;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) however, often consumers have no choices in selecting a provider of operator services, and often attempts by consumers to reach their preferred long distance carrier by using a telephone billing card, credit card, or prearranged access code number are blocked;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) a number of State regulatory authorities have taken action to protect consumers using intrastate operator services;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) from January 1988 through February 1990, the Federal Communications Commission received over 4,000 complaints from consumers about operator services;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) those consumers have complained that they are denied access to the interexchange carrier of their choice, that they are deceived about the identity of the company providing operator services for their calls and the rates being charged, that they lack information on what they can do to complain about unfair treatment by an operator service provider, and that they are, accordingly, being deprived of the free choice essential to the operation of a competitive market;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the Commission has testified that its actions have been insufficient to correct the problems in the operator services industry to date; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) a combination of industry self-regulation and government regulation is required to ensure that competitive operator services are provided in a fair and reasonable manner.&rdquo;</p>
