He may give these directions at and for such times as he may determine, and may modify, change, suspend, or annul them and for any such purpose he is authorized to issue orders directly, or through such person or persons as he designates for the purpose, or through the Commission.

<!-- PDFPage:272 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Obstruction of interstate or foreign communications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any person during any war in which the United States is engaged to knowingly or willfully, by physical force or intimidation by threats of physical force, obstruct or retard or aid in obstructing or retarding interstate or foreign communication by radio or wire.

Such suit shall be brought in the manner provided by section 1346 or section 1491 of title 28.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Affect on State laws and powers</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Commission shall periodically assess the appropriateness of continuing in effect the exemptions provided by such regulations for telephones used with public mobile services and telephones used with private radio services. The Commission shall revoke or otherwise limit any such exemption if the Commission determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) such revocation or limitation is in the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) continuation of the exemption without such revocation or limitation would have an adverse effect on hearing-impaired individuals;</p>

The Commission shall not grant such a waiver unless the Commission determines, on the basis of evidence in the record of such proceeding, that such telephones, or such technology or service, are in the public interest, and that (A) compliance with the requirements of paragraph (1)(B) is technologically infeasible, or (B) compliance with such requirements would increase the costs of the telephones, or of the technology or service, to such an extent that such telephones, technology, or service could not be successfully marketed. In any proceeding under this paragraph to grant a waiver from the requirements of paragraph (1)(B), the Commission shall consider the effect on hearing-impaired individuals of granting the waiver. The Commission shall periodically review and determine the continuing need for any waiver granted pursuant to this paragraph.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Commission inquiry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 180 days after February 8, 1996, the Federal Communications Commission shall <!-- PDFPage:278 -->complete an inquiry to ascertain the level at which video programming is closed captioned. Such inquiry shall examine the extent to which existing or previously published programming is closed captioned, the size of the video programming provider or programming owner providing closed captioning, the size of the market served, the relative audience shares achieved, or any other related factors. The Commission shall submit to the Congress a report on the results of such inquiry.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Accountability criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 18 months after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall prescribe such regulations as are necessary to implement this section. Such regulations shall ensure that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a provider of video programming or the owner of any program carried by the provider shall not be obligated to supply closed captions if such action would be inconsistent with contracts in effect on February 8, 1996, except that nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a video programming provider of its obligations to provide services required by Federal law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a provider of video programming or program owner may petition the Commission for an exemption from the requirements of this section, and the Commission may grant such petition upon a showing that the requirements contained in this section would result in an undue burden.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Undue burden</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;undue burden&rdquo; means significant difficulty or expense. In determining whether the closed captions necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph would result in an undue economic burden, the factors to be considered include&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the impact on the operation of the provider or program owner;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the financial resources of the provider or program owner; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the type of operations of the provider or program owner.</p>

The Commission's report shall assess appropriate methods and schedules for phasing video descriptions into the marketplace, technical and quality standards for video descriptions, a definition of programming for which video descriptions would apply, and other technical and legal issues that the Commission deems appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Video description</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, &ldquo;video description&rdquo; means the insertion of audio narrated descriptions of a television program's key visual elements into natural pauses between the program's dialogue.</p>
