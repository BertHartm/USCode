<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The deployment and adoption of broadband technology has resulted in enhanced economic development and public safety for communities across the Nation, improved health <!-- PDFPage:340 -->care and educational opportunities, and a better quality of life for all Americans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Continued progress in the deployment and adoption of broadband technology is vital to ensuring that our Nation remains competitive and continues to create business and job growth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Improving Federal data on the deployment and adoption of broadband service will assist in the development of broadband technology across all regions of the Nation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Federal Government should also recognize and encourage complementary State efforts to improve the quality and usefulness of broadband data and should encourage and support the partnership of the public and private sectors in the continued growth of broadband services and information technology for the residents and businesses of the Nation.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission and each State commission with regulatory jurisdiction over telecommunications services shall encourage the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans (including, in particular, elementary and secondary schools and classrooms) by utilizing, in a manner consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, price cap regulation, regulatory forbearance, measures that promote competition in the local telecommunications market, or other regulating methods that remove barriers to infrastructure investment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inquiry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall, within 30 months after February 8, 1996, and annually thereafter, initiate a notice of inquiry concerning the availability of advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans (including, in particular, elementary and secondary schools and classrooms) and shall complete the inquiry within 180 days after its initiation. In the inquiry, the Commission shall determine whether advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion. If the Commission's determination is negative, it shall take immediate action to accelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and by promoting competition in the telecommunications market.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Demographic information for unserved areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As part of the inquiry required by subsection (b), the Commission shall compile a list of geographical areas that are not served by any provider of advanced telecommunications capability (as defined by subsection (d)(1))&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1302_1_target" name="1302_1">1</a></sup> and to the extent that data from the Census Bureau is available, determine, for each such unserved area&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the population;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the population density; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the average per capita income.</p>
