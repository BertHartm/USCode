<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) at any technically feasible point within the carrier's network;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) that is at least equal in quality to that provided by the local exchange carrier to itself or to any subsidiary, affiliate, or any other party to which the carrier provides interconnection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) on rates, terms, and conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement and the requirements of this section and section 252 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Exemption for certain rural telephone companies</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subsection (c) of this section shall not apply to a rural telephone company until (i) such company has received a bona fide request for interconnection, services, or network elements, and (ii) the State commission determines (under subparagraph (B)) that such request is not unduly economically burdensome, is technically feasible, and is consistent with section 254 of this title (other than subsections (b)(7) and (c)(1)(D) thereof).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) State termination of exemption and implementation schedule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The party making a bona fide request of a rural telephone company for interconnection, services, or network elements shall submit a notice of its request to the State commission. The State commission shall conduct an inquiry for the purpose of determining whether to terminate the exemption under subparagraph (A). Within 120 days after the State commission receives notice of the request, the State commission shall terminate the exemption if the request is not unduly economically burdensome, is technically feasible, and is consistent with section 254 of this title (other than subsections (b)(7) and (c)(1)(D) thereof). Upon termination of the exemption, a State commission shall establish an implementation schedule for compliance with the request that is consistent in time and manner with Commission regulations.</p>

The State commission shall grant such petition to the extent that, and for such duration as, the State commission determines that such suspension or modification&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to avoid a significant adverse economic impact on users of telecommunications services generally;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to avoid imposing a requirement that is unduly economically burdensome; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to avoid imposing a requirement that is technically infeasible; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The State commission shall act upon any petition filed under this paragraph within 180 days after receiving such petition. Pending such action, the State commission may suspend enforcement of the requirement or requirements to which the petition applies with respect to the petitioning carrier or carriers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Continued enforcement of exchange access and interconnection requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On and after February 8, 1996, each local exchange carrier, to the extent that it provides wireline services, shall provide exchange access, information access, and exchange services for such access to interexchange carriers and information service providers in accordance with the same equal access and nondiscriminatory interconnection restrictions and obligations (including receipt of compensation) that apply to such carrier on the date immediately preceding February 8, 1996, under any court order, consent decree, or regulation, order, or policy of the Commission, until such restrictions and obligations are explicitly superseded by regulations prescribed by the Commission after February 8, 1996. During the period beginning on February 8, 1996, and until such restrictions and obligations are so superseded, such restrictions and obligations shall be enforceable in the same manner as regulations of the Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such carrier has substantially replaced an incumbent local exchange carrier described in paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such treatment is consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity and the purposes of this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Duty of petitioner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A party that petitions a State commission under paragraph (1) shall, at the same time as it submits the petition, provide the State commission all relevant documentation concerning&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Action by State commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The State commission shall limit its consideration of any petition under paragraph (1) (and any response thereto) to the issues set forth in the petition and in the response, if any, filed under paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The State commission may require the petitioning party and the responding party to provide such information as may be necessary for the State commission to reach a decision on the unresolved issues. If any party refuses or fails unreasonably to respond on a timely basis to any reasonable request from the State commission, then the State commission may proceed on the basis of the best information available to it from whatever source derived.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The State commission shall resolve each issue set forth in the petition and the response, if any, by imposing appropriate conditions as required to implement subsection (c) of this section upon the parties to the agreement, and shall conclude the resolution of any unresolved issues not later than 9 months after the date on which the local exchange carrier received the request under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Refusal to negotiate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The refusal of any other party to the negotiation to participate further in the negotiations, to cooperate with the State commission in carrying out its function as an arbitrator, or to continue to negotiate in good faith in the presence, or with the assistance, of the State commission shall be considered a failure to negotiate in good faith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Standards for arbitration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In resolving by arbitration under subsection (b) of this section any open issues and imposing conditions upon the parties to the agreement, a State commission shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) based on the cost (determined without reference to a rate-of-return or other rate-based proceeding) of providing the interconnection or network element (whichever is applicable), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) nondiscriminatory, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may include a reasonable profit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Charges for transport and termination of traffic</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purposes of compliance by an incumbent local exchange carrier with section 251(b)(5) of this title, a State commission shall not consider the terms and conditions for reciprocal compensation to be just and reasonable unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such terms and conditions provide for the mutual and reciprocal recovery by each carrier of costs associated with the transport and termination on each carrier's network facilities of calls that originate on the network facilities of the other carrier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such terms and conditions determine such costs on the basis of a reasonable approximation of the additional costs of terminating such calls.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Rules of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This paragraph shall not be construed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to preclude arrangements that afford the mutual recovery of costs through the offsetting of reciprocal obligations, including arrangements that waive mutual recovery (such as bill-and-keep arrangements); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to authorize the Commission or any State commission to engage in any rate regulation proceeding to establish with particularity the additional costs of transporting or terminating calls, or to require carriers to maintain records with respect to the additional costs of such calls.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the implementation of such agreement or portion is not consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Preservation of authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (2), but subject to section 253 of this title, nothing in this section shall prohibit a State commission from establishing or enforcing other requirements of State law in its review of an agreement, including requiring compliance with intrastate telecommunications service quality standards or requirements.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Commission to act if State will not act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State commission fails to act to carry out its responsibility under this section in any proceeding or other matter under this section, then the Commission shall issue an order preempting the State commission's jurisdiction of that proceeding or matter within 90 days after being notified (or taking notice) of such failure, and shall assume the responsibility of the State commission under this section with respect to the proceeding or matter and act for the State commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Review of State commission actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In a case in which a State fails to act as described in paragraph (5), the proceeding by the Commission under such paragraph and any judicial review of the Commission's actions shall be the exclusive remedies for a State commission's failure to act. In any case in which a State commission makes a determination under this section, any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate Federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section 251 of this title and this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Procedures to review universal service requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Federal-State Joint Board on universal service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within one month after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall institute and refer to a Federal-State Joint Board under section 410(c) of this title a proceeding to recommend changes to any of its regulations in order to implement sections 214(e) of this title and this section, including the definition of the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms and a specific timetable for completion of such recommendations. In addition to the members of the Joint Board required under section 410(c) of this title, one member of such Joint Board shall be a State-appointed utility consumer advocate nominated by a national organization of State utility consumer advocates. The Joint Board shall, after notice and opportunity for public comment, make its recommendations to the Commission 9 months after February 8, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Commission action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall initiate a single proceeding to implement the recommendations from the Joint Board required by paragraph (1) and shall complete such proceeding within 15 months after February 8, 1996. The rules established by such proceeding shall include a definition of the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms and a specific timetable for implementation. Thereafter, the Commission shall complete <!-- PDFPage:90 -->any proceeding to implement subsequent recommendations from any Joint Board on universal service within one year after receiving such recommendations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Universal service principles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Joint Board and the Commission shall base policies for the preservation and advancement of universal service on the following principles:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Quality and rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Quality services should be available at just, reasonable, and affordable rates.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Access to advanced services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Access to advanced telecommunications and information services should be provided in all regions of the Nation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Access in rural and high cost areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Consumers in all regions of the Nation, including low-income consumers and those in rural, insular, and high cost areas, should have access to telecommunications and information services, including interexchange services and advanced telecommunications and information services, that are reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban areas and that are available at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Equitable and nondiscriminatory contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All providers of telecommunications services should make an equitable and nondiscriminatory contribution to the preservation and advancement of universal service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Specific and predictable support mechanisms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There should be specific, predictable and sufficient Federal and State mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Access to advanced telecommunications services for schools, health care, and libraries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Elementary and secondary schools and classrooms, health care providers, and libraries should have access to advanced telecommunications services as described in subsection (h) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Additional principles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such other principles as the Joint Board and the Commission determine are necessary and appropriate for the protection of the public interest, convenience, and necessity and are consistent with this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definition</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Universal service is an evolving level of telecommunications services that the Commission shall establish periodically under this section, taking into account advances in telecommunications and information technologies and services. The Joint Board in recommending, and the Commission in establishing, the definition of the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms shall consider the extent to which such telecommunications services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are essential to education, public health, or public safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) have, through the operation of market choices by customers, been subscribed to by a substantial majority of residential customers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) are being deployed in public telecommunications networks by telecommunications carriers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) are consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Alterations and modifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Joint Board may, from time to time, recommend to the Commission modifications in the definition of the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to the services included in the definition of universal service under paragraph (1), the Commission may designate additional services for such support mechanisms for schools, libraries, and health care providers for the purposes of subsection (h) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Telecommunications carrier contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, to the specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms established by the Commission to preserve and advance universal service. The Commission may exempt a carrier or class of carriers from this requirement if the carrier's telecommunications activities are limited to such an extent that the level of such carrier's contribution to the preservation and advancement of universal service would be de minimis. Any other provider of interstate telecommunications may be required to contribute to the preservation and advancement of universal service if the public interest so requires.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Universal service support</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After the date on which Commission regulations implementing this section take effect, only an eligible telecommunications carrier designated under section 214(e) of this title shall be eligible to receive specific Federal universal service support. A carrier that receives such support shall use that support only for the provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities and services for which the support is intended. Any such support should be explicit and sufficient to achieve the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) State authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State may adopt regulations not inconsistent with the Commission's rules to preserve and advance universal service. Every telecommunications carrier that provides intrastate telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, in a manner determined by the State to the preservation and advancement of universal service in that State. A State may adopt regulations to provide for additional definitions and standards to preserve and advance universal service within that State only to the extent that such regulations adopt additional specific, predictable, and <!-- PDFPage:91 -->sufficient mechanisms to support such definitions or standards that do not rely on or burden Federal universal service support mechanisms.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Interexchange and interstate services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 6 months after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall adopt rules to require that the rates charged by providers of interexchange telecommunications services to subscribers in rural and high cost areas shall be no higher than the rates charged by each such provider to its subscribers in urban areas. Such rules shall also require that a provider of interstate interexchange telecommunications services shall provide such services to its subscribers in each State at rates no higher than the rates charged to its subscribers in any other State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Telecommunications services for certain providers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Health care providers for rural areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A telecommunications carrier shall, upon receiving a bona fide request, provide telecommunications services which are necessary for the provision of health care services in a State, including instruction relating to such services, to any public or nonprofit health care provider that serves persons who reside in rural areas in that State at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas in that State. A telecommunications carrier providing service under this paragraph shall be entitled to have an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the rates for services provided to health care providers for rural areas in a State and the rates for similar services provided to other customers in comparable rural areas in that State treated as a service obligation as a part of its obligation to participate in the mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Educational providers and libraries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">All telecommunications carriers serving a geographic area shall, upon a bona fide request for any of its services that are within the definition of universal service under subsection (c)(3) of this section, provide such services to elementary schools, secondary schools, and libraries for educational purposes at rates less than the amounts charged for similar services to other parties. The discount shall be an amount that the Commission, with respect to interstate services, and the States, with respect to intrastate services, determine is appropriate and necessary to ensure affordable access to and use of such services by such entities. A telecommunications carrier providing service under this paragraph shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) have an amount equal to the amount of the discount treated as an offset to its obligation to contribute to the mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, receive reimbursement utilizing the support mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Advanced services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall establish competitively neutral rules&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to enhance, to the extent technically feasible and economically reasonable, access to advanced telecommunications and information services for all public and nonprofit elementary and secondary school classrooms, health care providers, and libraries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to define the circumstances under which a telecommunications carrier may be required to connect its network to such public institutional telecommunications users.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Telecommunications services and network capacity provided to a public institutional telecommunications user under this subsection may not be sold, resold, or otherwise transferred by such user in consideration for money or any other thing of value.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Eligibility of users</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No entity listed in this subsection shall be entitled to preferential rates or treatment as required by this subsection, if such entity operates as a for-profit business, is a school described in paragraph (7)(A) with an endowment of more than $50,000,000, or is a library or library consortium not eligible for assistance from a State library administrative agency under the Library Services and Technology Act [20 U.S.C. 9121 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Requirements for certain schools with computers having Internet access</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Internet safety</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided in clause (ii), an elementary or secondary school having computers with Internet access may not receive services at discount rates under paragraph (1)(B) unless the school, school board, local educational agency, or other authority with responsibility for administration of the school&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) submits to the Commission the certifications described in subparagraphs (B) and (C);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) submits to the Commission a certification that an Internet safety policy has been adopted and implemented for the school under subsection (<em>l</em>) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) ensures the use of such computers in accordance with the certifications.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The prohibition in clause (i) shall not apply with respect to a school that receives services at discount rates under paragraph (1)(B) only for purposes other than the provision of Internet access, Internet service, or internal connections.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Public notice; hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">An elementary or secondary school described in clause (i), or the school board, <!-- PDFPage:92 -->local educational agency, or other authority with responsibility for administration of the school, shall provide reasonable public notice and hold at least one public hearing or meeting to address the proposed Internet safety policy. In the case of an elementary or secondary school other than an elementary or secondary school as defined in section 8801&nbsp;<sup><a href="#254_1_target" name="254_1">1</a></sup> of title 20, the notice and hearing required by this clause may be limited to those members of the public with a relationship to the school.</p>
