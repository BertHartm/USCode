<p class="statutory-body">(a) In addition to any other provisions required to be included in a radio station license, the station license of each ship of the United States subject to this subchapter shall include particulars with reference to the items specifically required by this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Every ship of the United States, subject to this part, shall have the equipment and apparatus prescribed therein, inspected at least once each year by the Commission. If, after such inspection, the Commission is satisfied that all relevant provisions of this chapter and the station license have been complied with, that fact shall be certified to on the station license by the Commission. The Commission shall make such additional inspections at frequent intervals as may be necessary to insure compliance with the requirements of this chapter. The Commission may, upon a finding that the public interest would be served thereby, waive the annual inspection required under this section from the time of first arrival at a United States port from a foreign port, for the sole purpose of enabling the vessel to proceed coastwise to another port in the United States where an inspection can be held: <em>Provided</em>, That such waiver may not exceed a period of thirty days.</p>
