<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within one year after any decision to create any separated entity, a public offering of the securities of such entity shall be conducted. In the case of a separated entity created before January 1, 1999, such public offering shall be conducted no later than July 1, 2000, except that the Commission may extend this deadline in consideration of market conditions and relevant business factors relating to the timing of an initial public offering, but such extensions shall not permit such offering to be conducted later than July 31, 2001.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Spectrum assignments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the initial transfer which may accompany the creation of a separated entity, the portions of the electromagnetic spectrum assigned as of March 17, 2000, to INTELSAT shall not be transferred between INTELSAT and any separated entity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Reaffiliation prohibited</h4>
