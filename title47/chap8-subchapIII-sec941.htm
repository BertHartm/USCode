<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Responsibilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The NTIA shall require the registry selected to operate and maintain the United States country code Internet domain to establish, operate, and maintain a second-level domain within the United States country code domain that provides access only to material that is suitable for minors and not harmful to minors (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;new domain&rdquo;).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions of contracts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Initial registry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The NTIA shall not exercise any option periods under any contract between the NTIA and the initial registry to operate and maintain the United States country code Internet domain unless the initial registry agrees, during the 90-day period beginning upon December 4, 2002, to carry out, and to operate the new domain in accordance with, the requirements under subsection (c) of this section. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the initial registry of the United States country code Internet domain from participating in the NTIA's process for selecting a successor registry or to prevent the NTIA from awarding, to the initial registry, the contract to be successor registry subject to the requirements of paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Successor registries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The NTIA shall not enter into any contract for operating and maintaining the United States country code Internet domain with any successor registry unless such registry enters into an agreement with the NTIA, during the 90-day period after selection of such registry, that provides for the registry to carry out, and the new domain to operate in accordance with, the requirements under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requirements of new domain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The registry and new domain shall be subject to the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Written content standards for the new domain, except that the NTIA shall not have any authority to establish such standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Written agreements with each registrar for the new domain that require that use of the new domain is in accordance with the standards and requirements of the registry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Written agreements with registrars, which shall require registrars to enter into written agreements with registrants, to use the new domain in accordance with the standards and requirements of the registry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Rules and procedures for enforcement and oversight that minimize the possibility that the new domain provides access to content that is not in accordance with the standards and requirements of the registry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) A process for removing from the new domain any content that is not in accordance with the standards and requirements of the registry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A process to provide registrants to the new domain with an opportunity for a prompt, expeditious, and impartial dispute resolution process regarding any material of the registrant excluded from the new domain.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Continuous and uninterrupted service for the new domain during any transition to a new registry selected to operate and maintain new domain or the United States country code domain.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Procedures and mechanisms to promote the accuracy of contact information submitted by registrants and retained by registrars in the new domain.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Operationality of the new domain not later than one year after December 4, 2002.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Written agreements with registrars, which shall require registrars to enter into written agreements with registrants, to prohibit two-way and multiuser interactive services in the new domain, unless the registrant certifies to the registrar that such service will be offered in compliance with the content standards established pursuant to paragraph (1) and is designed to reduce the risk of exploitation of minors using such two-way and multiuser interactive services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Written agreements with registrars, which shall require registrars to enter into written agreements with registrants, to prohibit hyperlinks in the new domain that take new domain users outside of the new domain.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Any other action that the NTIA considers necessary to establish, operate, or maintain the new domain in accordance with the purposes of this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:316 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Option periods for initial registry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The NTIA shall grant the initial registry the option periods available under the contract between the NTIA and the initial registry to operate and maintain the United States country code Internet domain if, and may not grant such option periods unless, the NTIA finds that the initial registry has satisfactorily performed its obligations under this Act and under the contract. Nothing in this section shall preempt or alter the NTIA's authority to terminate such contract for the operation of the United States country code Internet domain for cause or for convenience.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings and Purposes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;317, &sect;2, Dec. 4, 2002, 116 Stat. 2766, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the World Wide Web presents a stimulating and entertaining opportunity for children to learn, grow, and develop educationally and intellectually;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Internet technology also makes available an extensive amount of information that is harmful to children, as studies indicate that a significant portion of all material available on the Internet is related to pornography;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) young children, when trying to use the World Wide Web for positive purposes, are often presented&mdash;either mistakenly or intentionally&mdash;with material that is inappropriate for their age, which can be extremely frustrating for children, parents, and educators;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) exposure of children to material that is inappropriate for them, including pornography, can distort the education and development of the Nation's youth and represents a serious harm to American families that can lead to a host of other problems for children, including inappropriate use of chat rooms, physical molestation, harassment, and legal and financial difficulties;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) young boys and girls, older teens, troubled youth, frequent Internet users, chat room participants, online risk takers, and those who communicate online with strangers are at greater risk for receiving unwanted sexual solicitation on the Internet;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) studies have shown that 19 percent of youth (ages 10 to 17) who used the Internet regularly were the targets of unwanted sexual solicitation, but less than 10 percent of the solicitations were reported to the police;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) children who come across illegal content should report it to the congressionally authorized CyberTipline, an online mechanism developed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, for citizens to report sexual crimes against children;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) the CyberTipline has received more than 64,400 reports, including reports of child pornography, online enticement for sexual acts, child molestation (outside the family), and child prostitution;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) although the computer software and hardware industries, and other related industries, have developed innovative ways to help parents and educators restrict material that is harmful to minors through parental control protections and self-regulation, to date such efforts have not provided a national solution to the problem of minors accessing harmful material on the World Wide Web;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) the creation of a &lsquo;green-light&rsquo; area within the United States country code Internet domain, that will contain only content that is appropriate for children under the age of 13, is analogous to the creation of a children's section within a library and will promote the positive experiences of children and families in the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) while custody, care, and nurture of the child reside first with the parent, the protection of the physical and psychological well-being of minors by shielding them from material that is harmful to them is a compelling governmental interest.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 2002 Amendment note set out under section 901 of this title] are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to facilitate the creation of a second-level domain within the United States country code Internet domain for the location of material that is suitable for minors and not harmful to minors; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to ensure that the National Telecommunications and Information Administration oversees the creation of such a second-level domain and ensures the effective and efficient establishment and operation of the new domain.&rdquo;</p>
