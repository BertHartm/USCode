<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby established in the United States Treasury a fund to be known as the Department of Justice Telecommunications Carrier Compliance Fund (hereafter referred to as &ldquo;the Fund&rdquo;), which shall be available without fiscal year limitation to the Attorney General for making payments to telecommunications carriers, equipment manufacturers, and providers of telecommunications support services pursuant to section 1008 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deposits to Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any agency of the United States with law enforcement or intelligence responsibilities may deposit as offsetting collections to the Fund any unobligated balances that are available until expended, upon compliance with any Congressional notification requirements for reprogrammings of funds applicable to the appropriation from which the deposit is to be made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Attorney General may terminate the Fund at such time as the Attorney General determines that the Fund is no longer necessary.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Availability of funds for expenditure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Funds shall not be available for obligation unless an implementation plan as set forth in subsection (e) of this section is submitted to each member of the Committees on the Judiciary and Appropriations of both the House of Representatives and the Senate and the Congress does not by law block or prevent the obligation of such funds. Such funds shall be treated as a reprogramming of funds under section 605 of the Department of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997, and shall not be available for obligation or expenditure except in compliance with the procedures set forth in that section and this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a prioritized list of carrier equipment, facilities, and services deployed on or before January 1, 1995, to be modified by carriers at the request of law enforcement based on its investigative needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a projected reimbursement plan that estimates the cost for the coming fiscal year and for each fiscal year thereafter, based on the prioritization of law enforcement needs as outlined in (3),<sup><a href="#1021_1_target" name="1021_1">1</a></sup> of modification by carriers of equipment, facilities and services, installed on or before January 1, 1995.</p>
