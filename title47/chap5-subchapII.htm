<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Whenever there is filed with the Commission any new or revised charge, classification, regulation, or practice, the Commission may either upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, upon reasonable notice, enter upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness thereof; and pending such hearing and the decision thereon the Commission, upon delivering to the carrier or carriers affected thereby a statement in writing of its reasons for such suspension, may suspend the operation of such charge, classification, regulation, or practice, in whole or in part but not for a longer period than five months beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect; and after full hearing the Commission may make such order with reference thereto as would be proper in a proceeding initiated after such charge, classification, regulation, or practice had become effective. If the proceeding has not been concluded and an order made within the period of the suspension, the proposed new or revised charge, classification, regulation, or practice shall go into effect at the end of such period; but in case of a proposed charge for a new service or a revised charge, the Commission may by order require the interested carrier or carriers to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of such charge for a new service or revised charge, specifying by whom and in whose behalf such amounts are paid, and upon completion of the hearing and decision may by further order require the interested carrier or carriers to refund, with interest, to the persons in whose behalf such amounts were paid, such portion of such charge for a new service or revised charges as by its decision shall be found not justified. At any hearing involving a new or revised charge, or a proposed new or revised charge, the burden of proof to show that the new or revised charge, or proposed charge, is just and reasonable shall be upon the carrier, and the Commission shall give to the hearing and decision of such questions preference over all other questions pending before it and decide the same as speedily as possible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Commission shall, with respect to any hearing under this section, issue an order concluding such hearing within 5 months after the date that the charge, classification, regulation, or practice subject to the hearing becomes effective.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:50 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission shall, with respect to any such hearing initiated prior to November 3, 1988, issue an order concluding the hearing not later than 12 months after November 3, 1988.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any order concluding a hearing under this section shall be a final order and may be appealed under section 402(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A local exchange carrier may file with the Commission a new or revised charge, classification, regulation, or practice on a streamlined basis. Any such charge, classification, regulation, or practice shall be deemed lawful and shall be effective 7 days (in the case of a reduction in rates) or 15 days (in the case of an increase in rates) after the date on which it is filed with the Commission unless the Commission takes action under paragraph (1) before the end of that 7-day or 15-day period, as is appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Commission may allow part of a charge, classification, regulation, or practice to go into effect, based upon a written showing by the carrier or carriers affected, and an opportunity for written comment thereon by affected persons, that such partial authorization is just, fair, and reasonable. Additionally, or in combination with a partial authorization, the Commission, upon a similar showing, may allow all or part of a charge, classification, regulation, or practice to go into effect on a temporary basis pending further order of the Commission. Authorizations of temporary new or increased charges may include an accounting order of the type provided for in subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall have power to issue such certificate as applied for, or to refuse to issue it, or to issue it for a portion or portions of a line, or extension thereof, or discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of service, described in the application, or for the partial exercise only of such right or privilege, and may attach to the issuance of the certificate such terms and conditions as in its judgment the public convenience and necessity may require. After issuance of such certificate, and not before, the carrier may, without securing approval other than such certificate, comply with the terms and conditions contained in or attached to the issuance of such certificate and proceed with the construction, extension, acquisition, operation, or discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of service covered thereby. Any construction, extension, acquisition, operation, discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of service contrary to the provisions of this section may be enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction at the suit of the United States, the Commission, the State commission, any State affected, or any party in interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Order of Commission; hearing; penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may, after full opportunity for hearing, in a proceeding upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, authorize or require by order any carrier, party to such proceeding, to provide itself with adequate facilities for the expeditious and efficient performance of its service as a common carrier and to extend its line or to establish a public office; but no such authorization or order shall be made unless the Commission finds, as to such provision of facilities, as to such establishment of public offices, or as to such extension, that it is reasonably required in the interest of public convenience and necessity, or as to such extension or facilities that the expense involved therein will not impair the ability of the carrier to perform its duty to the public. Any carrier which refuses or neglects to comply with any order of the Commission made in pursuance of this subsection shall forfeit to the United States $1,200 for each day during which such refusal or neglect continues.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Provision of universal service</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Eligible telecommunications carriers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A common carrier designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier under paragraph (2), (3), or (6) shall be eligible to receive universal service support in accordance with section 254 of this title and shall, throughout the service area for which the designation is received&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) offer the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms under section 254(c) of this title, either using its own facilities or a combination of its own facilities and resale of another carrier's services (including the services offered by another eligible telecommunications carrier); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) advertise the availability of such services and the charges therefor using media of general distribution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Designation of eligible telecommunications carriers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State commission shall upon its own motion or upon request designate a common carrier that meets the requirements of paragraph (1) as an eligible telecommunications carrier for a service area designated by the State commission. Upon request and consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, the State commission may, in the case of an area served by a rural telephone company, and shall, in the case of all other areas, designate more than one common carrier as an eligible telecommunications carrier for a service area designated by the State commission, so long as each additional requesting carrier meets the requirements of paragraph (1). Before designating an additional eligible telecommunications carrier for an area served by a rural telephone company, the State commission shall find that the designation is in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Designation of eligible telecommunications carriers for unserved areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If no common carrier will provide the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms under section 254(c) of this title to an unserved community or any portion thereof that requests such service, the Commission, with respect to interstate services or an area served by a common carrier to which paragraph (6) applies, or a State commission, with respect to intrastate services, shall determine which common carrier or carriers are best able to provide such service to the requesting unserved community or portion thereof and shall order such carrier or carriers to provide such service for that unserved community or portion thereof. Any carrier or carriers ordered to provide such service under this paragraph shall meet the requirements of paragraph (1) and shall be designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier for that community or portion thereof.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Relinquishment of universal service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State commission (or the Commission in the case of a common carrier designated under paragraph (6)) shall permit an eligible telecommunications carrier to relinquish its designation as such a carrier in any area served by more than one eligible telecommunications carrier. An eligible telecommunications carrier that seeks to relinquish its eligible telecommunications carrier designation for an area served by more than one eligible telecommunications carrier shall give advance notice to the State commission (or the Commission in the case of a common carrier designated under paragraph (6)) of such relinquishment. Prior to permitting a tele<!-- PDFPage:55 -->communications carrier designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier to cease providing universal service in an area served by more than one eligible telecommunications carrier, the State commission (or the Commission in the case of a common carrier designated under paragraph (6)) shall require the remaining eligible telecommunications carrier or carriers to ensure that all customers served by the relinquishing carrier will continue to be served, and shall require sufficient notice to permit the purchase or construction of adequate facilities by any remaining eligible telecommunications carrier. The State commission (or the Commission in the case of a common carrier designated under paragraph (6)) shall establish a time, not to exceed one year after the State commission (or the Commission in the case of a common carrier designated under paragraph (6)) approves such relinquishment under this paragraph, within which such purchase or construction shall be completed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) &ldquo;Service area&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;service area&rdquo; means a geographic area established by a State commission (or the Commission under paragraph (6)) for the purpose of determining universal service obligations and support mechanisms. In the case of an area served by a rural telephone company, &ldquo;service area&rdquo; means such company's &ldquo;study area&rdquo; unless and until the Commission and the States, after taking into account recommendations of a Federal-State Joint Board instituted under section 410(c) of this title, establish a different definition of service area for such company.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Common carriers not subject to State commission jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a common carrier providing telephone exchange service and exchange access that is not subject to the jurisdiction of a State commission, the Commission shall upon request designate such a common carrier that meets the requirements of paragraph (1) as an eligible telecommunications carrier for a service area designated by the Commission consistent with applicable Federal and State law. Upon request and consistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity, the Commission may, with respect to an area served by a rural telephone company, and shall, in the case of all other areas, designate more than one common carrier as an eligible telecommunications carrier for a service area designated under this paragraph, so long as each additional requesting carrier meets the requirements of paragraph (1). Before designating an additional eligible telecommunications carrier for an area served by a rural telephone company, the Commission shall find that the designation is in the public interest.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Forms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission may, in its discretion, prescribe the forms of any and all accounts, records, and memoranda to be kept by carriers subject to this chapter, including the accounts, records, and memoranda of the movement of traffic, as well as of the receipts and expenditures of moneys.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall, by rule, prescribe a uniform system of accounts for use by telephone companies. Such uniform system shall require that each common carrier shall maintain a system of accounting methods, procedures, and techniques (including accounts and supporting records and memoranda) which shall ensure a proper allocation of all costs to and among telecommunications services, facilities, and products (and to and among classes of such services, facilities, and products) which are developed, manufactured, or offered by such common carrier.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Depreciation charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may prescribe, for such carriers as it determines to be appropriate, the classes of property for which depreciation charges may be properly included under operating expenses, and the percentages of depreciation which shall be charged with respect to each of such classes of property, classifying the carriers as it may deem proper for this purpose. The Commission may, when it deems necessary, modify the classes and percentages so prescribed. Such carriers shall not, after the Commission has prescribed the classes of property for which depreciation charges may be included, charge to operating expenses any depreciation charges on classes of property other than those prescribed by the Commission, or after the Commission has prescribed percentages of depreciation, charge with respect to any class of property a percentage of depreciation other than that prescribed therefor by the Commission. No such carrier shall in any case include in any form under its operating or other expenses any depreciation or other charge or expenditure included elsewhere as a depreciation charge or otherwise under its operating or other expenses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Access to information; burden of proof; use of independent auditors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall at all times have access to and the right of inspection and examination of all accounts, records, and memoranda, including all documents, papers, and correspondence now or hereafter existing, and kept or required to be kept by such carriers, and the provisions of this section respecting the preservation and destruction of books, papers, and documents shall apply thereto. The burden of proof to justify every accounting entry questioned by the Commission shall be on the person making, authorizing, or requiring such entry and the Commission may suspend a charge or credit pending submission of proof by such person. Any provision of law prohibiting the disclosure of the contents of messages or communications shall not be deemed to prohibit the disclosure of any matter in accordance with the provisions of this section. The Commission may obtain the services of any person licensed to provide public accounting services under the law of any State to assist with, or conduct, audits under this section. While so employed or engaged in conducting an audit for the Commission under this section, any such person shall have the powers granted the Commission under this subsection and shall be subject to subsection (f) of this section in the same manner as if that person were an employee of the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Penalty for failure to comply</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of subsection (b) of this section, a rate is just and reasonable if it assures a utility the recovery of not less than the additional costs of providing pole attachments, nor more than an amount determined by multiplying the percentage of the total usable space, or the percentage of the total duct or conduit capacity, which is occupied by the pole attachment by the sum of the operating expenses and actual capital costs of the utility attributable to the entire pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;usable space&rdquo; means the space above the minimum grade level which can be used for the attachment of wires, cables, and associated equipment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection shall apply to the rate for any pole attachment used by a cable television system solely to provide cable service. Until the effective date of the regulations required under subsection (e) of this section, this subsection shall also apply to the rate for any pole attachment used by a cable system or any telecommunications carrier (to the extent such carrier is not a party to a pole attachment agreement) to provide any telecommunications service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Regulations governing charges; apportionment of costs of providing space</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall, no later than 2 years after February 8, 1996, prescribe regulations in accordance with this subsection to govern the charges for pole attachments used by telecommunications carriers to provide telecommunications services, when the parties fail to resolve a dispute over such charges. Such regulations shall ensure that a utility charges just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory rates for pole attachments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A utility shall apportion the cost of providing space on a pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way other than the usable space among entities so that such apportionment equals two-thirds of the costs of providing space other than the usable space that would be allocated to such entity under an equal apportionment of such costs among all attaching entities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A utility shall apportion the cost of providing usable space among all entities according to the percentage of usable space required for each entity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The regulations required under paragraph (1) shall become effective 5 years after February 8, 1996. Any increase in the rates for pole attachments that result from the adoption of the regulations required by this subsection shall be phased in equal annual increments over a period of 5 years beginning on the effective date of such regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Nondiscriminatory access</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A utility shall provide a cable television system or any telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to any pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way owned or controlled by it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a utility providing electric service may deny a cable television system or any telecommunications carrier access to its poles, ducts, conduits, or rights-of-way, on a non-discriminatory&nbsp;<sup><a href="#224_1_target" name="224_1">1</a></sup> basis where there is insufficient capacity and for reasons of safety, reliability and generally applicable engineering purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Imputation to costs of pole attachment rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A utility that engages in the provision of telecommunications services or cable services shall impute to its costs of providing such services (and charge any affiliate, subsidiary, or associate company engaged in the provision of such services) an equal amount to the pole attachment rate for which such company would be liable under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Modification or alteration of pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the owner of a pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way intends to modify or alter such pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way, the owner shall provide written notification of such action to any entity that has obtained an attachment to such conduit or right-of-way so that such entity may have a reasonable opportunity to add to or modify its existing attachment. Any entity that adds to or modifies its existing attachment after receiving such notification shall bear a proportionate share of the costs incurred by the owner in making such pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way accessible.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Costs of rearranging or replacing attachment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An entity that obtains an attachment to a pole, conduit, or right-of-way shall not be required to bear any of the costs of rearranging or replacing its attachment, if such rearrangement or replacement is required as a result of an additional attachment or the modification of an existing attachment sought by any other entity (including the owner of such pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Common carrier or carrier</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;common carrier&rdquo; or &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; includes any common carrier engaged in interstate communication by wire or radio as defined in section 153 of this title and any common carrier engaged in intrastate communication by wire or radio, notwithstanding sections 152(b) and 221(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) TDD</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;TDD&rdquo; means a Telecommunications Device for the Deaf, which is a machine that employs graphic communication in the transmission of coded signals through a wire or radio communication system.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Telecommunications relay services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;telecommunications relay services&rdquo; means telephone transmission services that provide the ability for an individual who has a hearing impairment or speech impairment to engage in communication by wire or radio with a hearing individual in a manner that is functionally equivalent to the ability of an individual who does not have a hearing impairment or speech impairment to communicate using voice communication services by wire or radio. Such term includes services that enable two-way communication between an individual who uses a TDD or other nonvoice terminal device and an individual who does not use such a device.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Availability of telecommunications relay services</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to carry out the purposes established under section 151 of this title, to make available to all individuals in the United States a rapid, efficient nationwide communication service, and to increase the utility of the telephone system of the Nation, the Commission shall ensure that interstate and intrastate telecommunications relay services are available, to the extent possible and in the most efficient manner, to hearing-impaired and speech-impaired individuals in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of general authority and remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of administering and enforcing the provisions of this section and the regulations prescribed thereunder, the Commission shall have the same authority, power, and functions with respect to common carriers engaged in intrastate communication as the Commission has in administering and enforcing the provisions of this subchapter with respect to any common carrier engaged in interstate communication. Any violation of this section by any common carrier engaged in intrastate communication shall be subject to the same remedies, penalties, and procedures as are applicable to a violation of this chapter by a common carrier engaged in interstate communication.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Provision of services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each common carrier providing telephone voice transmission services shall, not later than 3 years after July 26, 1990, provide in compliance with the regulations prescribed under this section, throughout the area in which it offers service, telecommunications relay services, individually, through designees, through a competitively selected vendor, or in concert with other carriers. A common carrier shall be considered to be in compliance with such regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) with respect to intrastate telecommunications relay services in any State that does not have a certified program under subsection (f) of this section and with respect to interstate telecommunications relay services, if such common carrier (or other entity through which the carrier is providing such relay services) is in compliance with the Commission's regulations under subsection (d) of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) with respect to intrastate telecommunications relay services in any State that has a certified program under subsection (f) of this <!-- PDFPage:67 -->section for such State, if such common carrier (or other entity through which the carrier is providing such relay services) is in compliance with the program certified under subsection (f) of this section for such State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall, not later than 1 year after July 26, 1990, prescribe regulations to implement this section, including regulations that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) establish functional requirements, guidelines, and operations procedures for telecommunications relay services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establish minimum standards that shall be met in carrying out subsection (c) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) require that telecommunications relay services operate every day for 24 hours per day;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) require that users of telecommunications relay services pay rates no greater than the rates paid for functionally equivalent voice communication services with respect to such factors as the duration of the call, the time of day, and the distance from point of origination to point of termination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) prohibit relay operators from failing to fulfill the obligations of common carriers by refusing calls or limiting the length of calls that use telecommunications relay services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) prohibit relay operators from disclosing the content of any relayed conversation and from keeping records of the content of any such conversation beyond the duration of the call; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) prohibit relay operators from intentionally altering a relayed conversation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Technology</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall ensure that regulations prescribed to implement this section encourage, consistent with section 157(a) of this title, the use of existing technology and do not discourage or impair the development of improved technology.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Jurisdictional separation of costs</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Consistent with the provisions of section 410 of this title, the Commission shall prescribe regulations governing the jurisdictional separation of costs for the services provided pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Recovering costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such regulations shall generally provide that costs caused by interstate telecommunications relay services shall be recovered from all subscribers for every interstate service and costs caused by intrastate telecommunications relay services shall be recovered from the intrastate jurisdiction. In a State that has a certified program under subsection (f) of this section, a State commission shall permit a common carrier to recover the costs incurred in providing intrastate telecommunications relay services by a method consistent with the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to subsections (f) and (g) of this section, the Commission shall enforce this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Complaint</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall resolve, by final order, a complaint alleging a violation of this section within 180 days after the date such complaint is filed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Certification</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) State documentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any State desiring to establish a State program under this section shall submit documentation to the Commission that describes the program of such State for implementing intrastate telecommunications relay services and the procedures and remedies available for enforcing any requirements imposed by the State program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Requirements for certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After review of such documentation, the Commission shall certify the State program if the Commission determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the program makes available to hearing-impaired and speech-impaired individuals, either directly, through designees, through a competitively selected vendor, or through regulation of intrastate common carriers, intrastate telecommunications relay services in such State in a manner that meets or exceeds the requirements of regulations prescribed by the Commission under subsection (d) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the program makes available adequate procedures and remedies for enforcing the requirements of the State program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Method of funding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the Commission shall not refuse to certify a State program based solely on the method such State will implement for funding intrastate telecommunication relay services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Suspension or revocation of certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission may suspend or revoke such certification if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission determines that such certification is no longer warranted. In a State whose program has been suspended or revoked, the Commission shall take such steps as may be necessary, consistent with this section, to ensure continuity of telecommunications relay services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Complaint</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Referral of complaint</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a complaint to the Commission alleges a violation of this section with respect to intrastate telecommunications relay services within a State and certification of the program of such State under subsection (f) of this section is in effect, the Commission shall refer such complaint to such State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Jurisdiction of Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After referring a complaint to a State under paragraph (1), the Commission shall exercise jurisdiction over such complaint only if&mdash;</p>

Any changes in such rates, terms, or conditions shall be filed no later than the first day on which the changed rates, terms, or conditions are in effect.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Waiver authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission may, after 4 years following October 17, 1990, waive the requirements of this paragraph only if&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Review of informational tariffs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the rates and charges filed by any provider of operator services under paragraph (1) appear upon review by the Commission to be unjust or unreasonable, the Commission may require such provider of operator services to do either or both of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) demonstrate that its rates and charges are just and reasonable, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) announce that its rates are available on request at the beginning of each call.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) monitor operator service rates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) determine the extent to which offerings made by providers of operator services are improvements, in terms of service quality, price, innovation, and other factors, over those available before the entry of new providers of operator services into the market;</p>

Such regulations shall include limitations on the amount of commissions or any other compensation given to aggregators by providers of operator service.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The requirement of subparagraph (A) shall not apply if, on the basis of the proceeding under paragraph (3)(A), the Commission makes (and includes in the report required by paragraph (3)(B)(iii)) a factual determination that market forces are securing rates and charges that are just and reasonable, as evidenced by rate levels, costs, complaints, service quality, and other relevant factors.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 2 of Pub. L. 101&ndash;435 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the divestiture of AT&T and decisions allowing open entry for competitors in the telephone marketplace produced a variety of new services and many new providers of existing telephone services;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the growth of competition in the telecommunications market makes it essential to ensure that safeguards are in place to assure fairness for consumers and service providers alike;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) a variety of providers of operator services now compete to win contracts to provide operator services to hotels, hospitals, airports, and other aggregators of telephone business from consumers;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the mere existence of a variety of service providers in the operator services marketplace is significant in making that market competitive only when consumers are able to make informed choices from among those service providers;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) however, often consumers have no choices in selecting a provider of operator services, and often attempts by consumers to reach their preferred long distance carrier by using a telephone billing card, credit card, or prearranged access code number are blocked;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) a number of State regulatory authorities have taken action to protect consumers using intrastate operator services;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) from January 1988 through February 1990, the Federal Communications Commission received over 4,000 complaints from consumers about operator services;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) those consumers have complained that they are denied access to the interexchange carrier of their choice, that they are deceived about the identity of the company providing operator services for their calls and the rates being charged, that they lack information on what they can do to complain about unfair treatment by an operator service provider, and that they are, accordingly, being deprived of the free choice essential to the operation of a competitive market;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the Commission has testified that its actions have been insufficient to correct the problems in the operator services industry to date; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) a combination of industry self-regulation and government regulation is required to ensure that competitive operator services are provided in a fair and reasonable manner.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Private right of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person or entity may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State, bring in an appropriate court of that State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an action based on a violation of this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin such violation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation, or to receive $500 in damages for each such violation, whichever is greater, or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If the court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection, the court may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount available under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Protection of subscriber privacy rights</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Rulemaking proceeding required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 120 days after December 20, 1991, the Commission shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding concerning the need to protect residential telephone subscribers&rsquo; privacy rights to avoid receiving telephone solicitations to which they object. The proceeding shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) compare and evaluate alternative methods and procedures (including the use of electronic databases, telephone network technologies, special directory markings, industry-based or company-specific &ldquo;do not call&rdquo; systems, and any other alternatives, individually or in combination) for their effectiveness in protecting such privacy rights, and in terms of their cost and other advantages and disadvantages;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) evaluate the categories of public and private entities that would have the capacity to establish and administer such methods and procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) consider whether different methods and procedures may apply for local telephone solicitations, such as local telephone solicitations of small businesses or holders of second class mail permits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) consider whether there is a need for additional Commission authority to further restrict telephone solicitations, including those calls exempted under subsection (a)(3) of this section, and, if such a finding is made and supported by the record, propose specific restrictions to the Congress; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) develop proposed regulations to implement the methods and procedures that the Commission determines are most effective and efficient to accomplish the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 9 months after December 20, 1991, the Commission shall conclude the rulemaking proceeding initiated under paragraph (1) and shall prescribe regulations to implement methods and procedures for protecting the privacy rights described in such paragraph in an efficient, effective, and economic manner and without the imposition of any additional charge to telephone subscribers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Use of database permitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations required by paragraph (2) may require the establishment and operation of a single national database to compile a list of telephone numbers of residential subscribers who object to receiving telephone solicitations, and to make that compiled list and parts thereof available for purchase. If the Commission determines to require such a database, such regulations shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) specify a method by which the Commission will select an entity to administer such database;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) require each common carrier providing telephone exchange service, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission, to inform subscribers for telephone exchange service of the opportunity to provide notification, in accordance with regulations established under this paragraph, that such subscriber objects to receiving telephone solicitations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) specify the methods by which each telephone subscriber shall be informed, by the common carrier that provides local exchange service to that subscriber, of (i) the subscriber's right to give or revoke a notification of an objection under subparagraph (A), and (ii) the methods by which such right may be exercised by the subscriber;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:73 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) specify the methods by which such objections shall be collected and added to the database;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) prohibit any residential subscriber from being charged for giving or revoking such notification or for being included in a database compiled under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) prohibit any person from making or transmitting a telephone solicitation to the telephone number of any subscriber included in such database;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) specify (i) the methods by which any person desiring to make or transmit telephone solicitations will obtain access to the database, by area code or local exchange prefix, as required to avoid calling the telephone numbers of subscribers included in such database; and (ii) the costs to be recovered from such persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) specify the methods for recovering, from persons accessing such database, the costs involved in identifying, collecting, updating, disseminating, and selling, and other activities relating to, the operations of the database that are incurred by the entities carrying out those activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) specify the frequency with which such database will be updated and specify the method by which such updating will take effect for purposes of compliance with the regulations prescribed under this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) be designed to enable States to use the database mechanism selected by the Commission for purposes of administering or enforcing State law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(K) prohibit the use of such database for any purpose other than compliance with the requirements of this section and any such State law and specify methods for protection of the privacy rights of persons whose numbers are included in such database; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(L) require each common carrier providing services to any person for the purpose of making telephone solicitations to notify such person of the requirements of this section and the regulations thereunder.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Considerations required for use of database method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission determines to require the database mechanism described in paragraph (3), the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in developing procedures for gaining access to the database, consider the different needs of telemarketers conducting business on a national, regional, State, or local level;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) develop a fee schedule or price structure for recouping the cost of such database that recognizes such differences and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) reflect the relative costs of providing a national, regional, State, or local list of phone numbers of subscribers who object to receiving telephone solicitations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) reflect the relative costs of providing such lists on paper or electronic media; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) not place an unreasonable financial burden on small businesses; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) consider (i) whether the needs of telemarketers operating on a local basis could be met through special markings of area white pages directories, and (ii) if such directories are needed as an adjunct to database lists prepared by area code and local exchange prefix.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Private right of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person who has received more than one telephone call within any 12-month period by or on behalf of the same entity in violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State bring in an appropriate court of that State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an action based on a violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin such violation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation, or to receive up to $500 in damages for each such violation, whichever is greater, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) both such actions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">It shall be an affirmative defense in any action brought under this paragraph that the defendant has established and implemented, with due care, reasonable practices and procedures to effectively prevent telephone solicitations in violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection. If the court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated the regulations prescribed under this subsection, the court may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount available under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Relation to subsection (b)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to permit a communication prohibited by subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Technical and procedural standards</h4>

If the court finds the defendant willfully or knowingly violated such regulations, the court may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount available under the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exclusive jurisdiction of Federal courts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The district courts of the United States, the United States courts of any territory, and the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all civil actions brought under this subsection.

Upon a proper showing, a permanent or temporary injunction or restraining order shall be granted without bond.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Investigatory powers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of bringing any civil action under this subsection, nothing in this section shall prevent the attorney general of a State, or an official or agency designated by a State, from exercising the powers conferred on the attorney general or such official by the laws of such State to conduct investigations or to administer oaths or affirmations or to compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of documentary and other evidence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Effect on State court proceedings</h4>

<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Statement of Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 2 of Pub. L. 102&ndash;243 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The use of the telephone to market goods and services to the home and other businesses is now pervasive due to the increased use of cost-effective telemarketing techniques.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Over 30,000 businesses actively telemarket goods and services to business and residential customers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) More than 300,000 solicitors call more than 18,000,000 Americans every day.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Total United States sales generated through telemarketing amounted to $435,000,000,000 in 1990, a more than four-fold increase since 1984.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Unrestricted telemarketing, however, can be an intrusive invasion of privacy and, when an emergency or medical assistance telephone line is seized, a risk to public safety.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Many consumers are outraged over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance calls to their homes from telemarketers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Over half the States now have statutes restricting various uses of the telephone for marketing, but telemarketers can evade their prohibitions through interstate operations; therefore, Federal law is needed to control residential telemarketing practices.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The Constitution does not prohibit restrictions on commercial telemarketing solicitations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Individuals&rsquo; privacy rights, public safety interests, and commercial freedoms of speech and trade must be balanced in a way that protects the privacy of individuals and permits legitimate telemarketing practices.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Evidence compiled by the Congress indicates that residential telephone subscribers consider automated or prerecorded telephone calls, regardless of the content or the initiator of the message, to be a nuisance and an invasion of privacy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Technologies that might allow consumers to avoid receiving such calls are not universally available, are costly, are unlikely to be enforced, or place an inordinate burden on the consumer.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Banning such automated or prerecorded telephone calls to the home, except when the receiving party consents to receiving the call or when such calls are necessary in an emergency situation affecting the health and safety of the consumer, is the only effective means of protecting telephone consumers from this nuisance and privacy invasion.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) While the evidence presented to the Congress indicates that automated or prerecorded calls are a nuisance and an invasion of privacy, regardless of the type of call, the Federal Communications Commission should have the flexibility to design different rules for those types of automated or prerecorded calls that it finds are not considered a nuisance or invasion of privacy, or for noncommercial calls, consistent with the free speech protections embodied in the First Amendment of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Businesses also have complained to the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission that automated or prerecorded telephone calls are a nuisance, are an invasion of privacy, and interfere with interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) The Federal Communications Commission should consider adopting reasonable restrictions on automated or prerecorded calls to businesses as well as to the home, consistent with the constitutional protections of free speech.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to put into effect a system of national regulation and review that will oversee interstate pay-per-call services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to recognize the Commission's authority to prescribe regulations and enforcement procedures and conduct oversight to afford reasonable protection to consumers of pay-per-call services and to assure that violations of Federal law do not occur.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) General authority for regulations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any common carrier assigning to a provider of pay-per-call services a telephone number with a prefix or area code designated by the Commission in accordance with subsection (b)(5) of this section shall require by contract or tariff that such provider comply with the provisions of titles II and III of the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act [15 U.S.C. 5711 et seq.; 5721 et seq.] and the regulations prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to those titles.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Information availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A common carrier that by tariff or contract assigns a telephone number with a prefix or area code designated by the Commission in accordance with subsection (b)(5) of this section to a provider of a pay-per-call service shall make readily available on request to Federal and State agencies and other interested persons&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The regulations prescribed under subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph may permit the costs of such blocking to be recovered by contract or tariff, but such costs may not be recovered from local or long-distance ratepayers. Nothing in this subsection precludes a common carrier from filing its rates and regulations regarding blocking and presubscription in its interstate tariffs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Verification of charitable status</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The rapidly developing array of Internet and other interactive computer services available to individual Americans represent an extraordinary advance in the availability of educational and informational resources to our citizens.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) These services offer users a great degree of control over the information that they receive, as well as the potential for even greater control in the future as technology develops.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Internet and other interactive computer services offer a forum for a true diversity of political discourse, unique opportunities for cultural development, and myriad avenues for intellectual activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Internet and other interactive computer services have flourished, to the benefit of all Americans, with a minimum of government regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Increasingly Americans are relying on interactive media for a variety of political, educational, cultural, and entertainment services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to promote the continued development of the Internet and other interactive computer services and other interactive media;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to encourage the development of technologies which maximize user control over what information is received by individuals, families, and schools who use the Internet and other interactive computer services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to remove disincentives for the development and utilization of blocking and filtering technologies that empower parents to restrict their children's access to objectionable or inappropriate online material; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to ensure vigorous enforcement of Federal criminal laws to deter and punish trafficking in obscenity, stalking, and harassment by means of computer.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) while custody, care, and nurture of the child resides first with the parent, the widespread availability of the Internet presents opportunities for minors to access materials through the World Wide Web in a manner that can frustrate parental supervision or control;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to date, while the industry has developed innovative ways to help parents and educators restrict material that is harmful to minors through parental control protections and self-regulation, such efforts have not provided a national solution to the problem of minors accessing harmful material on the World Wide Web;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) a prohibition on the distribution of material harmful to minors, combined with legitimate defenses, is currently the most effective and least restrictive means by which to satisfy the compelling government interest; and</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Agreements arrived at through negotiation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Voluntary negotiations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon receiving a request for interconnection, services, or network elements pursuant to section 251 of this title, an incumbent local exchange carrier may negotiate and enter into a binding agreement with the requesting telecommunications carrier or carriers without regard to the standards set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of section 251 of this title. The agreement shall include a detailed schedule of itemized charges for interconnection and each service or network element included in the agreement. The agreement, including any interconnection agreement negotiated before February 8, 1996, shall be submitted to the State commission under subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Mediation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any party negotiating an agreement under this section may, at any point in the negotiation, ask a State commission to participate in the negotiation and to mediate any differences arising in the course of the negotiation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Agreements arrived at through compulsory arbitration</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Arbitration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the period from the 135th to the 160th day (inclusive) after the date on which an incumbent local exchange carrier receives a request for negotiation under this section, the carrier or any other party to the negotiation may petition a State commission to arbitrate any open issues.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Duty of petitioner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A party that petitions a State commission under paragraph (1) shall, at the same time as it submits the petition, provide the State commission all relevant documentation concerning&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the unresolved issues;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the position of each of the parties with respect to those issues; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) any other issue discussed and resolved by the parties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A party petitioning a State commission under paragraph (1) shall provide a copy of the petition and any documentation to the other party or parties not later than the day on which the State commission receives the petition.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Opportunity to respond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A non-petitioning party to a negotiation under this section may respond to the other party's petition and provide such additional information as it wishes within 25 days after the State commission receives the petition.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Action by State commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The State commission shall limit its consideration of any petition under paragraph (1) (and any response thereto) to the issues set forth in the petition and in the response, if any, filed under paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The State commission may require the petitioning party and the responding party to provide such information as may be necessary for the State commission to reach a decision on the unresolved issues. If any party refuses or fails unreasonably to respond on a timely basis to any reasonable request from the State commission, then the State commission may proceed on the basis of the best information available to it from whatever source derived.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The State commission shall resolve each issue set forth in the petition and the response, if any, by imposing appropriate conditions as required to implement subsection (c) of this section upon the parties to the agreement, and shall conclude the resolution of any unresolved issues not later than 9 months after the date on which the local exchange carrier received the request under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Refusal to negotiate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The refusal of any other party to the negotiation to participate further in the negotiations, to cooperate with the State commission in carrying out its function as an arbitrator, or to continue to negotiate in good faith in the presence, or with the assistance, of the State commission shall be considered a failure to negotiate in good faith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Standards for arbitration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In resolving by arbitration under subsection (b) of this section any open issues and imposing conditions upon the parties to the agreement, a State commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) ensure that such resolution and conditions meet the requirements of section 251 of this title, including the regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section 251 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establish any rates for interconnection, services, or network elements according to subsection (d) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide a schedule for implementation of the terms and conditions by the parties to the agreement.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:88 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) based on the cost (determined without reference to a rate-of-return or other rate-based proceeding) of providing the interconnection or network element (whichever is applicable), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) nondiscriminatory, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may include a reasonable profit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Charges for transport and termination of traffic</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purposes of compliance by an incumbent local exchange carrier with section 251(b)(5) of this title, a State commission shall not consider the terms and conditions for reciprocal compensation to be just and reasonable unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such terms and conditions provide for the mutual and reciprocal recovery by each carrier of costs associated with the transport and termination on each carrier's network facilities of calls that originate on the network facilities of the other carrier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such terms and conditions determine such costs on the basis of a reasonable approximation of the additional costs of terminating such calls.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Rules of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This paragraph shall not be construed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to preclude arrangements that afford the mutual recovery of costs through the offsetting of reciprocal obligations, including arrangements that waive mutual recovery (such as bill-and-keep arrangements); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to authorize the Commission or any State commission to engage in any rate regulation proceeding to establish with particularity the additional costs of transporting or terminating calls, or to require carriers to maintain records with respect to the additional costs of such calls.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Wholesale prices for telecommunications services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of section 251(c)(4) of this title, a State commission shall determine wholesale rates on the basis of retail rates charged to subscribers for the telecommunications service requested, excluding the portion thereof attributable to any marketing, billing, collection, and other costs that will be avoided by the local exchange carrier.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Approval by State commission</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Approval required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any interconnection agreement adopted by negotiation or arbitration shall be submitted for approval to the State commission. A State commission to which an agreement is submitted shall approve or reject the agreement, with written findings as to any deficiencies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State commission may only reject&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an agreement (or any portion thereof) adopted by negotiation under subsection (a) of this section if it finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the agreement (or portion thereof) discriminates against a telecommunications carrier not a party to the agreement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the implementation of such agreement or portion is not consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an agreement (or any portion thereof) adopted by arbitration under subsection (b) of this section if it finds that the agreement does not meet the requirements of section 251 of this title, including the regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section 251 of this title, or the standards set forth in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Preservation of authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (2), but subject to section 253 of this title, nothing in this section shall prohibit a State commission from establishing or enforcing other requirements of State law in its review of an agreement, including requiring compliance with intrastate telecommunications service quality standards or requirements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Schedule for decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the State commission does not act to approve or reject the agreement within 90 days after submission by the parties of an agreement adopted by negotiation under subsection (a) of this section, or within 30 days after submission by the parties of an agreement adopted by arbitration under subsection (b) of this section, the agreement shall be deemed approved. No State court shall have jurisdiction to review the action of a State commission in approving or rejecting an agreement under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Commission to act if State will not act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State commission fails to act to carry out its responsibility under this section in any proceeding or other matter under this section, then the Commission shall issue an order preempting the State commission's jurisdiction of that proceeding or matter within 90 days after being notified (or taking notice) of such failure, and shall assume the responsibility of the State commission under this section with respect to the proceeding or matter and act for the State commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Review of State commission actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In a case in which a State fails to act as described in paragraph (5), the proceeding by the Commission under such paragraph and any judicial review of the Commission's actions shall be the exclusive remedies for a State commission's failure to act. In any case in which a State commission makes a determination under this section, any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate Federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section 251 of this title and this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Statements of generally available terms</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A Bell operating company may prepare and file with a State commission a statement of the terms and conditions that such company <!-- PDFPage:89 -->generally offers within that State to comply with the requirements of section 251 of this title and the regulations thereunder and the standards applicable under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) State commission review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State commission may not approve such statement unless such statement complies with subsection (d) of this section and section 251 of this title and the regulations thereunder.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Schedule for review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State commission to which a statement is submitted shall, not later than 60 days after the date of such submission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) complete the review of such statement under paragraph (2) (including any reconsideration thereof), unless the submitting carrier agrees to an extension of the period for such review; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) permit such statement to take effect.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Authority to continue review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (3) shall not preclude the State commission from continuing to review a statement that has been permitted to take effect under subparagraph (B) of such paragraph or from approving or disapproving such statement under paragraph (2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Joint Board and the Commission shall base policies for the preservation and advancement of universal service on the following principles:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Quality and rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Quality services should be available at just, reasonable, and affordable rates.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Access to advanced services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Access to advanced telecommunications and information services should be provided in all regions of the Nation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Access in rural and high cost areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Consumers in all regions of the Nation, including low-income consumers and those in rural, insular, and high cost areas, should have access to telecommunications and information services, including interexchange services and advanced telecommunications and information services, that are reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban areas and that are available at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Equitable and nondiscriminatory contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All providers of telecommunications services should make an equitable and nondiscriminatory contribution to the preservation and advancement of universal service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Specific and predictable support mechanisms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There should be specific, predictable and sufficient Federal and State mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Access to advanced telecommunications services for schools, health care, and libraries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Elementary and secondary schools and classrooms, health care providers, and libraries should have access to advanced telecommunications services as described in subsection (h) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Additional principles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such other principles as the Joint Board and the Commission determine are necessary and appropriate for the protection of the public interest, convenience, and necessity and are consistent with this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definition</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Universal service is an evolving level of telecommunications services that the Commission shall establish periodically under this section, taking into account advances in telecommunications and information technologies and services. The Joint Board in recommending, and the Commission in establishing, the definition of the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms shall consider the extent to which such telecommunications services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are essential to education, public health, or public safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) have, through the operation of market choices by customers, been subscribed to by a substantial majority of residential customers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) are being deployed in public telecommunications networks by telecommunications carriers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) are consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Alterations and modifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Joint Board may, from time to time, recommend to the Commission modifications in the definition of the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:91 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to the services included in the definition of universal service under paragraph (1), the Commission may designate additional services for such support mechanisms for schools, libraries, and health care providers for the purposes of subsection (h) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Telecommunications carrier contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, to the specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms established by the Commission to preserve and advance universal service. The Commission may exempt a carrier or class of carriers from this requirement if the carrier's telecommunications activities are limited to such an extent that the level of such carrier's contribution to the preservation and advancement of universal service would be de minimis. Any other provider of interstate telecommunications may be required to contribute to the preservation and advancement of universal service if the public interest so requires.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Universal service support</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After the date on which Commission regulations implementing this section take effect, only an eligible telecommunications carrier designated under section 214(e) of this title shall be eligible to receive specific Federal universal service support. A carrier that receives such support shall use that support only for the provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities and services for which the support is intended. Any such support should be explicit and sufficient to achieve the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) State authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State may adopt regulations not inconsistent with the Commission's rules to preserve and advance universal service. Every telecommunications carrier that provides intrastate telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, in a manner determined by the State to the preservation and advancement of universal service in that State. A State may adopt regulations to provide for additional definitions and standards to preserve and advance universal service within that State only to the extent that such regulations adopt additional specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms to support such definitions or standards that do not rely on or burden Federal universal service support mechanisms.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Interexchange and interstate services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 6 months after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall adopt rules to require that the rates charged by providers of interexchange telecommunications services to subscribers in rural and high cost areas shall be no higher than the rates charged by each such provider to its subscribers in urban areas. Such rules shall also require that a provider of interstate interexchange telecommunications services shall provide such services to its subscribers in each State at rates no higher than the rates charged to its subscribers in any other State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Telecommunications services for certain providers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A telecommunications carrier shall, upon receiving a bona fide request, provide telecommunications services which are necessary for the provision of health care services in a State, including instruction relating to such services, to any public or nonprofit health care provider that serves persons who reside in rural areas in that State at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas in that State. A telecommunications carrier providing service under this paragraph shall be entitled to have an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the rates for services provided to health care providers for rural areas in a State and the rates for similar services provided to other customers in comparable rural areas in that State treated as a service obligation as a part of its obligation to participate in the mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Educational providers and libraries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">All telecommunications carriers serving a geographic area shall, upon a bona fide request for any of its services that are within the definition of universal service under subsection (c)(3) of this section, provide such services to elementary schools, secondary schools, and libraries for educational purposes at rates less than the amounts charged for similar services to other parties. The discount shall be an amount that the Commission, with respect to interstate services, and the States, with respect to intrastate services, determine is appropriate and necessary to ensure affordable access to and use of such services by such entities. A telecommunications carrier providing service under this paragraph shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) have an amount equal to the amount of the discount treated as an offset to its obligation to contribute to the mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, receive reimbursement utilizing the support mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Advanced services</h4>

Nothing in this subparagraph precludes a State from issuing an order requiring intraLATA toll dialing parity in that State prior to either such date so long as such order does not take effect until after the earlier of either such dates.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Exception for previously authorized activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Neither subsection (a) of this section nor section 273 of this title shall prohibit a Bell operating company or affiliate from engaging, at any time after February 8, 1996, in any activity to the extent authorized by, and subject to the terms and conditions contained in, an order entered by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia pursuant to section VII or VIII(C) of the AT&T Consent Decree if such order was entered on or before February 8, 1996, to the extent such order is not reversed or vacated on appeal.

<!-- PDFPage:103 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsection (g) of this section are intended to be narrowly construed. The interLATA services provided under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of subsection (g)(1) of this section are limited to those interLATA transmissions incidental to the provision by a Bell operating company or its affiliate of video, audio, and other programming services that the company or its affiliate is engaged in providing to the public. The Commission shall ensure that the provision of services authorized under subsection (g) of this section by a Bell operating company or its affiliate will not adversely affect telephone exchange service ratepayers or competition in any telecommunications market.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Additional definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In-region State</h4>

The Commission shall not establish itself as a party to the dispute resolution process. Such dispute resolution process shall permit any funding party to resolve a dispute with the entity conducting the activity that significantly affects such funding party's interests, in an open, nondiscriminatory, and unbiased fashion, within 30 days after the filing of such dispute. Such disputes may be filed within 15 days after the date the funding party receives a response to its comments from the entity conducting the activity.
