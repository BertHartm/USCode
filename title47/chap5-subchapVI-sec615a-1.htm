<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Parity for IP-enabled voice service providers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An IP-enabled voice service provider that seeks capabilities to provide 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 and enhanced 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 service from an entity with ownership or control over such capabilities, to comply with its obligations under subsection (a), shall, for the exclusive purpose of complying with such obligations, have a right of access to such capabilities, including interconnection, to provide 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 and enhanced 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 service on the same rates, terms, and conditions that are provided to a provider of commercial mobile service (as such term is defined in section 332(d) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(d))), subject to such regulations as the Commission prescribes under subsection (c).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) within 90 days after the date of enactment of the New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008, shall issue regulations implementing such Act, including regulations that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) ensure that IP-enabled voice service providers have the ability to exercise their rights under subsection (b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) take into account any technical, network security, or information privacy requirements that are specific to IP-enabled voice services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provide, with respect to any capabilities that are not required to be made available to a commercial mobile service provider but that the Commission determines under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph or paragraph (3) are necessary for an IP-enabled voice service provider to comply with its obligations under subsection (a), that such capabilities shall be available at the same rates, terms, and conditions as would apply if such capabilities were made available to a commercial mobile service provider;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall require IP-enabled voice service providers to which the regulations apply to register with the Commission and to establish a point of contact for public safety and government officials relative to 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 and enhanced 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 service and access; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) may modify such regulations from time to time, as necessitated by changes in the market or technology, to ensure the ability of an IP-enabled voice service provider to comply with its obligations under subsection (a) and to exercise its rights under subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Delegation of enforcement to State commissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may delegate authority to enforce the regulations issued under subsection (c) to State commissions or other State or local agencies or programs with jurisdiction over emergency communications. Nothing in this section is intended to alter the authority of State commissions or other State or local agencies with jurisdiction over emergency communications, provided that the exercise of such authority is not inconsistent with Federal law or Commission requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Implementation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitation</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) State authority over fees</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this Act, the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.), the New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008, or any Commission regulation or order shall prevent the imposition and collection of a fee or charge applicable to commercial mobile services or IP-enabled voice services specifically designated by a State, political subdivision thereof, Indian tribe, or village or regional corporation serving a region established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, as amended (85 Stat. 688) [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.]&nbsp;<sup><a href="#615a-1_1_target" name="615a-1_1">1</a></sup> for the support or implementation of 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 or enhanced 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 services, provided that the fee or charge is obligated or expended only in support of 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 and enhanced 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 services, or enhancements of such services, as specified in the provision of State or local law adopting the fee or charge. For each class of subscribers to IP-enabled voice services, the fee or charge may not exceed the amount of any such fee or charge applicable to the same class of subscribers to telecommunications services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Fee accountability report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To ensure efficiency, transparency, and accountability in the collection and expenditure of a fee or charge for the support or implementation of 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 or enhanced 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 services, the Commission shall submit a report within 1 year after the date of enactment of the New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008, and annually thereafter, to the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives detailing the status in each State of the collection and distribution of such fees or charges, and including findings on the amount of revenues obligated or expended by each State or political subdivision thereof for any purpose other than the purpose for which any such fees or charges are specified.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Availability of PSAP information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may compile a list of public safety answering point contact information, contact information for providers of selective routers, testing procedures, classes and types of services supported by public safety answering points, and other information concerning 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 and enhanced 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 elements, for the purpose of assisting IP-enabled voice service providers in complying with this section, and may make any portion of such information available to telecommunications carriers, wireless carriers, IP-enabled voice service providers, other emergency service providers, or the vendors to or agents of any such carriers or providers, if such availability would improve public safety.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Development of standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall work cooperatively with public safety organizations, industry participants, and the E&ndash;911 Implementation Coordination Office to develop best practices that promote consistency, where appropriate, including procedures for&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) public safety answering point certification and testing requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) validation procedures for inputting and updating location information in relevant databases; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the format for delivering address information to public safety answering points.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in the New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008 shall be construed as altering, delaying, or otherwise limiting the ability of the Commission to enforce the Federal actions taken or rules adopted obligating an IP-enabled voice service provider to provide 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 or enhanced 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 service as of the date of enactment of the New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008.</p>
