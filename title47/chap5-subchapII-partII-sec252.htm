<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Agreements arrived at through negotiation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Voluntary negotiations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon receiving a request for interconnection, services, or network elements pursuant to section 251 of this title, an incumbent local exchange carrier may negotiate and enter into a binding agreement with the requesting telecommunications carrier or carriers without regard to the standards set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of section 251 of this title. The agreement shall include a detailed schedule of itemized charges for interconnection and each service or network element included in the agreement. The agreement, including any interconnection agreement negotiated before February 8, 1996, shall be submitted to the State commission under subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Mediation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any party negotiating an agreement under this section may, at any point in the negotiation, ask a State commission to participate in the negotiation and to mediate any differences arising in the course of the negotiation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Agreements arrived at through compulsory arbitration</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Arbitration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the period from the 135th to the 160th day (inclusive) after the date on which an incumbent local exchange carrier receives a request for negotiation under this section, the carrier or any other party to the negotiation may petition a State commission to arbitrate any open issues.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Duty of petitioner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A party that petitions a State commission under paragraph (1) shall, at the same time as it submits the petition, provide the State commission all relevant documentation concerning&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the unresolved issues;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the position of each of the parties with respect to those issues; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) any other issue discussed and resolved by the parties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A party petitioning a State commission under paragraph (1) shall provide a copy of the petition and any documentation to the other party or parties not later than the day on which the State commission receives the petition.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Opportunity to respond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A non-petitioning party to a negotiation under this section may respond to the other party's petition and provide such additional information as it wishes within 25 days after the State commission receives the petition.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Action by State commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The State commission shall limit its consideration of any petition under paragraph (1) (and any response thereto) to the issues set forth in the petition and in the response, if any, filed under paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The State commission may require the petitioning party and the responding party to provide such information as may be necessary for the State commission to reach a decision on the unresolved issues. If any party refuses or fails unreasonably to respond on a timely basis to any reasonable request from the State commission, then the State commission may proceed on the basis of the best information available to it from whatever source derived.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:83 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The State commission shall resolve each issue set forth in the petition and the response, if any, by imposing appropriate conditions as required to implement subsection (c) of this section upon the parties to the agreement, and shall conclude the resolution of any unresolved issues not later than 9 months after the date on which the local exchange carrier received the request under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Refusal to negotiate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The refusal of any other party to the negotiation to participate further in the negotiations, to cooperate with the State commission in carrying out its function as an arbitrator, or to continue to negotiate in good faith in the presence, or with the assistance, of the State commission shall be considered a failure to negotiate in good faith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Standards for arbitration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In resolving by arbitration under subsection (b) of this section any open issues and imposing conditions upon the parties to the agreement, a State commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) ensure that such resolution and conditions meet the requirements of section 251 of this title, including the regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section 251 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establish any rates for interconnection, services, or network elements according to subsection (d) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide a schedule for implementation of the terms and conditions by the parties to the agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Pricing standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Interconnection and network element charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Determinations by a State commission of the just and reasonable rate for the interconnection of facilities and equipment for purposes of subsection (c)(2) of section 251 of this title, and the just and reasonable rate for network elements for purposes of subsection (c)(3) of such section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) based on the cost (determined without reference to a rate-of-return or other rate-based proceeding) of providing the interconnection or network element (whichever is applicable), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) nondiscriminatory, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may include a reasonable profit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Charges for transport and termination of traffic</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purposes of compliance by an incumbent local exchange carrier with section 251(b)(5) of this title, a State commission shall not consider the terms and conditions for reciprocal compensation to be just and reasonable unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such terms and conditions provide for the mutual and reciprocal recovery by each carrier of costs associated with the transport and termination on each carrier's network facilities of calls that originate on the network facilities of the other carrier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such terms and conditions determine such costs on the basis of a reasonable approximation of the additional costs of terminating such calls.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Rules of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This paragraph shall not be construed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to preclude arrangements that afford the mutual recovery of costs through the offsetting of reciprocal obligations, including arrangements that waive mutual recovery (such as bill-and-keep arrangements); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to authorize the Commission or any State commission to engage in any rate regulation proceeding to establish with particularity the additional costs of transporting or terminating calls, or to require carriers to maintain records with respect to the additional costs of such calls.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Wholesale prices for telecommunications services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of section 251(c)(4) of this title, a State commission shall determine wholesale rates on the basis of retail rates charged to subscribers for the telecommunications service requested, excluding the portion thereof attributable to any marketing, billing, collection, and other costs that will be avoided by the local exchange carrier.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Approval by State commission</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Approval required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any interconnection agreement adopted by negotiation or arbitration shall be submitted for approval to the State commission. A State commission to which an agreement is submitted shall approve or reject the agreement, with written findings as to any deficiencies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Grounds for rejection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State commission may only reject&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an agreement (or any portion thereof) adopted by negotiation under subsection (a) of this section if it finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the agreement (or portion thereof) discriminates against a telecommunications carrier not a party to the agreement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the implementation of such agreement or portion is not consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an agreement (or any portion thereof) adopted by arbitration under subsection (b) of this section if it finds that the agreement does not meet the requirements of section 251 of this title, including the regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section 251 of this title, or the standards set forth in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Preservation of authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (2), but subject to section 253 of this title, nothing in this section shall prohibit a State commission from establishing or enforcing other requirements of State law in its review of an agreement, including requiring compliance with intrastate telecommunications service quality standards or requirements.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:84 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Schedule for decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the State commission does not act to approve or reject the agreement within 90 days after submission by the parties of an agreement adopted by negotiation under subsection (a) of this section, or within 30 days after submission by the parties of an agreement adopted by arbitration under subsection (b) of this section, the agreement shall be deemed approved. No State court shall have jurisdiction to review the action of a State commission in approving or rejecting an agreement under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Commission to act if State will not act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State commission fails to act to carry out its responsibility under this section in any proceeding or other matter under this section, then the Commission shall issue an order preempting the State commission's jurisdiction of that proceeding or matter within 90 days after being notified (or taking notice) of such failure, and shall assume the responsibility of the State commission under this section with respect to the proceeding or matter and act for the State commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Review of State commission actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In a case in which a State fails to act as described in paragraph (5), the proceeding by the Commission under such paragraph and any judicial review of the Commission's actions shall be the exclusive remedies for a State commission's failure to act. In any case in which a State commission makes a determination under this section, any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate Federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section 251 of this title and this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Statements of generally available terms</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A Bell operating company may prepare and file with a State commission a statement of the terms and conditions that such company generally offers within that State to comply with the requirements of section 251 of this title and the regulations thereunder and the standards applicable under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) State commission review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State commission may not approve such statement unless such statement complies with subsection (d) of this section and section 251 of this title and the regulations thereunder.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Schedule for review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State commission to which a statement is submitted shall, not later than 60 days after the date of such submission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) complete the review of such statement under paragraph (2) (including any reconsideration thereof), unless the submitting carrier agrees to an extension of the period for such review; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) permit such statement to take effect.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Authority to continue review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (3) shall not preclude the State commission from continuing to review a statement that has been permitted to take effect under subparagraph (B) of such paragraph or from approving or disapproving such statement under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Duty to negotiate not affected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The submission or approval of a statement under this subsection shall not relieve a Bell operating company of its duty to negotiate the terms and conditions of an agreement under section 251 of this title.</p>
