<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section and sections 1007(a) and 1008(b) and (d) of this title, a telecommunications carrier shall ensure that its equipment, facilities, or services that provide a customer or subscriber with the ability to originate, terminate, or direct communications are capable of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) expeditiously isolating and enabling the government, pursuant to a court order or other lawful authorization, to intercept, to the exclusion of any other communications, all wire and electronic communications carried by the carrier within a service area to or from equipment, facilities, or services of a subscriber of such carrier concurrently with their transmission to or from the subscriber's equipment, facility, or service, or at such later time as may be acceptable to the government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) expeditiously isolating and enabling the government, pursuant to a court order or other lawful authorization, to access call-identifying information that is reasonably available to the carrier&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) before, during, or immediately after the transmission of a wire or electronic communication (or at such later time as may be acceptable to the government); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in a manner that allows it to be associated with the communication to which it pertains,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">except that, with regard to information acquired solely pursuant to the authority for pen registers and trap and trace devices (as defined in section 3127 of title 18), such call-identifying information shall not include any information that may disclose the physical location of the subscriber (except to the extent that the location may be determined from the telephone number);</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) facilitating authorized communications interceptions and access to call-identifying information unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference with any subscriber's telecommunications service and in a manner that protects&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Mobile service assistance requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A telecommunications carrier that is a provider of commercial mobile service (as defined in section 332(d) of this title) offering a feature or service that allows subscribers to redirect, hand off, or assign their wire or electronic communications to another service area or another service provider or to utilize facilities in another service area or of another service provider shall ensure that, when the carrier that had been providing assistance for the interception of wire or electronic communications or access to call-identifying information pursuant to a court order or lawful authorization no longer has access to the content of such communications or call-identifying information within the service area in which interception has been occurring as a result of the subscriber's use of such a feature or service, information is made available to the government (before, during, or immediately after the transfer of such communications) identifying the provider of a wire or electronic communication service that has acquired access to the communications.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 1 year after October 25, 1994, after consulting with State and local law enforcement agencies, telecommunications carriers, providers of telecommunications support services, and manufacturers of telecommunications equipment, and after notice and comment, the Attorney General shall publish in the Federal Register and provide to appropriate telecommunications industry associations and standard-setting organizations&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) notice of the maximum capacity required to accommodate all of the communication interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices that the Attorney General estimates that government agencies authorized to conduct electronic surveillance may conduct and use simultaneously after the date that is 4 years after October 25, 1994.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Basis of notices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The notices issued under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall identify, to the maximum extent practicable, the capacity required at specific geographic locations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compliance with capacity notices</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Initial capacity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 3 years after the publication by the Attorney General of a notice of capacity requirements or within 4 years after October 25, 1994, whichever is longer, a telecommunications carrier shall, subject to subsection (e) of this section, ensure that its systems are capable of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) expanding to the maximum capacity set forth in the notice under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Expansion to maximum capacity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the date described in paragraph (1), a telecommunications carrier shall, subject to <!-- PDFPage:303 -->subsection (e) of this section, ensure that it can accommodate expeditiously any increase in the actual number of communication interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices that authorized agencies may seek to conduct and use, up to the maximum capacity requirement set forth in the notice under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notices of increased maximum capacity requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice</h4>

The Commission shall make such determination within 1 year after the date such petition is filed. In making such determination, the Commission shall determine whether compliance would impose significant difficulty or expense on the carrier or on the users of the carrier's systems and shall consider the following factors:</p>
