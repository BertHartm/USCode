<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) expeditiously isolating and enabling the government, pursuant to a court order or other lawful authorization, to intercept, to the exclusion of any other communications, all wire and electronic communications carried by the carrier within a service area to or from equipment, facilities, or services of a subscriber of such carrier concurrently with their transmission to or from the subscriber's equipment, facility, or service, or at such later time as may be acceptable to the government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) expeditiously isolating and enabling the government, pursuant to a court order or other lawful authorization, to access call-identifying information that is reasonably available to the carrier&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) before, during, or immediately after the transmission of a wire or electronic communication (or at such later time as may be acceptable to the government); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in a manner that allows it to be associated with the communication to which it pertains,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">except that, with regard to information acquired solely pursuant to the authority for pen registers and trap and trace devices (as defined in section 3127 of title 18), such call-identifying information shall not include any information that may disclose the physical location of the subscriber (except to the extent that the location may be determined from the telephone number);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) delivering intercepted communications and call-identifying information to the government, pursuant to a court order or other lawful authorization, in a format such that they may be transmitted by means of equipment, facilities, or services procured by the government to a location other than the premises of the carrier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) facilitating authorized communications interceptions and access to call-identifying information unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference with any subscriber's telecommunications service and in a manner that protects&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 1 year after October 25, 1994, after consulting with State and local law enforcement agencies, telecommunications carriers, providers of telecommunications support services, and manufacturers of telecommunications equipment, and after notice and comment, the Attorney General shall publish in the Federal Register and provide to appropriate telecommunications industry associations and standard-setting organizations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) notice of the actual number of communication interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices, representing a portion of the maximum capacity set forth under subparagraph (B), that the Attorney General estimates that government agencies authorized to conduct electronic surveillance may conduct and use simultaneously by the date that is 4 years after October 25, 1994; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) notice of the maximum capacity required to accommodate all of the communication interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices that the Attorney General estimates that government agencies authorized to conduct electronic surveillance may conduct and use simultaneously after the date that is 4 years after October 25, 1994.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Basis of notices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The notices issued under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may be based upon the type of equipment, type of service, number of subscribers, type or size or&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1003_1_target" name="1003_1">1</a></sup> carrier, nature of service area, or any other measure; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall identify, to the maximum extent practicable, the capacity required at specific geographic locations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compliance with capacity notices</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Initial capacity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 3 years after the publication by the Attorney General of a notice of capacity requirements or within 4 years after October 25, 1994, whichever is longer, a telecommunications carrier shall, subject to subsection (e) of this section, ensure that its systems are capable of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) accommodating simultaneously the number of interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices set forth in the notice under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) expanding to the maximum capacity set forth in the notice under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Expansion to maximum capacity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the date described in paragraph (1), a telecommunications carrier shall, subject to subsection (e) of this section, ensure that it can accommodate expeditiously any increase in the actual number of communication interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices that authorized agencies may seek to conduct and use, up to the maximum capacity requirement set forth in the notice under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notices of increased maximum capacity requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall periodically publish in the Federal Register, after notice and comment, notice of any necessary increases in the maximum capacity requirement set forth in the notice under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 3 years after notice of increased maximum capacity requirements is published under paragraph (1), or within such longer time period as the Attorney General may <!-- PDFPage:216 -->specify, a telecommunications carrier shall, subject to subsection (e) of this section, ensure that its systems are capable of expanding to the increased maximum capacity set forth in the notice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Carrier statement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 180 days after the publication by the Attorney General of a notice of capacity requirements pursuant to subsection (a) or (c) of this section, a telecommunications carrier shall submit to the Attorney General a statement identifying any of its systems or services that do not have the capacity to accommodate simultaneously the number of interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices set forth in the notice under such subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reimbursement required for compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General shall review the statements submitted under subsection (d) of this section and may, subject to the availability of appropriations, agree to reimburse a telecommunications carrier for costs directly associated with modifications to attain such capacity requirement that are determined to be reasonable in accordance with section 1008(e) of this title. Until the Attorney General agrees to reimburse such carrier for such modification, such carrier shall be considered to be in compliance with the capacity notices under subsection (a) or (c) of this section.</p>
