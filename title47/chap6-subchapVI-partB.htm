In securing such privatizations, the following criteria shall be applied as licensing criteria for purposes of part A of this subchapter:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Dates for privatization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Privatization shall be obtained in accordance with the criteria of this subchapter of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) INTELSAT as soon as practicable, but no later than April 1, 2001; and</p>

The successor entities and separated entities of INTELSAT and Inmarsat shall conduct an initial public offering in accordance with paragraph (5) to achieve such independence. Such offering shall substantially dilute the aggregate ownership of such entities by such signatories or former signatories. In determining whether a public offering attains such substantial dilution, the Commission shall take into account the purposes and intent, privatization criteria, and other provisions of this subchapter, as well as market conditions. No intergovernmental organization, including INTELSAT or Inmarsat, shall have&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an ownership interest in INTELSAT or the successor or separated entities of INTELSAT; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) more than minimal ownership interest in Inmarsat or the successor or separated entities of Inmarsat.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Termination of privileges and immunities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The preferential treatment of INTELSAT and Inmarsat shall not be extended to any successor entity or separated entity of INTELSAT or Inmarsat. Such preferential treatment includes&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) privileges or immunities or other competitive advantages of the type accorded INTELSAT and Inmarsat and their signatories through the terms and operation of the INTELSAT Agreement and the associated Headquarters Agreement and the Inmarsat Convention; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) preferential access to orbital locations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Access to new, or renewal of access to, orbital locations shall be subject to the legal or regulatory processes of a national government that applies due diligence requirements intended to prevent the warehousing of orbital locations.</p>

No member of the board of directors of any successor or separated entity shall be a director, employee, officer or manager of any intergovernmental organization remaining after the privatization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Any successor entity or separated entity shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) have a board of directors with a fiduciary obligation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) have no officers or managers who are officers or managers of any signatories or former signatories; and</p>
