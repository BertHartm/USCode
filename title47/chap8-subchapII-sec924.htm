<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exceptions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the reassignment would seriously jeopardize public health or safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the reassignment will result in costs to the Federal Government that are excessive in relation to the benefits that may be obtained from commercial or other non-Federal uses of the reassigned frequency; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the reassignment will disrupt the existing use of a Federal Government band of frequencies by amateur radio licensees.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Criteria for substituted frequencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a frequency may not be substituted for a frequency identified and recommended by the report of the Secretary under section 923(a) of this title unless the substituted frequency also meets each of the criteria specified by section 923(a) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the President determines that any action cannot be completed by the delayed effective date recommended by the Secretary pursuant to section 923(e) of this title, or that such an action by such date would result in a frequency being unused as a consequence of the Commission's plan under section 925 of this title, the President may&mdash;</p>
