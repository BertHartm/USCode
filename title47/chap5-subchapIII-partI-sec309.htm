<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Considerations in granting application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the provisions of this section, the Commission shall determine, in the case of each application filed with it to which section 308 of this title applies, whether the public interest, convenience, and necessity will be served by the granting of such application, and, if the Commission, upon examination of such application and upon consideration of such other matters as the Commission may officially notice, shall find that public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served by the granting thereof, it shall grant such application.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Time of granting application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, no such application&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for an instrument of authorization in the case of a station in the broadcasting or common carrier services, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for an instrument of authorization in the case of a station in any of the following categories:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) industrial radio positioning stations for which frequencies are assigned on an exclusive basis,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) aeronautical fixed stations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) such other stations or classes of stations, not in the broadcasting or common carrier services, as the Commission shall by rule prescribe,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be granted by the Commission earlier than thirty days following issuance of public notice by the Commission of the acceptance for filing <!-- PDFPage:123 -->of such application or of any substantial amendment thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Applications not affected by subsection (b)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (b) of this section shall not apply&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to any minor amendment of an application to which such subsection is applicable, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to any application for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a minor change in the facilities of an authorized station,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) consent to an involuntary assignment or transfer under section 310(b) of this title or to an assignment or transfer thereunder which does not involve a substantial change in ownership or control,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a license under section 319(c) of this title or, pending application for or grant of such license, any special or temporary authorization to permit interim operation to facilitate completion of authorized construction or to provide substantially the same service as would be authorized by such license,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) extension of time to complete construction of authorized facilities,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) an authorization of facilities for remote pickups, studio links and similar facilities for use in the operation of a broadcast station,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) an authorization under any of the proviso clauses of section 308(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Petition to deny application; time; contents; reply; findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any party in interest may file with the Commission a petition to deny any application (whether as originally filed or as amended) to which subsection (b) of this section applies at any time prior to the day of Commission grant thereof without hearing or the day of formal designation thereof for hearing; except that with respect to any classification of applications, the Commission from time to time by rule may specify a shorter period (no less than thirty days following the issuance of public notice by the Commission of the acceptance for filing of such application or of any substantial amendment thereof), which shorter period shall be reasonably related to the time when the applications would normally be reached for processing. The petitioner shall serve a copy of such petition on the applicant. The petition shall contain specific allegations of fact sufficient to show that the petitioner is a party in interest and that a grant of the application would be prima facie inconsistent with subsection (a) of this section (or subsection (k) of this section in the case of renewal of any broadcast station license). Such allegations of fact shall, except for those of which official notice may be taken, be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof. The applicant shall be given the opportunity to file a reply in which allegations of fact or denials thereof shall similarly be supported by affidavit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Commission finds on the basis of the application, the pleadings filed, or other matters which it may officially notice that there are no substantial and material questions of fact and that a grant of the application would be consistent with subsection (a) of this section (or subsection (k) of this section in the case of renewal of any broadcast station license), it shall make the grant, deny the petition, and issue a concise statement of the reasons for denying the petition, which statement shall dispose of all substantial issues raised by the petition. If a substantial and material question of fact is presented or if the Commission for any reason is unable to find that grant of the application would be consistent with subsection (a) of this section (or subsection (k) of this section in the case of renewal of any broadcast station license), it shall proceed as provided in subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Hearings; intervention; evidence; burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, in the case of any application to which subsection (a) of this section applies, a substantial and material question of fact is presented or the Commission for any reason is unable to make the finding specified in such subsection, it shall formally designate the application for hearing on the ground or reasons then obtaining and shall forthwith notify the applicant and all other known parties in interest of such action and the grounds and reasons therefor, specifying with particularity the matters and things in issue but not including issues or requirements phrased generally. When the Commission has so designated an application for hearing the parties in interest, if any, who are not notified by the Commission of such action may acquire the status of a party to the proceeding thereon by filing a petition for intervention showing the basis for their interest not more than thirty days after publication of the hearing issues or any substantial amendment thereto in the Federal Register. Any hearing subsequently held upon such application shall be a full hearing in which the applicant and all other parties in interest shall be permitted to participate. The burden of proceeding with the introduction of evidence and the burden of proof shall be upon the applicant, except that with respect to any issue presented by a petition to deny or a petition to enlarge the issues, such burdens shall be as determined by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Temporary authorization of temporary operations under subsection (b)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When an application subject to subsection (b) of this section has been filed, the Commission, notwithstanding the requirements of such subsection, may, if the grant of such application is otherwise authorized by law and if it finds that there are extraordinary circumstances requiring temporary operations in the public interest and that delay in the institution of such temporary operations would seriously prejudice the public interest, grant a temporary authorization, accompanied by a statement of its reasons therefor, to permit such temporary operations for a <!-- PDFPage:124 -->period not exceeding 180 days, and upon making like findings may extend such temporary authorization for additional periods not to exceed 180 days. When any such grant of a temporary authorization is made, the Commission shall give expeditious treatment to any timely filed petition to deny such application and to any petition for rehearing of such grant filed under section 405 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Classification of applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission is authorized to adopt reasonable classifications of applications and amendments in order to effectuate the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Form and conditions of station licenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such station licenses as the Commission may grant shall be in such general form as it may prescribe, but each license shall contain, in addition to other provisions, a statement of the following conditions to which such license shall be subject: (1) The station license shall not vest in the licensee any right to operate the station nor any right in the use of the frequencies designated in the license beyond the term thereof nor in any other manner than authorized therein; (2) neither the license nor the right granted thereunder shall be assigned or otherwise transferred in violation of this chapter; (3) every license issued under this chapter shall be subject in terms to the right of use or control conferred by section 606 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Random selection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <cap-smallcap>General authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in paragraph (5), if there is more than one application for any initial license or construction permit, then the Commission shall have the authority to grant such license or permit to a qualified applicant through the use of a system of random selection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No license or construction permit shall be granted to an applicant selected pursuant to paragraph (1) unless the Commission determines the qualifications of such applicant pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and section 308(b) of this title. When substantial and material questions of fact exist concerning such qualifications, the Commission shall conduct a hearing in order to make such determinations. For the purpose of making such determinations, the Commission may, by rule, and notwithstanding any other provision of law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) adopt procedures for the submission of all or part of the evidence in written form;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) delegate the function of presiding at the taking of written evidence to Commission employees other than administrative law judges; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) omit the determination required by subsection (a) of this section with respect to any application other than the one selected pursuant to paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Commission shall establish rules and procedures to ensure that, in the administration of any system of random selection under this subsection used for granting licenses or construction permits for any media of mass communications, significant preferences will be granted to applicants or groups of applicants, the grant to which of the license or permit would increase the diversification of ownership of the media of mass communications. To further diversify the ownership of the media of mass communications, an additional significant preference shall be granted to any applicant controlled by a member or members of a minority group.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission shall have authority to require each qualified applicant seeking a significant preference under subparagraph (A) to submit to the Commission such information as may be necessary to enable the Commission to make a determination regarding whether such applicant shall be granted such preference. Such information shall be submitted in such form, at such times, and in accordance with such procedures, as the Commission may require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The term &ldquo;media of mass communications&rdquo; includes television, radio, cable television, multipoint distribution service, direct broadcast satellite service, and other services, the licensed facilities of which may be substantially devoted toward providing programming or other information services within the editorial control of the licensee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The term &ldquo;minority group&rdquo; includes Blacks, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asians, and Pacific Islanders.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Commission shall, after notice and opportunity for hearing, prescribe rules establishing a system of random selection for use by the Commission under this subsection in any instance in which the Commission, in its discretion, determines that such use is appropriate for the granting of any license or permit in accordance with paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission shall have authority to amend such rules from time to time to the extent necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection. Any such amendment shall be made after notice and opportunity for hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Not later than 180 days after August 10, 1993, the Commission shall prescribe such transfer disclosures and antitrafficking restrictions and payment schedules as are necessary to prevent the unjust enrichment of recipients of licenses or permits as a result of the methods employed to issue licenses under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <cap-smallcap>Termination of authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Commission shall not issue any license or permit using a system of random selection under this subsection after July 1, 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to licenses or permits for stations described in section 397(6) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Use of competitive bidding</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, consistent with the obligations described in paragraph (6)(E), mutually exclusive applications are accepted for any initial license or construction permit, then, except as provided in paragraph (2), the Commission shall grant the license or permit to a qualified applicant through a system of competitive bidding that meets the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The competitive bidding authority granted by this subsection shall not apply to licenses <!-- PDFPage:125 -->or construction permits issued by the Commission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for public safety radio services, including private internal radio services used by State and local governments and non-government entities and including emergency road services provided by not-for-profit organizations, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) are used to protect the safety of life, health, or property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) are not made commercially available to the public;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for initial licenses or construction permits for digital television service given to existing terrestrial broadcast licensees to replace their analog television service licenses; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) for stations described in section 397(6) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Design of systems of competitive bidding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each class of licenses or permits that the Commission grants through the use of a competitive bidding system, the Commission shall, by regulation, establish a competitive bidding methodology. The Commission shall seek to design and test multiple alternative methodologies under appropriate circumstances. The Commission shall, directly or by contract, provide for the design and conduct (for purposes of testing) of competitive bidding using a contingent combinatorial bidding system that permits prospective bidders to bid on combinations or groups of licenses in a single bid and to enter multiple alternative bids within a single bidding round. In identifying classes of licenses and permits to be issued by competitive bidding, in specifying eligibility and other characteristics of such licenses and permits, and in designing the methodologies for use under this subsection, the Commission shall include safeguards to protect the public interest in the use of the spectrum and shall seek to promote the purposes specified in section 151 of this title and the following objectives:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the development and rapid deployment of new technologies, products, and services for the benefit of the public, including those residing in rural areas, without administrative or judicial delays;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) promoting economic opportunity and competition and ensuring that new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American people by avoiding excessive concentration of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) recovery for the public of a portion of the value of the public spectrum resource made available for commercial use and avoidance of unjust enrichment through the methods employed to award uses of that resource;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) efficient and intensive use of the electromagnetic spectrum;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) ensure that, in the scheduling of any competitive bidding under this subsection, an adequate period is allowed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) before issuance of bidding rules, to permit notice and comment on proposed auction procedures; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) after issuance of bidding rules, to ensure that interested parties have a sufficient time to develop business plans, assess market conditions, and evaluate the availability of equipment for the relevant services; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) for any auction of eligible frequencies described in section 113(g)(2) of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923(g)(2)), the recovery of 110 percent of estimated relocation costs as provided to the Commission pursuant to section 113(g)(4) of such Act.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Contents of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In prescribing regulations pursuant to paragraph (3), the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) consider alternative payment schedules and methods of calculation, including lump sums or guaranteed installment payments, with or without royalty payments, or other schedules or methods that promote the objectives described in paragraph (3)(B), and combinations of such schedules and methods;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) include performance requirements, such as appropriate deadlines and penalties for performance failures, to ensure prompt delivery of service to rural areas, to prevent stockpiling or warehousing of spectrum by licensees or permittees, and to promote investment in and rapid deployment of new technologies and services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, the purposes of this chapter, and the characteristics of the proposed service, prescribe area designations and bandwidth assignments that promote (i) an equitable distribution of licenses and services among geographic areas, (ii) economic opportunity for a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women, and (iii) investment in and rapid deployment of new technologies and services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services, and, for such purposes, consider the use of tax certificates, bidding preferences, and other procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) require such transfer disclosures and antitrafficking restrictions and payment schedules as may be necessary to prevent unjust enrichment as a result of the methods employed to issue licenses and permits; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) prescribe methods by which a reasonable reserve price will be required, or a minimum bid will be established, to obtain any license or permit being assigned pursuant to the competitive bidding, unless the Commission determines that such a reserve price or minimum bid is not in the public interest.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:126 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Bidder and licensee qualification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No person shall be permitted to participate in a system of competitive bidding pursuant to this subsection unless such bidder submits such information and assurances as the Commission may require to demonstrate that such bidder's application is acceptable for filing. No license shall be granted to an applicant selected pursuant to this subsection unless the Commission determines that the applicant is qualified pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and sections 308(b) and 310 of this title. Consistent with the objectives described in paragraph (3), the Commission shall, by regulation, prescribe expedited procedures consistent with the procedures authorized by subsection (i)(2) of this section for the resolution of any substantial and material issues of fact concerning qualifications.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Rules of construction</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) limit or otherwise affect the requirements of subsection (h) of this section, section 301, 304, 307, 310, or 606 of this title, or any other provision of this chapter (other than subsections (d)(2) and (e) of this section);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) diminish the authority of the Commission under the other provisions of this chapter to regulate or reclaim spectrum licenses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) be construed to convey any rights, including any expectation of renewal of a license, that differ from the rights that apply to other licenses within the same service that were not issued pursuant to this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) be construed to relieve the Commission of the obligation in the public interest to continue to use engineering solutions, negotiation, threshold qualifications, service regulations, and other means in order to avoid mutual exclusivity in application and licensing proceedings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) be construed to prohibit the Commission from issuing nationwide, regional, or local licenses or permits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) be construed to prevent the Commission from awarding licenses to those persons who make significant contributions to the development of a new telecommunications service or technology; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) be construed to relieve any applicant for a license or permit of the obligation to pay charges imposed pursuant to section 158 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Consideration of revenues in public interest determinations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Consideration prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making a decision pursuant to section 303(c) of this title to assign a band of frequencies to a use for which licenses or permits will be issued pursuant to this subsection, and in prescribing regulations pursuant to paragraph (4)(C) of this subsection, the Commission may not base a finding of public interest, convenience, and necessity on the expectation of Federal revenues from the use of a system of competitive bidding under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Consideration limited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In prescribing regulations pursuant to paragraph (4)(A) of this subsection, the Commission may not base a finding of public interest, convenience, and necessity solely or predominantly on the expectation of Federal revenues from the use of a system of competitive bidding under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Consideration of demand for spectrum not affected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Commission from continuing to consider consumer demand for spectrum-based services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Treatment of revenues</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraphs (B), (D), and (E), all proceeds from the use of a competitive bidding system under this subsection shall be deposited in the Treasury in accordance with chapter 33 of title 31.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Retention of revenues</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the salaries and expenses account of the Commission shall retain as an offsetting collection such sums as may be necessary from such proceeds for the costs of developing and implementing the program required by this subsection. Such offsetting collections shall be available for obligation subject to the terms and conditions of the receiving appropriations account, and shall be deposited in such accounts on a quarterly basis. Such offsetting collections are authorized to remain available until expended. No sums may be retained under this subparagraph during any fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1998, if the annual report of the Commission under section 154(k) of this title for the second preceding fiscal year fails to include in the itemized statement required by paragraph (3) of such section a statement of each expenditure made for purposes of conducting competitive bidding under this subsection during such second preceding fiscal year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the deposits of unsuccessful bidders shall be returned to such bidders; and</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;195, &sect;2, June 19, 2002, 116 Stat. 715, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Circumstances in the telecommunications market have changed dramatically since the auctioning of spectrum in the 700 megahertz band was originally mandated by Congress in 1997, raising serious questions as to whether the original deadlines, or the subsequent revision of the deadlines, are consistent with sound telecommunications policy and spectrum management principles.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) No comprehensive plan yet exists for allocating additional spectrum for third-generation wireless and other advanced communications services. The Federal Communications Commission should have the flexibility to auction frequencies in the 700 megahertz band for such purposes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The study being conducted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration in consultation with the Department of Defense to determine whether the Department of Defense can share or relinquish additional spectrum for third generation wireless and other advanced communications services will not be completed until after the June 19th auction date for the upper 700 megahertz band, and long after the applications must be filed to participate in the auction, thereby creating further uncertainty as to whether the frequencies in the 700 megahertz band will be put to their highest and best use for the benefit of consumers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The Federal Communications Commission is also in the process of determining how to resolve the interference problems that exist in the 800 megahertz band, especially for public safety. One option being considered for the 800 megahertz band would involve the 700 megahertz band. The Commission should not hold the 700 megahertz auction before the 800 megahertz interference issues are resolved or a tenable plan has been conceived.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The 700 megahertz band is currently occupied by television broadcasters, and will be so until the transfer to digital television is completed. This situation creates a tremendous amount of uncertainty concerning when the spectrum will be available and reduces the value placed on the spectrum by potential bidders. The encumbrance of the 700 megahertz band reduces both the amount of money that the auction would be likely to produce and the probability that the spectrum would be purchased by the entities that valued the spectrum the most and would put the spectrum to its most productive use.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The Commission's rules governing voluntary mechanisms for vacating the 700 megahertz band by broadcast stations&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) produced no certainty that the band would be available for advanced mobile communications services, public safety operations, or other wireless services any earlier than the existing statutory framework provides; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) should advance the transition of digital television and must not result in the unjust enrichment of any incumbent licensee.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Compliance With Auction Authority</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;195, &sect;4, June 19, 2002, 116 Stat. 717, provided that: &ldquo;The Federal Communications Commission shall conduct rescheduled auctions 31 and 44 prior to the expiration of the auction authority under section 309(j)(11) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)(11)).&rdquo;</p>
