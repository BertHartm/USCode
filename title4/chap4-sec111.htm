<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;received after December 31, 1938,&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete. The words &ldquo;pay or&rdquo; are added before &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; for clarity as the word &ldquo;pay&rdquo; is used throughout title 5, United States Code, to refer to the remuneration, salary, wages, or compensation for the personal services of a Federal employee. The word &ldquo;territory&rdquo; is not capitalized as there are no longer any &ldquo;Territories.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;to tax such compensation&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
