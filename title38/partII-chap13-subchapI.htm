<p class="statutory-body">(a) With respect to a veteran who died in the active military, naval, or air service, such veteran's pay grade shall be determined as of the date of such veteran's death or as of the date of a promotion after death while in a missing status.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) With respect to a veteran who did not die in the active military, naval, or air service, such veteran's pay grade shall be determined as of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the time of such veteran's discharge or release from any period of active duty for training or inactive duty training, if such veteran's death results from service-connected disability incurred during such period and if such veteran was not thereafter discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable from active duty.</p>

The determination as to whether an individual has served satisfactorily for the required period in a higher pay grade shall be made by the Secretary of the department in which such higher pay grade was held.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The pay grade of any person not otherwise described in this section, but who had a compensable status on the date of such person's death under laws administered by the Secretary, shall be determined by the head of the department under which such person performed the services by which such person obtained such status (taking into consideration such person's duties and responsibilities) and certified to the Secretary.
