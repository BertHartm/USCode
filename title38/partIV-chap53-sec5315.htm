<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for an indebtedness resulting from the provision of care or services under chapter 17 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to the extent not precluded by the terms of the loan instruments concerned, for an indebtedness resulting from a person's participation in a program of loans, loan guaranties, or loan insurance administered by the Secretary under this title.</p>
