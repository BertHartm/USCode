<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7292. Review by United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) After a decision of the United States Court of Veterans Appeals is entered in a case, any party to the case may obtain a review of the decision with respect to the validity of any statute or regulation (other than a refusal to review the schedule of ratings for disabilities adopted under section 1155 of this title) or any interpretation thereof (other than a determination as to a factual matter) that was relied on by the Court in making the decision. Such a review shall be obtained by filing a notice of appeal with the Court of Veterans Appeals within the time and in the manner prescribed for appeal to United States courts of appeals from United States district courts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) When a judge or panel of the Court of Veterans Appeals, in making an order not otherwise appealable under this section, determines that a controlling question of law is involved with respect to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion and that there is in fact a disagreement between the appellant and the Secretary with respect to that question of law and that the ultimate termination of the case may be materially advanced by the immediate consideration of that question, the judge or panel shall notify the chief judge of that determination. Upon receiving such a notification, the chief judge shall certify that such a question is presented, and any party to the case may then petition the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to decide the question. That court may permit an interlocutory appeal to be taken on <!-- PDFPage:568 -->that question if such a petition is filed with it within 10 days after the certification by the chief judge of the Court of Veterans Appeals. Neither the application for, nor the granting of, an appeal under this paragraph shall stay proceedings in the Court of Veterans Appeals, unless a stay is ordered by a judge of the Court of Veterans Appeals or by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of subsections (d) and (e) of this section, an order described in this paragraph shall be treated as a decision of the Court of Veterans Appeals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction to review and decide any challenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof brought under this section, and to interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, to the extent presented and necessary to a decision. The judgment of such court shall be final subject to review by the Supreme Court upon certiorari, in the manner provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall decide all relevant questions of law, including interpreting constitutional and statutory provisions. The court shall hold unlawful and set aside any regulation or any interpretation thereof (other than a determination as to a factual matter) that was relied upon in the decision of the Court of Veterans Appeals that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit finds to be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or in violation of a statutory right; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) without observance of procedure required by law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except to the extent that an appeal under this chapter presents a constitutional issue, the Court of Appeals may not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Upon such review, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall have power to affirm or, if the decision of the Court of Veterans Appeals is not in accordance with law, to modify or reverse the decision of the Court of Veterans Appeals or to remand the matter, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Rules for review of decisions of the Court of Veterans Appeals shall be those prescribed by the Supreme Court under section 2072 of title 28.</p>
