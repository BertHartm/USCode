<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) In the event of default in the payment of any loan guaranteed under this chapter, the holder of the obligation shall notify the Secretary of such default. Upon receipt of such notice, the Secretary may, subject to subsection (c) of this section, pay to such holder the guaranty not in excess of the pro rata portion of the amount originally guaranteed. Except as provided in section 3703(e) of this title, if the Secretary makes such a payment, the Secretary shall be subrogated to the rights of the holder of the obligation to the extent of the amount paid on the guaranty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before suit or foreclosure the holder of the obligation shall notify the Secretary of the default, and within thirty days thereafter the Secretary may, at the Secretary's option, pay the holder of the obligation the unpaid balance of the obligation plus accrued interest and receive an assignment of the loan and security. Nothing in this section shall preclude any forebearance for the benefit of the veteran as may be agreed upon by the parties to the loan and approved by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may establish the date, not later than the date of judgment and decree of foreclosure or sale, upon which accrual of interest or charges shall cease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Upon receiving a notice pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) provide the veteran with information and, to the extent feasible, counseling regarding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) alternatives to foreclosure, as appropriate in light of the veteran's particular circumstances, including possible methods of curing the default, conveyance of the property to the Secretary by means of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, and the actions authorized by paragraph (2) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) what the Department of Veterans Affairs&rsquo; and the veteran's liabilities would be with respect to the loan in the event of foreclosure; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) advise the veteran regarding the availability of such counseling;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except with respect to loans made by a lender which the Secretary has determined has a demonstrated record of consistently providing timely and accurate information to veterans with respect to such matters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall, to the extent of the availability of appropriations, ensure that sufficient personnel are available to administer subparagraph (A) of this paragraph effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the event of default in the payment of any loan guaranteed or insured under this chapter in which a partial payment has been tendered by the veteran concerned and refused by the holder, the holder of the obligation shall notify the Secretary as soon as such payment has been refused. The Secretary may require that any such notification include a statement of the circumstances of the default, the amount tendered, the amount of the indebtedness on the date of the tender, and the reasons for the holder's refusal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) With respect to any loan made under section 3711 which has not been sold as provided in subsection (g) of such section, if the Secretary finds, after there has been a default in the payment of any installment of principal or interest owing on such loan, that the default was due to the fact that the veteran who is obligated under the loan has become unemployed as the result of the closing (in whole or in part) of a Federal installation, the Secretary shall (1) extend the time for curing the default to such time as the Secretary determines is necessary and desirable to enable such veteran to complete payments on such loan, including an extension of time beyond the stated maturity thereof, or (2) modify the terms of such loan for the purpose of changing the amortization provisions thereof by recasting, over the remaining term of the loan, or over such longer period as the Secretary may determine, the total unpaid amount then due with the modification to become effective currently or upon the termination of an agreed-upon extension of the period for curing the default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;defaulted loan&rdquo; means a loan that is guaranteed under this chapter, that was made for a purpose described in section 3710(a) of this title, and that is in default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &ldquo;liquidation sale&rdquo; means a judicial sale or other disposition of real property to liquidate a defaulted loan that is secured by such property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The term &ldquo;net value&rdquo;, with respect to real property, means the amount equal to (i) the fair market value of the property, minus (ii) the total of the amounts which the Secretary estimates the Secretary would incur (if the Secretary were to acquire and dispose of the property) for property taxes, assessments, liens, property maintenance, property improvement, administration, resale (including losses sustained on the resale of the property), and other costs resulting from the acquisition and disposition of the property, excluding any amount attributed to the cost to the Government of borrowing funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Except as provided in subparagraph (D) of paragraph (10) of this subsection, the term &ldquo;total indebtedness&rdquo;, with respect to a defaulted loan, means the amount equal to the total of (i) the unpaid principal of the loan, (ii) the interest on the loan as of the date applicable under paragraph (10) of this subsection, and (iii) such reasonably necessary and proper charges (as specified in the loan instrument and permitted by regulations prescribed by the Secretary to implement this subsection) associated with liquidation of the loan, including advances for taxes, insurance, and maintenance or repair of the real property securing the loan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, this subsection applies to any case in which the holder of a defaulted loan undertakes to liquidate the loan by means of a liquidation sale.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Before carrying out a liquidation sale of real property securing a defaulted loan, the holder of the loan shall notify the Secretary of the proposed sale. Such notice shall be provided in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary to implement this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) After receiving a notice described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall determine the net value of the property securing the loan and the amount of the total indebtedness under the loan and shall notify the holder of the loan of the determination of such net value.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A case referred to in paragraphs (5), (6), and (7) of this subsection as being described in this paragraph is a case in which the net value of the property securing a defaulted loan exceeds the amount of the total indebtedness under the loan minus the amount guaranteed under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In a case described in paragraph (4) of this subsection, if the holder of the defaulted loan acquires the property securing the loan at a liquidation sale for an amount that does not exceed the lesser of the net value of the property or the total indebtedness under the loan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the holder shall have the option to convey the property to the United States in return for payment by the Secretary of an amount equal to the lesser of such net value or total indebtedness; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7) In a case described in paragraph (4) of this subsection, if the holder of the defaulted loan acquires the property securing the loan at the liquidation sale for an amount that exceeds the lesser of the total indebtedness under the loan or the net value and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) the amount was the minimum amount for which, under applicable State law, the property was permitted to be sold at the liquidation sale, the holder shall have the option to convey the property to the United States in return for payment by the Secretary of an amount equal to the lesser of the amount for which the holder acquired the property or the total indebtedness under the loan; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) there was no minimum amount for which the property had to be sold at the liquidation sale under applicable State law, the holder shall have the option to convey the property to the United States in return for payment by the Secretary of an amount equal to the lesser of such net value or total indebtedness; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the liability of the United States under the loan guaranty under this chapter is as provided in paragraph (6) of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(8) If the net value of the property securing a defaulted loan is not greater than the amount of the total indebtedness under the loan minus the amount guaranteed under this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary may not accept conveyance of the property from the holder of the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the liability of the United States under the loan guaranty shall be limited to the amount of the total indebtedness under the loan minus the amount realized by the holder of the loan incident to the sale at a liquidation sale of the property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(9) In no event may the liability of the United States under a guaranteed loan exceed the amount guaranteed with respect to that loan under section 3703(b) of this title.

<p class="statutory-body">(10)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph, the date referred to in paragraph (1)(D)(ii) of this subsection shall be the date of the liquidation sale of the property securing the loan (or such earlier date following the expiration of a reasonable period of time for such sale to occur as the Secretary may specify pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary to implement this subsection).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Subject to division (ii) of this subparagraph, in any case in which there is a substantial delay in such sale caused by the holder of the loan exercising forebearance at the request of the Secretary, the date referred to in paragraph (1)(D)(ii) of this subsection shall be such date, on or after the date on which forebearance was requested and prior to the date of such sale, as the Secretary specifies pursuant to regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe to implement this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary may specify a date under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph only if, based on the use of a date so specified for the purposes of such paragraph (1)(D)(ii), the Secretary is authorized, under paragraph (5)(A) or (7)(A) of this subsection, to accept conveyance of the property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In any case in which there is an excessive delay in such liquidation sale caused&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) by a voluntary case commenced under title 11, United States Code (relating to bankruptcy);</p>
