<p class="statutory-body">(a) In any action brought under this chapter, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, to the extent necessary to its decision and when presented, shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) compel action of the Secretary unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) hold unlawful and set aside decisions, findings (other than those described in clause (4) of this subsection), conclusions, rules, and regulations issued or adopted by the Secretary, the Board of Veterans&rsquo; Appeals, or the Chairman of the Board found to be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or in violation of a statutory right; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) without observance of procedure required by law; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in the case of a finding of material fact adverse to the claimant made in reaching a decision in a case before the Department with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary, hold unlawful and set aside or reverse such finding if the finding is clearly erroneous.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In making the determinations under subsection (a), the Court shall review the record of proceedings before the Secretary and the Board of Veterans&rsquo; Appeals pursuant to section 7252(b) of this title and shall&mdash;</p>
