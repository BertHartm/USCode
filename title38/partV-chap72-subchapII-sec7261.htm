<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) hold unlawful and set aside decisions, findings (other than those described in clause (4) of this subsection), conclusions, rules, and regulations issued or adopted by the Secretary, the Board of Veterans&rsquo; Appeals, or the Chairman of the Board found to be&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or in violation of a statutory right; or</p>
