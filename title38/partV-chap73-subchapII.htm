<p class="statutory-body-block">for damages for personal injury, including death, allegedly arising from malpractice or negligence of a medical care employee of the Administration in furnishing medical care or treatment while in the exercise of that employee's duties in or for the Administration shall be exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding by reason of the same subject matter against the medical care employee (or employee's estate) whose act or omission gave rise to such claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;medical care employee of the Administration&rdquo; means a physician, dentist, podiatrist, optometrist, nurse, physician assistant, expanded-function dental auxiliary, pharmacist, or paramedical (such as medical and dental technicians, nursing assistants, and therapists), or other supporting personnel.</p>

After removal the United States shall have available all defenses to which it would have been entitled if the action had originally been commenced against the United States. Should a United States district court determine on a hearing on a motion to remand held before a trial on the merits that the employee whose act or omission gave rise to the suit was not acting within the scope of such person's office or employment, the case shall be remanded to the State court.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Indemnity under paragraph (1) is indemnity against either or both of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Liability (including reasonable expenses of litigation or settlement) to third persons, except liability under State or Federal workers&rsquo; injury compensation laws to employees of the contractor employed at the site of and in connection with the contract for which indemnification is granted, for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property, from a risk that the contract defines as unusually hazardous.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Loss of or damage to property of the contractor from a risk that the contract defines as unusually hazardous.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A contract that provides for indemnification in accordance with subsection (a) must also provide for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) notice to the United States of any claim or suit against the contractor for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) control of or assistance in the defense by the United States, at its election, of any such suit or claim for which indemnification is provided hereunder.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) funds obligated for the performance of the contract concerned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) funds available for research or development or both, and not otherwise obligated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) funds appropriated for those payments.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Each contractor which is a party to an indemnification agreement under subsection (a) shall have and maintain financial protection of such type and in such amounts as the Secretary shall require to cover liability to third persons and loss of or damage to the contractor's property. The amount of financial protection required shall be the maximum amount of insurance available from private sources, except that the Secretary may establish a lesser amount, taking into consideration the cost and terms of private insurance. Such financial protection may include private insurance, private contractual indemnities, self-insurance, other proof of financial responsibility, or a combination of such measures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) In administering the provisions of this section, the Secretary may use the facilities and services of private insurance organizations and may contract to pay a reasonable compensation therefor. Any contract made under the provisions of this section may be made without regard to the provisions of section 3709 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5), upon a showing by the Secretary that advertising is not reasonably practicable, and advance payments may be made under any such contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The authority to indemnify contractors under this section does not create any rights in third persons which would not otherwise exist by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Funds appropriated to carry out this section shall remain available until expended.</p>
