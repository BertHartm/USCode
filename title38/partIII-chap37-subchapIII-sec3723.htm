<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) For the purposes of section 3711 of this title, the revolving fund heretofore established by section 513 of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 is continued in effect. For the purposes of further augmenting the revolving fund, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to advance to the Secretary from time to time after December 31, 1958, and until June 30, 1961, such sums (not in excess of $150,000,000 in any one fiscal year, including prior advancements in fiscal year 1959) as the Secretary may request, except that the aggregate so advanced in any one quarter annual period shall not exceed the sum of $50,000,000, less that amount which has been returned to the revolving fund during the preceding quarter annual period from the sale of loans pursuant to section 3711(g) of this title. In addition to the sums authorized in this subsection the Secretary of the Treasury shall also advance to the Secretary such additional sums, not in excess of $100,000,000, as the Secretary may request, and the sums so advanced shall be made available without regard to any limitation contained in this subsection with respect to the amount which may be advanced in any one quarter annual period. The Secretary of the Treasury shall also advance to the Secretary from time to time such additional sums as the Secretary may request, not in ex<!-- PDFPage:449 -->cess of $100,000,000 to be immediately available, plus an additional amount not in excess of $400,000,000 after June 30, 1961, plus $200,000,000 after June 30, 1962, plus $150,000,000 after June 30, 1963, plus $150,000,000 after June 30, 1964, plus $100,000,000 after June 30, 1965, plus $100,000,000 after June 30, 1966. Any such authorized advance which is not requested by the Secretary in the fiscal year in which the advance may be made shall be made thereafter when requested by the Secretary, except that no such request or advance may be made after June 30, 1967. Such authorized advances are not subject to the quarter annual limitation in the second sentence of this subsection, but the amount authorized to be advanced in any fiscal year after June 30, 1962, shall be reduced only by the amount which has been returned to the revolving fund during the preceding fiscal year from the sale of loans pursuant to section 3711(g) of this title. In addition the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to make available to the Secretary for this purpose from time to time as the Secretary may request the amount of any funds which may have been deposited to the credit of miscellaneous receipts under this subsection or subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) On advances to such revolving fund by the Secretary of the Treasury, less those amounts deposited in miscellaneous receipts under subsections (a) and (c) the Secretary shall pay semiannually to the Treasurer of the United States interest at the rate or rates determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average rate on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States as of the last day of the month preceding the advance. The Secretary shall not be required to pay interest on transfers made pursuant to the Act of February 13, 1962 (76 Stat. 8), from the capital of the &ldquo;direct loans to veterans and reserves revolving fund&rdquo; to the &ldquo;loan guaranty revolving fund&rdquo; and adjustments shall be made for payments of interest on such transfers before February 29, 1964.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In order to make advances to such revolving fund, as authorized by law to effectuate the purposes and functions authorized in section 3711 of this title, the Secretary of the Treasury may use, as a public debt transaction, the proceeds of the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 include such purposes. Such sums, together with all receipts under this section and section 3711 of this title, shall be deposited with the Treasurer of the United States, in a special deposit account, and shall be available, respectively, for disbursement for the purposes of section 3711 of this title. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall from time to time cause to be deposited into the Treasury of the United States, to the credit of miscellaneous receipts, such of the funds in such account as in the Secretary's judgment are not needed for the purposes for which they were provided, including the proceeds of the sale of any loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer from the direct loan revolving fund to the loan guaranty revolving fund established by section 3724(a) of this title such amounts as the Secretary determines are not needed in the direct loan revolving fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 30 days after the date on which the Secretary of the Treasury makes a transfer under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall submit a notice of such transfer to the appropriate committees of the Congress.</p>
