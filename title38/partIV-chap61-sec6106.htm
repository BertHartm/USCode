<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Fee Forfeiture in Case of Benefit Misuse by Fiduciaries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A fiduciary may not collect a fee from a beneficiary for any month with respect to which the Secretary or a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that the fiduciary misused all or part of the individual's benefit, and any amount so collected by the fiduciary as a fee for such month shall be treated as a misused part of the individual's benefit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Misuse of Benefits Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this chapter, misuse of benefits by a fiduciary occurs in any case in which the fiduciary receives payment, under any of laws administered by the Secretary, for the use and benefit of a beneficiary and uses such payment, or any part thereof, for a use other than for the use and benefit of such beneficiary or that beneficiary's dependents. Retention by a fiduciary of an amount of a benefit payment as a fiduciary fee or commission, or as attorney's fees (including expenses) and court costs, if authorized by the Secretary or a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be considered to be for the use or benefit of such beneficiary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may prescribe by regulation the meaning of the term &ldquo;use and benefit&rdquo; for purposes of this section.</p>
