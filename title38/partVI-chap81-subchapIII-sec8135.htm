<p class="statutory-body">(B) A grant may not be increased under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph by more than 10 percent of the amount of the grant initially awarded for such project, and the amount of such grant, as increased, may not exceed 65 percent of the cost of the project.</p>

Such amount shall be paid, in advance or by way of reimbursement, and in such installments consistent with the progress of the project as the Secretary may determine and certify for payment to the Secretary of the Treasury. Funds paid under this section for an approved project shall be used solely for carrying out such project as so approved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Any amendment of any application, whether or not approved, shall be subject to approval in the same manner as an original application.</p>
