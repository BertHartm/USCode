<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 110&ndash;389, title VII, &sect;701, Oct. 10, 2008, 122 Stat. 4180, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) In 1998, Congress enacted the Olympic and Amateur Sports Act Amendments of 1998 (33 [36] U.S.C. 101 note) [see Short Title of 1998 Amendment note set out under section 101 of Title 36, Patriotic and National Observances, Ceremonies, and Organizations], which amended chapter 2205 of title 36, United States Code, and included a statement that the purpose of the Act was &lsquo;to encourage and provide assistance to amateur athletic programs and competition for amateur athletes with disabilities, including, where feasible, the expansion of opportunities for meaningful participation by such amateur athletes in programs of athletic competition for able-bodied amateur athletes&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The United States Olympic Committee manages and administers the Paralympic Program for physically disabled athletes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Department of Veterans Affairs provides health care to veterans and administers recreational activities for patients including the Golden Age Games, the National Veterans Wheelchair Games, and the Winter Sports Clinic.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) In 2005, the United States Olympic Committee entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to increase interest in and access to Paralympic sports programs for veterans with physical disabilities by coordinating the activities of the United States Olympic Committee with the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The Paralympic Program has a significant positive effect on the quality of life of disabled veterans and disabled members of the Armed Forces who participate in the program, including helping to improve the mobility, vitality, and physical, psychological, and social well-being of such participants and reducing the incidence of secondary medical conditions in those participants.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Because of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, the number of disabled veterans and disabled members of the Armed Forces has increased substantially and it is therefore desirable to supplement the rehabilitation and recreation programs of the Department of Veterans Affairs through sports for disabled veterans and members of the Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this title [enacting this section, section 521A of this title, and provisions set out as notes under section 521A of this title] are as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) To promote the lifelong health of disabled veterans and disabled members of the Armed Forces through regular participation in physical activity and sports.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) To enhance the recreation activities provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs by promoting disabled sports from the local level through elite levels and by creating partnerships among organizations specializing in supporting, training, and promoting programs for disabled veterans.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) To provide training and support to national and local organizations to provide Paralympic sports training to disabled veterans and disabled members of the Armed Forces in their own communities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) To provide support to the United States Paralympics, Inc., to increase the participation of disabled veterans and disabled members of the Armed Forces in sports.&rdquo;</p>
