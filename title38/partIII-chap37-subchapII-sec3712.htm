<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) To purchase a single-wide manufactured home.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) To purchase a single-wide manufactured home and a lot on which to place such home.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) To purchase a double-wide manufactured home.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) To refinance in accordance with paragraph (5) of this subsection an existing loan that was made for the purchase of, and that is secured by, a manufactured home and to purchase a lot on which such manufactured home is or will be placed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A loan for any of the purposes described in paragraph (1) of this subsection (other than the refinancing under clause (F) of such paragraph of an existing loan) may include an amount determined by the Secretary to be appropriate to cover the cost of necessary preparation of a lot already owned or to be acquired by the veteran, including the costs of installing utility connections and sanitary facilities, of paving, and of constructing a suitable pad for the manufactured home.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any loan made for the purposes described in clause (C), (E), or (G) of paragraph (1) of this <!-- PDFPage:577 -->subsection shall be considered as part of one loan. The transaction may be evidenced by a single loan instrument or by separate loan instruments for (A) that portion of the loan which finances the purchase of the manufactured home, and (B) that portion of the loan which finances the purchase of the lot and the necessary preparation of such lot.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) For a loan to be guaranteed for the purpose specified in clause (F) of paragraph (1) of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the interest rate of the loan must be less than the interest rate of the loan being refinanced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the loan must be secured by the same manufactured home or manufactured-home lot, or manufactured home and manufactured-home lot, as was the loan being refinanced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the amount of the loan may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the balance of the loan being refinanced and such closing costs (including any discount permitted pursuant to section 3703(c)(3)(A) of this title) as may be authorized by the Secretary, under regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, to be included in such loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) notwithstanding section 3703(a)(1) of this title, the amount of the guaranty of the loan may not exceed the greater of (I) the original guaranty amount of the loan being refinanced, or (II) 25 percent of the loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) the term of the loan may not exceed the original term of the loan being refinanced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) the veteran must own the manufactured home, or the manufactured-home lot, or the manufactured home and the manufactured-home lot, securing the loan and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) must occupy the home, a manufactured home on the lot, or the home and the lot, securing the loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) must have previously occupied the home, a manufactured home on the lot, or the home and the lot, securing the loan as the veteran's home and must certify, in such form as the Secretary shall require, that the veteran has previously so occupied the home (or such a home on the lot); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) in any case in which a veteran is in active duty status as a member of the Armed Forces and is unable to occupy the home, a manufactured home on the lot, or the home and the lot, as a home because of such status, the spouse of the veteran must occupy, or must have previously occupied, the manufactured home on the lot, or the home and the lot, as such spouse's home and must certify such occupancy in such form as the Secretary shall require.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A loan to a veteran may be guaranteed by the Secretary under this chapter for the purpose specified in clause (F) of paragraph (1) of this subsection without regard to the amount of outstanding guaranty entitlement available for use by such veteran, and the amount of such veteran's guaranty entitlement shall not be charged as a result of any guaranty provided for such purpose. For purposes of section 3702(b) of this title, such loan shall be deemed to have been obtained with the guaranty entitlement used to obtain the loan being refinanced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If a veteran is deceased and if such veteran's surviving spouse was a co-obligor under an existing loan previously guaranteed, insured, or made for purposes specified in this section, such surviving spouse shall, only for the purpose specified in clause (F) of paragraph (1) of this subsection, be deemed to be a veteran eligible for benefits under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) For a loan to be guaranteed for the purpose specified in paragraph (1)(G) of this subsection or section 3710(a)(9)(B)(ii) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the loan must be secured by the same manufactured home as was the loan being refinanced and such manufactured home must be owned and occupied by the veteran (except as provided in section 3704(c)(2) of this title) as such veteran's home; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount of the loan may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the purchase price of the lot,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the amount (if any) determined by the Secretary to be appropriate under paragraph (2) of this subsection to cover the cost of necessary preparation of such lot,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) the balance of the loan being refinanced, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(IV) such closing costs (including any discount permitted pursuant to section 3703(c)(3)(E) of this title) as may be authorized by the Secretary, under regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, to be included in such loan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) When a loan is made to a veteran for the purpose specified in paragraph (1)(G) of this subsection or section 3710(a)(9)(B)(ii) of this title, and the loan being refinanced was guaranteed, insured, or made under this section, the portion of the loan made for the purpose of refinancing such loan may be guaranteed by the Secretary under this chapter without regard to the amount of outstanding guaranty entitlement available for use by such veteran, and the amount of such veteran's guaranty entitlement shall not be charged as a result of any guaranty provided for such portion of such loan. For the purposes of section 3702(b) of this title, such portion of such loan shall be deemed to have been obtained with the guaranty entitlement used to obtain the loan being refinanced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Use of entitlement for purposes specified in this section for the purchase of a manufactured home unit shall preclude the use of remaining entitlement for the purchase of an additional manufactured home unit until the unit which secured the loan has been disposed of by the veteran or has been destroyed by fire or other natural hazard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall restore entitlement to all housing loan benefits under this chapter for the veteran when the conditions prescribed in section 3702(b) of this title have been met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Loans for any of the purposes authorized by subsection (a) of this section shall be submitted to the Secretary for approval prior to the closing of the loan, except that the Secretary may exempt any lender of a class listed in section 3702(d) of this title from compliance with such prior approval requirement if the Secretary determines that the experience of such lender or class of lenders in manufactured home financing warrants such exemption.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon determining that a loan submitted for prior approval is eligible for guaranty for <!-- PDFPage:578 -->purposes specified in this section, the Secretary shall issue a commitment to guarantee such loan and shall thereafter guarantee the loan when made if such loan qualifies therefor in all respects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary's guaranty may not exceed the lesser of (i) the lesser of $20,000 or 40 percent of the loan, or (ii) the maximum amount of the guaranty entitlement available to the veteran as specified in paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A claim under the Secretary's guaranty shall, at the election of the holder of a loan, be made by the filing of an accounting with the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) within a reasonable time after the receipt by such holder of an appraisal by the Secretary of the value of the security for the loan; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) after liquidation of the security for the loan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the holder of a loan applies for payment of a claim under clause (i) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the amount of such claim payable by the Secretary shall be the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the amount equal to the excess, if any, of the total indebtedness over the amount of the appraisal referred to in such clause; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount equal to the guaranty under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If the holder of a loan files for payment of a claim under clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the amount of such claim payable by the Secretary shall be the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the amount equal to the excess, if any, of the total indebtedness over the greater of the value of the property securing the loan, as determined by the Secretary, or the amount of the liquidation or resale proceeds; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount equal to the guaranty under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(E) In any accounting filed pursuant to subparagraph (B)(ii) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall permit to be included therein accrued unpaid interest from the date of the first uncured default to such cutoff date as the Secretary may establish, and the Secretary shall allow the holder of the loan to charge against the liquidation or resale proceeds accrued interest from the cutoff date established to such further date as the Secretary may determine and such costs and expenses as the Secretary determines to be reasonable and proper.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) The liability of the United States under the guaranty provided for by this paragraph shall decrease or increase pro rata with any decrease or increase of the amount of the unpaid portion of the obligation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The maximum amount of guaranty entitlement available to a veteran for purposes specified in this section shall be $20,000 reduced by the amount of any such entitlement previously used by the veteran. Use of entitlement for purposes specified in section 3710 or 3711 of this title shall reduce entitlement available for use for purposes specified in this section to the same extent that entitlement available for purposes specified in such section 3710 is reduced below $20,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The amount of any loan guaranteed for purposes specified in this section shall not exceed an amount equal to 95 percent of the purchase price of the property securing the loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The maturity of any loan guaranteed for purposes specified in this section shall not be more than&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall preclude the Secretary, under regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, from consenting to necessary advances for the protection of the security or the holder's lien, to a reasonable extension of the term of such loan, or to a reasonable reamortization of such loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) No loan shall be guaranteed for purposes specified in this section unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the loan is repayable in approximately equal monthly installments;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the terms of repayment bear a proper relationship to the veteran's present and anticipated income and expenses, and the veteran is a satisfactory credit risk, as determined in accordance with the regulations prescribed under section 3710(g) of this title and taking into account the purpose of this program to make available lower cost housing to low and lower income veterans, especially those who have been recently discharged or released from active military, naval, or air service, who may not have previously established credit ratings;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) with respect to any portion of the loan to purchase a lot, the reasonable value of such lot, as determined by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) with respect to any portion of the loan to cover the cost of necessary site preparation, an appropriate amount, as determined by the Secretary;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
