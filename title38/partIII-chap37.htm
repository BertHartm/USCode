<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the loan has been repaid in full, or the Secretary has been released from liability as to the loan, or if the Secretary has suffered a loss on such loan, the loss has been paid in full.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A veteran-transferee has agreed to assume the outstanding balance on the loan and consented to the use of the veteran-transferee's entitlement, to the extent that the entitlement of the veteran-transferor had been used originally, in place of the veteran-transferor's for the guaranteed, insured, or direct loan, and the veteran-transferee otherwise meets the requirements of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) The loan has been repaid in full; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the loan for which the veteran seeks to use entitlement under this chapter is secured by the same property which secured the loan referred to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) In a case not covered by paragraph (1) or (2)&mdash;</p>

The authority of the Secretary under this subsection to exclude an amount of guaranty or insurance housing loan entitlement previously used by a veteran may be exercised only once for that veteran under the authority of paragraph (4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) An honorable discharge shall be deemed to be a certificate of eligibility to apply for a guar<!-- PDFPage:426 -->anteed loan. Any veteran who does not have a discharge certificate, or who received a discharge other than honorable, may apply to the Secretary for a certificate of eligibility. Upon making a loan guaranteed or insured under this chapter, the lender shall forthwith transmit to the Secretary a report thereon in such detail as the Secretary may, from time to time, prescribe. Where the loan is guaranteed, the Secretary shall provide the lender with a loan guaranty certificate or other evidence of the guaranty. The Secretary shall also endorse on the veteran's discharge, or eligibility certificate, the amount and type of guaranty used, and the amount, if any, remaining. Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the assignment of any guaranteed loan or the security therefor.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i)(I) in the case of any loan of not more than $45,000, 50 percent of the loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) in the case of any loan of more than $45,000, but not more than $56,250, $22,500;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) except as provided in subclause (IV) of this clause, in the case of any loan of more than $56,250, the lesser of $36,000 or 40 percent of the loan; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) in the case of any loan of more than $144,000 for a purpose specified in clause (1), (2), (3), (6), or (8) of section 3710(a) of this title, the lesser of $50,750 or 25 percent of the loan; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the maximum amount of guaranty entitlement available to the veteran as specified in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The maximum amount of guaranty entitlement available to a veteran for purposes specified in section 3710 of this title shall be $36,000, or in the case of a loan described in subparagraph (A)(i)(IV) of this paragraph, $50,750, reduced by the amount of entitlement previously used by the veteran under this chapter and not restored as a result of the exclusion in section 3702(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Any housing loan which might be guaranteed under the provisions of this chapter, when made or purchased by any financial institution subject to examination and supervision by any agency of the United States or of any State may, in lieu of such guaranty, be insured by the Secretary under an agreement whereby the Secretary will reimburse any such institution for losses incurred on such loan up to 15 per centum of the aggregate of loans so made or purchased by it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Loans insured under this section shall be made on such other terms, conditions, and restrictions as the Secretary may prescribe within the limitations set forth in this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The liability of the United States under any guaranty, within the limitations of this chapter, shall decrease or increase pro rata with any decrease or increase of the amount of the unpaid portion of the obligation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Loans guaranteed or insured under this chapter shall be payable upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the parties thereto, subject to the provisions of this chapter and regulations of the Secretary issued pursuant to this chapter, and shall bear interest not in excess of such rate as the Secretary may from time to time find the loan market demands, except that in establishing the rate of interest that shall be applicable to such loans, the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development regarding the rate of interest applicable to home loans insured under section 203(b) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(b)). In establishing rates of interest under this paragraph for one or more of the purposes described in clauses (4) and (7) of section 3710(a) of this title, the Secretary may establish a rate or rates higher than the rate specified for other purposes under such section, but any such rate may not exceed such rate as the Secretary may from time to time find the loan market demands for loans for such purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 which were in effect before April 1, 1958, with respect to the interest chargeable on loans made or guaranteed under such Act shall, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, continue to be applicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to any loan made or guaranteed before April 1, 1958; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to any loan with respect to which a commitment to guarantee was entered into by the Secretary before April 1, 1958.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This section shall not be construed to prohibit a veteran from paying to a lender any reasonable discount required by such lender, when the proceeds from the loan are to be used&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to refinance indebtedness pursuant to clause (5), (8), or (9)(B)(i) of section 3710(a) of this title or section 3712(a)(1)(F) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to repair, alter, or improve a farm residence or other dwelling pursuant to clauses (4) and (7) of section 3710(a) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to construct a dwelling or farm residence on land already owned or to be acquired by the veteran except where the land is directly or indirectly acquired from a builder or developer who has contracted to construct such dwelling for the veteran;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) to purchase a dwelling from a class of sellers which the Secretary determines are legally precluded under all circumstances from paying such a discount if the best interest of the veteran would be so served; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) to refinance indebtedness and purchase a manufactured-home lot pursuant to section 3710(a)(9)(B)(ii) or 3712(a)(1)(G) of this title, but only with respect to that portion of the loan used to refinance such indebtedness.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) In guaranteeing or insuring loans under this chapter, the Secretary may elect whether to require that such loans bear interest at a rate that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) agreed upon by the veteran and the mortgagee; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) established under paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary may, from time to time, change the election under this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any veteran, under a loan described in subparagraph (A)(i), may pay reasonable discount points in connection with the loan. Except in the case of a loan for the purpose specified in section 3710(a)(8), 3710(b)(7), or 3712(a)(1)(F) of this title, discount points may not be financed as part of the principal amount of a loan guaranteed or insured under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Not later than 10 days after an election under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall transmit to the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives a notification of the election, together with an explanation of the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The maturity of any housing loan shall not be more than thirty years and thirty-two days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Any loan for a term of more than five years shall be amortized in accordance with established procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may guarantee loans with provisions for various rates of amortization corresponding to anticipated variations in family <!-- PDFPage:429 -->income. With respect to any loan guaranteed under this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the initial principal amount of the loan may not exceed the reasonable value of the property as of the time the loan is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the principal amount of the loan thereafter (including the amount of all interest to be deferred and added to principal) may not at any time be scheduled to exceed the projected value of the property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For the purposes of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the projected value of the property shall be calculated by the Secretary by increasing the reasonable value of the property as of the time the loan is made at a rate not in excess of 2.5 percent per year, but in no event may the projected value of the property for the purposes of such subparagraph exceed 115 percent of such reasonable value. A loan made for a purpose other than the acquisition of a single-family dwelling unit may not be guaranteed under such subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any real estate housing loan (other than for repairs, alterations, or improvements) shall be secured by a first lien on the realty. In determining whether a loan for the purchase or construction of a home is so secured, the Secretary may disregard a superior lien created by a duly recorded covenant running with the realty in favor of a private entity to secure an obligation to such entity for the homeowner's share of the costs of the management, operation, or maintenance of property, services or programs within and for the benefit of the development or community in which the veteran's realty is located, if the Secretary determines that the interests of the veteran borrower and of the Government will not be prejudiced by the operation of such covenant. In respect to any such superior lien to be created after June 6, 1969, the Secretary's determination must have been made prior to the recordation of the covenant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, an individual who pays a fee under section 3729 of this title, or who is exempted under section 3729(c)(1) of this title from paying such fee, with respect to a housing loan guaranteed or insured under this chapter that is closed after December 31, 1989, shall have no liability to the Secretary with respect to the loan for any loss resulting from any default of such individual except in the case of fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith by such individual in obtaining the loan or in connection with the loan default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The exemption from liability provided by paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an individual from whom a fee is collected (or who is exempted from such fee) under section 3729(b) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a loan made for any purpose specified in section 3712 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The application for or obtaining of a loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this chapter shall not be subject to reporting requirements applicable to requests for, or receipts of, Federal contracts, grants, loans, loan guarantees, loan insurance, or cooperative agreements except to the extent that such requirements are provided for in, or by the Secretary pursuant to, this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) No loan for the purchase or construction of residential property shall be financed through the assistance of this chapter unless the property meets or exceeds minimum requirements for planning, construction, and general acceptability prescribed by the Secretary; however, this subsection shall not apply to a loan for the purchase of residential property on which construction is fully completed more than one year before such loan is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Subject to notice and opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary may refuse to appraise any dwelling or housing project owned, sponsored, or to be constructed by any person identified with housing previously sold to veterans under this chapter as to which substantial deficiencies have been discovered, or as to which there has been a failure or indicated inability to discharge contractual liabilities to veterans, or as to which it is ascertained that the type of contract of sale or the methods or practices pursued in relation to the marketing of such properties were unfair or unduly prejudicial to veteran purchasers. The Secretary may also refuse to appraise any dwelling or housing project owned, sponsored, or to be constructed by any person refused the benefits of participation under the National Housing Act pursuant to a determination of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, no loan for the purchase or construction of residential property shall be financed through the assistance of this chapter unless the veteran applicant, at the time that the veteran applies for the loan, and also at the time that the loan is closed, certifies in such form as the Secretary may require, that the veteran intends to occupy the property as the veteran's home. Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, no loan for the repair, alteration, or improvement of residential property shall be financed through the assistance of the provisions of this chapter unless the veteran applicant, at the time that the veteran applies to the lender for the loan, and also at the time that the loan is closed, certifies, in such form as may be required by the Secretary, that the veteran occupies the property as the veteran's home. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection, in the case of a loan automatically guaranteed under this chapter, the veteran shall be required to make the certification only at the time the loan is closed. For the purposes of this chapter the requirement that the veteran recipient of a guaranteed or direct home loan must occupy or intend to occupy the property as the veteran's home means that the veteran as of the date of the veteran's certification actually lives in the property personally as the veteran's residence or actually intends upon completion of the loan and acquisition of the dwelling unit to move into the property personally within a reasonable time and to utilize such property as the veteran's residence. Notwithstanding the foregoing requirements of this subsection, the provisions for certification by the veteran at the time the veteran applies for the loan and at the time the loan is closed shall be considered to be satisfied if the Secretary finds that (1) in the case of a loan for repair, alteration, or improvement the veteran in fact did occupy the property at such times, or (2) in the case of a loan for construction or purchase the veteran intended to occupy the property as the veteran's home at such times and the veteran did in fact so occupy it when, or within a reasonable time after, the loan was closed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which a veteran is in active duty status as a member of the Armed Forces and is unable to occupy a property because of such status, the occupancy requirements of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) paragraph (1) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) paragraphs (1) through (5) and paragraph (7) of section 3710(a) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) section 3712(a)(5)(A)(i) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) section 3712(e)(5) of this title;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be considered to be satisfied if the spouse of the veteran occupies the property as the spouse's home and the spouse makes the certification required by paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Subject to notice and opportunity for a hearing, whenever the Secretary finds with respect to guaranteed or insured loans that any lender or holder has failed to maintain adequate loan accounting records, or to demonstrate proper ability to service loans adequately or to exercise proper credit judgment or has willfully or negligently engaged in practices otherwise detrimental to the interest of veterans or of the Government, the Secretary may refuse either temporarily or permanently to guarantee or insure any loans made by such lender or holder and may bar such lender or holder from acquiring loans guaranteed or insured under this chapter; however, the Secretary shall not refuse to pay a guaranty or insurance claim on loans theretofore entered into in good faith between a veteran and such lender. The Secretary may also refuse either temporarily or permanently to <!-- PDFPage:433 -->guarantee or insure any loans made by a lender or holder refused the benefits of participation under the National Housing Act pursuant to a determination of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Any housing loan which is financed through the assistance of this chapter and to which section 3714 of this chapter applies shall include a provision that the loan is immediately due and payable upon transfer of the property securing such loan to any transferee unless the acceptability of the assumption of the loan is established pursuant to such section 3714.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) A loan for the purchase or construction of new residential property, the construction of which began after the energy efficiency standards under section 109 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 12709), as amended by section 101(c) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, take effect, may not be financed through the assistance of this chapter unless the new residential property is constructed in compliance with such standards.</p>

The Secretary shall deliver to the builder, seller, or other warrantor the Secretary's written approval (which shall be conclusive evidence of such appraisal) of any amendment of, or change or variation in, such plans and specifications which the Secretary deems to be a substantial amendment thereof, or change or variation therein, and shall file a copy of such written approval with such plans and specifications. Such warranty shall apply only with respect to such instances of substantial nonconformity to such approved plans and specifications (including any amendments thereof, or changes or variations therein, which have been approved in writing, as provided in this section, by the Secretary) as to which the purchaser or home owner has given written notice to the warrantor within one year from the date of conveyance of title to, or initial occupancy of, the dwelling, whichever first occurs. Such warranty shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, all other rights and privileges which such purchaser or owner may have under any other law or instrument.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A loan to a veteran may be guaranteed by the Secretary under this chapter for the purpose specified in clause (8) of subsection (a) of this section without regard to the amount of outstanding guaranty entitlement available for use by such veteran, and the amount of such veteran's guaranty entitlement shall not be charged as a result of any guaranty provided for such purpose.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that housing credit for purposes specified in section 3710 or 3712 of this title is not and has not been generally available to veterans living in rural areas, or in small cities and towns not near large metropolitan areas. It is therefore the purpose of this section to provide housing credit for veterans living in such rural areas and such small cities and towns.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Whenever the Secretary finds that private capital is not generally available in any rural area or small city or town for the financing of loans guaranteed for purposes specified in section 3710 or 3712 of this title, the Secretary shall designate such rural area or small city or town as a &ldquo;housing credit shortage area&rdquo;. The Secretary shall, with respect to any such area, make, or enter into commitments to make, to any veteran eligible under this title, a loan for any or all of the purposes described in section 3710(a) or 3712 of this title (other than the refinancing of a loan under section 3710(a)(8) or 3712(a)(1)(F)).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the veteran is unable to obtain a loan for such purpose from the Secretary of Agriculture under title III of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1921 et seq.) or title V of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Loans made under this section shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary, not to exceed the rate authorized for guaranteed home loans, or manufactured home loans, as appropriate, and shall be subject to such requirements or limitations prescribed for loans guaranteed under this title as may be applicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except for any loan made under this chapter for the purposes described in section 3712 of this title, the original principal amount of any loan made under this section shall not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to $33,000 as the amount of guaranty to which the veteran is entitled under section 3710 of this title at the time the loan is made bears to $36,000; and the guaranty entitlement of any veteran who heretofore or hereafter has been granted a loan under this section shall be charged with an amount which bears the same ratio to $36,000 as the amount of the loan bears to $33,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The original principal amount of any loan made under this section for the purposes described in section 3712 of this title shall not exceed the amount that bears the same ratio to $33,000 as the amount of guaranty to which the veteran is entitled under such section at the time the loan is made bears to $20,000. The amount of the guaranty entitlement for purposes specified in section 3710 of this title of any veteran who is granted a loan under this section, or who before October 18, 1978, was granted a loan under this section, shall be charged with the amount that bears the same ratio to $20,000 as the amount of the loan bears to $33,000.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A loan for any of the purposes described in paragraph (1) of this subsection (other than the refinancing under clause (F) of such paragraph of an existing loan) may include an amount determined by the Secretary to be appropriate to cover the cost of necessary preparation of a lot already owned or to be acquired by the veteran, including the costs of installing utility connections and sanitary facilities, of paving, and of constructing a suitable pad for the manufactured home.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any loan made for the purposes described in clause (C), (E), or (G) of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be considered as part of one loan. The transaction may be evidenced by a single loan instrument or by separate loan instruments for (A) that portion of the loan which finances the purchase of the manufactured home, and (B) that portion of the loan which finances the purchase of the lot and the necessary preparation of such lot.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) For a loan to be guaranteed for the purpose specified in clause (F) of paragraph (1) of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the interest rate of the loan must be less than the interest rate of the loan being refinanced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the loan must be secured by the same manufactured home or manufactured-home lot, or manufactured home and manufactured-home lot, as was the loan being refinanced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the amount of the loan may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the balance of the loan being refinanced and such closing costs (including any discount permitted pursuant to section 3703(c)(3)(A) of this title) as may be authorized by the Secretary, under regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, to be included in such loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) notwithstanding section 3703(a)(1) of this title, the amount of the guaranty of the loan may not exceed the greater of (I) the original guaranty amount of the loan being refinanced, or (II) 25 percent of the loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) the term of the loan may not exceed the original term of the loan being refinanced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) the veteran must own the manufactured home, or the manufactured-home lot, or the manufactured home and the manufactured-home lot, securing the loan and&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) must have previously occupied the home, a manufactured home on the lot, or the home and the lot, securing the loan as the veteran's home and must certify, in such form as the Secretary shall require, that the veteran has previously so occupied the home (or such a home on the lot); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) in any case in which a veteran is in active duty status as a member of the Armed Forces and is unable to occupy the home, a manufactured home on the lot, or the home and the lot, as a home because of such status, the spouse of the veteran must occupy, or must have previously occupied, the manufactured home on the lot, or the home and the lot, as such spouse's home and must certify such occupancy in such form as the Secretary shall require.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A loan to a veteran may be guaranteed by the Secretary under this chapter for the purpose <!-- PDFPage:445 -->specified in clause (F) of paragraph (1) of this subsection without regard to the amount of outstanding guaranty entitlement available for use by such veteran, and the amount of such veteran's guaranty entitlement shall not be charged as a result of any guaranty provided for such purpose. For purposes of section 3702(b) of this title, such loan shall be deemed to have been obtained with the guaranty entitlement used to obtain the loan being refinanced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If a veteran is deceased and if such veteran's surviving spouse was a co-obligor under an existing loan previously guaranteed, insured, or made for purposes specified in this section, such surviving spouse shall, only for the purpose specified in clause (F) of paragraph (1) of this subsection, be deemed to be a veteran eligible for benefits under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) For a loan to be guaranteed for the purpose specified in paragraph (1)(G) of this subsection or section 3710(a)(9)(B)(ii) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the loan must be secured by the same manufactured home as was the loan being refinanced and such manufactured home must be owned and occupied by the veteran (except as provided in section 3704(c)(2) of this title) as such veteran's home; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the amount (if any) determined by the Secretary to be appropriate under paragraph (2) of this subsection to cover the cost of necessary preparation of such lot,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) the balance of the loan being refinanced, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(IV) such closing costs (including any discount permitted pursuant to section 3703(c)(3)(E) of this title) as may be authorized by the Secretary, under regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, to be included in such loan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) When a loan is made to a veteran for the purpose specified in paragraph (1)(G) of this subsection or section 3710(a)(9)(B)(ii) of this title, and the loan being refinanced was guaranteed, insured, or made under this section, the portion of the loan made for the purpose of refinancing such loan may be guaranteed by the Secretary under this chapter without regard to the amount of outstanding guaranty entitlement available for use by such veteran, and the amount of such veteran's guaranty entitlement shall not be charged as a result of any guaranty provided for such portion of such loan. For the purposes of section 3702(b) of this title, such portion of such loan shall be deemed to have been obtained with the guaranty entitlement used to obtain the loan being refinanced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Use of entitlement for purposes specified in this section for the purchase of a manufactured home unit shall preclude the use of remaining entitlement for the purchase of an additional manufactured home unit until the unit which secured the loan has been disposed of by the veteran or has been destroyed by fire or other natural hazard.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon determining that a loan submitted for prior approval is eligible for guaranty for purposes specified in this section, the Secretary shall issue a commitment to guarantee such loan and shall thereafter guarantee the loan when made if such loan qualifies therefor in all respects.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) after liquidation of the security for the loan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the holder of a loan applies for payment of a claim under clause (i) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the amount of such claim payable by the Secretary shall be the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the amount equal to the excess, if any, of the total indebtedness over the amount of the appraisal referred to in such clause; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount equal to the guaranty under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(E) In any accounting filed pursuant to subparagraph (B)(ii) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall permit to be included therein accrued unpaid interest from the date of the first uncured default to such cutoff date as the Secretary may establish, and the Secretary shall allow the holder of the loan to charge against the liquidation or resale proceeds accrued interest from the cutoff date established to such further date as the Secretary may determine and such costs and expenses as the Secretary determines to be reasonable and proper.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) The liability of the United States under the guaranty provided for by this paragraph shall decrease or increase pro rata with any decrease or increase of the amount of the unpaid portion of the obligation.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:446 --><p class="statutory-body">(4) The maximum amount of guaranty entitlement available to a veteran for purposes specified in this section shall be $20,000 reduced by the amount of any such entitlement previously used by the veteran. Use of entitlement for purposes specified in section 3710 or 3711 of this title shall reduce entitlement available for use for purposes specified in this section to the same extent that entitlement available for purposes specified in such section 3710 is reduced below $20,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The amount of any loan guaranteed for purposes specified in this section shall not exceed an amount equal to 95 percent of the purchase price of the property securing the loan.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall preclude the Secretary, under regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, from consenting to necessary advances for the protection of the security or the holder's lien, to a reasonable extension of the term of such loan, or to a reasonable reamortization of such loan.</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(j) Subject to notice and opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary is authorized to deny guaranteed or direct loan financing in the case of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) manufactured homes constructed by a manufacturer who fails or is unable to discharge the manufacturer's obligations under the warranty;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3713. Release from liability under guaranty</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Whenever any veteran disposes of residential property securing a guaranteed, insured, or direct housing loan obtained by the veteran, the Secretary, upon application made by such veteran and by the transferee incident to such disposal, shall issue to such veteran in connection with such disposal a release relieving the veteran of all further liability to the Secretary on account of such loan (including liability for any loss resulting from any default of the transferee or any subsequent purchaser of such property) if the Secretary has determined, after such investigation as the Secretary may deem appropriate, that (1) the loan is current, and (2) the purchaser of such property from such veteran (A) is obligated by contract to purchase such property and to assume full liability for the repayment of the balance of the loan remaining unpaid, and has assumed by contract all of the obligations of the veteran under the terms of the instruments creating and securing the loan, and (B) qualifies from a credit standpoint, to the same extent as if the transferee were a veteran eligible for purposes specified in section 3710 of this title, for a guaranteed or insured or direct loan in an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the obligation for which the transferee has assumed liability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If any veteran disposes of residential property securing a guaranteed, insured, or direct housing loan obtained by the veteran under this chapter without receiving a release from liability with respect to such loan under subsection (a), and a default subsequently occurs which results in liability of the veteran to the Secretary on account of the loan, the Secretary may relieve the veteran of such liability if the Secretary determines, after such investigation as the Secretary deems appropriate, that the property was disposed of by the veteran in such a manner, and subject to such conditions, that the Secretary would have issued the veteran a release from liability under subsection (a) with respect to the loan if the veteran had made application therefor incident to such disposal. Failure of a transferee to assume by contract all of the liabilities of the original veteran-borrower shall bar such release of liability only in cases in which no acceptable transferee, either immediate or remote, is legally liable to the Sec<!-- PDFPage:451 -->retary for the indebtedness of the original veteran-borrower arising from termination of the loan. The failure of a veteran to qualify for release from liability under this subsection does not preclude relief from being granted under section 5302(b) of this title, if the veteran is eligible for relief under that section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) This section shall apply only to loans for which commitments are made before March 1, 1988.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), paragraph (3), and paragraph (4)(C)(ii) of this subsection, the Secretary shall be considered to be the holder of the loan if the actual holder is not an approved lender described in section 3702.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) In any case in which the holder of a loan described in subsection (a)(1) of this section has knowledge of a person's disposing of residential property securing the loan, the holder shall notify the Secretary of such action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the holder fails to notify the Secretary in such a case, the holder shall be liable to the Secretary for any damage sustained by the Secretary as a result of the holder's failure, as determined at the time the Secretary is required to make payments in accordance with any insurance or guaranty provided by the Secretary with respect to the loan concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary shall provide that the mortgage or deed of trust and any other instrument evidencing the loan entered into by a person with respect to a loan guaranteed, insured, or made under this chapter shall contain provisions, in such form as the Secretary shall specify, implementing the requirements of this section, and shall bear in conspicuous position in capital letters on the first page of the document in type at least 2 and 1/2 times larger than the regular type on such page the following: &ldquo;This loan is not assumable without the approval of the Department of Veterans Affairs or its authorized agent.&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, with respect to matters arising by reason of this chapter, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) sue and be sued in the Secretary's official capacity in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal, but nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorizing garnishment or attachment against the Secretary, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or any of its employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) subject to specific limitations in this chapter, consent to the modification, with respect to rate of interest, time of payment of principal or interest or any portion thereof, security or other provisions of any note, contract, mortgage or other instrument securing a loan which has been guaranteed, insured, made or acquired under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) pay, or compromise, any claim on, or arising because of, any such guaranty or insurance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) pay, compromise, waive or release any right, title, claim, lien or demand, however acquired, including any equity or any right of redemption;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) purchase at any sale, public or private, upon such terms and for such prices as the Secretary determines to be reasonable, and take title to, property, real, personal or mixed; and similarly sell, at public or private sale, exchange, assign, convey, or otherwise dispose of any such property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) complete, administer, operate, obtain and pay for insurance on, and maintain, renovate, repair, modernize, lease, or otherwise deal with any property acquired or held pursuant to this chapter. The acquisition of any such property shall not deprive any State or political subdivision thereof of its civil or criminal jurisdiction of, on, or over such property (including power to tax) or impair the rights under the State or local law of any persons on such property. Without regard to section 3302(b) of title 31 or any other provision of law not expressly in limitation of this paragraph, the Secretary may permit brokers utilized by the Secretary in connection with such properties to deduct from rental collections amounts covering authorized fees, costs, and expenses incurred in connection with the management, repair, sale, or lease of any such properties and remit the net balances to the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The powers granted by this section may be exercised by the Secretary without regard to any other provision of law not enacted expressly in limitation of this section, which otherwise would govern the expenditure of public funds; however, section 3709 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5) shall apply to any contract for services or supplies on account of any property acquired pursuant to this section if the amount of such contract exceeds the amount prescribed in clause (1) of the first sentence of such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The financial transactions of the Secretary incident to, or arising out of, the guaranty or insurance of loans pursuant to this chapter, and the acquisition, management, and disposition of property, real, personal, or mixed, incident to such activities and pursuant to this section, shall be final and conclusive upon all officers of the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The right to redeem provided for by section 2410(c) of title 28 shall not arise in any case in which the subordinate lien or interest of the United States derives from a guaranteed or insured loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) The Secretary is authorized from time to time, as the Secretary determines advisable, to set aside first mortgage loans, and installment sale contracts, owned and held by the Secretary under this chapter as the basis for the sale of participation certificates as herein provided. For this purpose the Secretary may enter into agreements, including trust agreements, with the Government National Mortgage Association, and any other Federal agency, under which the Association as fiduciary may sell certificates of participation based on principal and interest collections to be received by the Secretary and the Association or any other such agency on first mortgage loans and installment sale contracts comprising mortgage pools established by them. The agreement may provide for substitution or withdrawal of mortgage loans, or installment sale contracts, or for substitution of cash for mortgages in the pool. The agreement shall provide that the Government National Mortgage Association shall promptly pay to the Secretary the entire proceeds of any sale of certificates of participation to the extent such certificates are based on mortgages, including installment sale contracts, set aside by the Sec<!-- PDFPage:454 -->retary and the Secretary shall periodically pay to the Association, as fiduciary, such funds as are required for payment of interest and principal due on outstanding certificates of participation to the extent of the pro rata amount allocated to the Secretary pursuant to the agreement. The agreement shall also provide that the Secretary shall retain ownership of mortgage loans and installment sale contracts set aside by the Secretary pursuant to the agreement unless transfer of ownership to the fiduciary is required in the event of default or probable default in the payment of participation certificates. The Secretary is authorized to purchase outstanding certificates of participation to the extent of the amount of the Secretary's commitment to the fiduciary on participations outstanding and to pay the Secretary's proper share of the costs and expenses incurred by the Government National Mortgage Association as fiduciary pursuant to the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall proportionately allocate and deposit the entire proceeds received from the sale of participations into the funds established pursuant to sections 3723 and 3724 of this chapter, as determined on an estimated basis, and the amounts so deposited shall be available for the purposes of the funds. The Secretary may nevertheless make such allocations of that part of the proceeds of participation sales representing anticipated interest collections on mortgage loans, including installment sale contracts, on other than an estimated proportionate basis if determined necessary to assure payment of interest on advances theretofore made to the Secretary by the Secretary of the Treasury for direct loan purposes. The Secretary shall set aside and maintain necessary reserves in the funds established pursuant to sections 3723 and 3724 of this chapter to be used for meeting commitments pursuant to this subsection and, as the Secretary determines to be necessary, for meeting interest payments on advances by the Secretary of the Treasury for direct loan purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Whenever loss, destruction, or damage to any residential property securing loans guaranteed, insured, made, or acquired by the Secretary under this chapter occurs as the result of a major disaster as determined by the President under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), the Secretary shall (1) provide counseling and such other service to the owner of such property as may be feasible and shall inform such owner concerning the disaster assistance available from other Federal agencies and from State or local agencies, and (2) pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section, extend on an individual case basis such forebearance or indulgence to such owner as the Secretary determines to be warranted by the facts of the case and the circumstances of such owner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Secretary shall, at the request of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and without reimbursement, certify to such Secretary whether an applicant for assistance under any law administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development is a veteran.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) The Secretary may, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary considers appropriate, issue or approve the issuance of, and guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on, certificates or other securities evidencing an interest in a pool of mortgage loans made in connection with the sale of properties acquired under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not under this subsection guarantee the payment of principal and interest on certificates or other securities issued or approved after December 31, 2002.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3723. Direct loan revolving fund</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) For the purposes of section 3711 of this title, the revolving fund heretofore established by section 513 of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 is continued in effect. For the purposes of further augmenting the revolving fund, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to advance to the Secretary from time to time after December 31, 1958, and until June 30, 1961, such sums (not in excess of $150,000,000 in any one fiscal year, including prior advancements in fiscal year 1959) as the Secretary may request, except that the aggregate so advanced in any one quarter annual period shall not exceed the sum of $50,000,000, less that amount which has been returned to the revolving fund during the preceding quarter annual period from the sale of loans pursuant to section 3711(g) of this title. In addition to the sums authorized in this subsection the Secretary of the Treasury shall also advance to the Secretary such additional sums, not in excess of $100,000,000, as the Secretary may request, and the sums so advanced shall be made available without regard to any limitation contained in this subsection with respect to the amount which may be advanced in any one quarter annual period. The Secretary of the Treasury shall also advance to the Secretary from time to time such additional sums as the Secretary may request, not in excess of $100,000,000 to be immediately available, plus an additional amount not in excess of $400,000,000 after June 30, 1961, plus $200,000,000 after June 30, 1962, plus $150,000,000 after June 30, 1963, plus $150,000,000 after June 30, 1964, plus $100,000,000 after June 30, 1965, plus $100,000,000 after June 30, 1966. Any such authorized advance which is not requested by the Secretary in the fiscal year in which the advance may be made shall be made thereafter when requested by the Secretary, except that no such request or advance may be made after June 30, 1967. Such authorized advances are not subject to the quarter annual limitation in the second sentence of this subsection, but the amount authorized to be advanced in any fiscal year after June 30, 1962, shall be reduced only by the amount which has been returned to the revolving fund during the preceding fiscal year from the sale of loans pursuant to section 3711(g) of this title. In addition the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to make available to the Secretary for this purpose from time to time as the Secretary may request the amount of any funds which may have been deposited to the credit of miscellaneous receipts under this subsection or subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) On advances to such revolving fund by the Secretary of the Treasury, less those amounts deposited in miscellaneous receipts under subsections (a) and (c) the Secretary shall pay semiannually to the Treasurer of the United States interest at the rate or rates determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average rate on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States as of the last day of the month preceding the advance. The Secretary shall not be required to pay interest on transfers made pursuant to the Act of February 13, 1962 (76 Stat. 8), from the capital of the &ldquo;direct loans to veterans and reserves revolving fund&rdquo; to the &ldquo;loan guaranty revolving fund&rdquo; and adjustments shall be made for payments of interest on such transfers before February 29, 1964.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In order to make advances to such revolving fund, as authorized by law to effectuate the purposes and functions authorized in section <!-- PDFPage:457 -->3711 of this title, the Secretary of the Treasury may use, as a public debt transaction, the proceeds of the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 include such purposes. Such sums, together with all receipts under this section and section 3711 of this title, shall be deposited with the Treasurer of the United States, in a special deposit account, and shall be available, respectively, for disbursement for the purposes of section 3711 of this title. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall from time to time cause to be deposited into the Treasury of the United States, to the credit of miscellaneous receipts, such of the funds in such account as in the Secretary's judgment are not needed for the purposes for which they were provided, including the proceeds of the sale of any loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer from the direct loan revolving fund to the loan guaranty revolving fund established by section 3724(a) of this title such amounts as the Secretary determines are not needed in the direct loan revolving fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 30 days after the date on which the Secretary of the Treasury makes a transfer under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall submit a notice of such transfer to the appropriate committees of the Congress.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary shall select appraisers from a list required by subsection (a)(3) of this section on a rotating basis to make appraisals for the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If uniform qualifications become applicable for appraisers who perform appraisals for or in connection with the Federal Government, the qualifications required by subsection (a)(1) of this section may be more stringent than such uniform qualifications, but the Secretary may use no written test in determining the qualifications of appraisers other than the test prescribed to implement such uniform qualifications.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, the appraiser shall forward an appraisal report to the Secretary for review. Upon receipt of such report, the Secretary shall determine the reasonable value of the property, construction, repairs, or alterations for purposes of this chapter, and notify the veteran of such determination.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may provide financial assistance to veterans&rsquo; small business concerns for the purpose of (A) financing plant construction, conversion, or expansion (including the acquisition of land), (B) financing the acquisition of equipment, facilities, machinery, supplies, or materials, or (C) supplying such concerns with working capital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to paragraph (3)(A) of this subsection, financial assistance under this section may be provided in the form of (A) loan guaranties, or (B) direct loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall specify in regulations the criteria to be met for a business concern to qualify as a veterans&rsquo; small business concern for the purposes of this subchapter. Such regulations shall include requirements&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that at least 51 percent of a business concern must be owned by individuals who are veterans of the Vietnam era or disabled veterans in order for such concern to qualify for a loan guaranty and that at least 51 percent of a business concern must be owned by disabled veterans in order for such concern to qualify for a direct loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that the management and daily business operations of the concern must be directed by one or more of the veterans whose ownership interest is part of the majority ownership for the purposes of meeting the requirement in clause (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The availability of financial assistance under subsection (a) of this section is subject to the following limitations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Secretary may not make a direct loan under this section unless the veterans&rsquo; small business concern applying for the loan shows to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the concern is unable to obtain a loan guaranteed by the Department under this section or made or guaranteed by the Small Business Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Secretary may not guarantee a loan under this section if the loan bears a rate of interest in excess of the maximum rate of interest prescribed under section 3745 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Secretary may not make or guarantee a loan under this section for an amount in excess of $200,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The original liability of the Secretary on any loan guaranteed under this section may not exceed 90 percent of the amount of the loan, and such liability shall decrease or increase pro rata with any decrease or increase of the amount of the unpaid portion of the loan, but such liability may not exceed the amount of the original guaranty.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Each loan made or guaranteed under this subchapter shall be of such sound value, taking into account the creditworthiness of the veterans&rsquo; small business concern (and the individual owners) applying for such loan, or so secured as reasonably to assure payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Secretary may not make or guarantee a loan under this subchapter to a veterans&rsquo; small business concern in which an ownership interest is held by a veteran who also has an ownership interest in another small business concern if such ownership interest was considered in qualifying that other concern for an outstanding loan made or guaranteed under this subchapter or the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply if 51 percent or more of the business concern seeking a direct or guaranteed loan under this subchapter is owned by veterans of the Vietnam era or disabled veterans without including the ownership interest of the veteran whose ownership interest in another small business concern was previously considered in qualifying that other concern for an outstanding guaranteed or direct business loan under this subchapter or the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) In order to protect the interest of the United States, upon application by a veterans&rsquo; small business concern which is the recipient of a loan guaranteed under this subchapter, the <!-- PDFPage:475 -->Secretary (subject to the provisions of this subsection) may undertake the veterans&rsquo; small business concern's obligation to make payments under such loan or, if the loan was a direct loan made by the Secretary, may suspend such obligation. While such payments are being made by the Secretary pursuant to the undertaking of such obligation or while such obligation is suspended, no such payment with respect to the loan may be required from the concern.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may undertake or suspend a veterans&rsquo; small business concern's obligation under this subsection only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such undertaking or suspension of the obligation is, in the judgment of the Secretary, necessary to protect the interest of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with the undertaking or suspension of the obligation, the small business concern would, in the judgment of the Secretary, become or remain a viable small business entity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the small business concern executes an agreement in writing satisfactory to the Secretary as provided by paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The period of time for which the Secretary undertakes or suspends the obligation on a loan under this subsection may not exceed five years. The Secretary may extend the maturity of any loan on which the Secretary undertakes or suspends the obligation under this subsection for a corresponding period of time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Before the Secretary may undertake or suspend a veterans&rsquo; small business concern's obligation under this subsection, the Secretary shall require the small business concern to execute an agreement to repay the aggregate amount of the payments which were required under the loan during the period for which the obligation was undertaken or suspended&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) by periodic payments not less in amount or less frequently falling due than those which were due under the loan during such period,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) pursuant to a repayment schedule agreed upon by the Secretary and the small business concern, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) by a combination of the method of payments described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In addition to requiring the small business concern to execute the agreement described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall, before the undertaking or suspension of the obligation, take such action and require the small business concern to take such action as the Secretary considers appropriate in the circumstances, including the provision of such security as the Secretary considers necessary or appropriate, to assure that the rights and interest of the United States and any lender will be safeguarded adequately during and after the period in which such obligation is so undertaken or suspended.</p>
