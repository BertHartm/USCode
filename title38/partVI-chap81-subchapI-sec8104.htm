<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The purpose of this subsection is to enable Congress to ensure the equitable distribution of medical facilities throughout the United States, taking into consideration the comparative urgency of the need for the services to be provided in the case of each particular facility.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:905 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) No funds may be appropriated for any fiscal year, and the Secretary may not obligate or expend funds (other than for advance planning and design), for any major medical facility project or any major medical facility lease unless funds for that project or lease have been specifically authorized by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purpose of this subsection:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;major medical facility project&rdquo; means a project for the construction, alteration, or acquisition of a medical facility involving a total expenditure of more than $10,000,000, but such term does not include an acquisition by exchange.</p>

Any such prospectus shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A detailed estimate of the total costs of the medical facility to be constructed, altered, leased, or otherwise acquired under this subchapter, including a description of the location of such facility and, in the case of a prospectus proposing the construction of a new or replacement medical facility, a detailed report of the consideration that was given to acquiring an existing facility by lease or purchase and to the sharing of health-care resources with the Department of Defense under section 8111 of this title. Such detailed estimate shall include an identification of each of the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The priority score assigned to the project or lease under the Department's prioritization methodology and, if the project or lease is being proposed for funding before a project or lease with a higher score, a specific explanation of the factors other than the priority score that were considered and the basis on which the project or lease is proposed for funding ahead of projects or leases with higher priority scores.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) In the case of a prospectus proposing the construction of a new or replacement medical facility, each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A detailed estimate of the total costs (including total construction costs, activation costs, special purpose alterations (lump-sum payment) costs, number of personnel and total costs of ancillary services, equipment and all other items) for each alternative to construction of the facility that was considered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A comparison of total costs to total benefits for each such alternative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) An explanation of why the preferred alternative is the most effective means to achieve the stated project goals and the most cost-effective alternative.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Not less than 30 days before obligating funds for a major medical facility project approved by a law described in subsection (a)(2) of this section in an amount that would cause the total amount obligated for that project to exceed the amount specified in the law for that project (or would add to total obligations exceeding such specified amount) by more than 10 percent, the Secretary shall provide the committees with notice of the Secretary's intention to do so and the reasons for the specified amount being exceeded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), in any case in which the Secretary proposes that funds be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which such funds were appropriated, the Secretary shall promptly notify each committee, in writing, of the particulars involved and the reasons why such funds were not used for the purpose for which appropriated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In any fiscal year, unobligated amounts in the Construction, Major Projects account that are a direct result of bid savings from a major construction project may only be obligated for major construction projects authorized for that fiscal year or a previous fiscal year.</p>
