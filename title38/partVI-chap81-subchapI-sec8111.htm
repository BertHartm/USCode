Guidelines established under this subsection shall provide for such sharing consistent with the health-care responsibilities of the Department under this title and with the health-care responsibilities of the Department of Defense under chapter 55 of title 10 and so as not to adversely affect the range of services, the quality of care, or the established priorities for care provided by either agency.</p>
