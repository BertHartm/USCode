During odd-numbered fiscal years, the Under Secretary for Health shall be the chairman of the Committee. During even-numbered fiscal years, the Assistant Secretary shall be the chairman of the Committee. The agencies shall provide administrative support services for the Committee at a level sufficient for the efficient operation of the Committee and shall share the responsibility for the provision of such services on an equitable basis.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) After considering the recommendations made under subsection (b)(4) of this section, the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense shall jointly establish guidelines to promote the sharing of health-care resources between the agencies. Guidelines established under this subsection shall provide for such sharing consistent with the health-care responsibilities of the Department under this title and with the health-care responsibilities of the Department of Defense under chapter 55 of title 10 and so as not to adversely affect the range of services, the quality of care, or the established priorities for care provided by either agency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each such agreement shall identify the health-care resources to be shared.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each such agreement shall provide, and shall specify procedures designed to ensure, that the availability of direct health care to individuals who are not primary beneficiaries of the providing agency (A) is on a referral basis from the facility of the other agency, and (B) does not (as determined by the head of the facility of the providing agency) adversely affect the range of services, the quality of care, or the established priorities for care provided to the primary beneficiaries of the providing agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each such agreement shall provide that a providing agency shall be reimbursed for the cost of the health-care resources provided under the agreement and that the rate for such reimbursement shall be determined in accordance with the methodology agreed to pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Each proposal for an agreement under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be submitted to <!-- PDFPage:769 -->the Under Secretary for Health and the Assistant Secretary and shall be effective as an agreement in accordance with its terms (A) on the forty-sixth day after the receipt of such proposal by both such officials, unless earlier disapproved by either such official, or (B) if earlier approved by both such officials, on the date of such approval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Reimbursement under any sharing agreement entered into under subsection (d) of this section shall be based upon a methodology that is agreed upon by the Under Secretary for Health and the Assistant Secretary and that provides appropriate flexibility to the heads of the facilities concerned to take into account local conditions and needs and the actual costs to the providing agency's facility of the health-care resources provided. Any funds received through such a reimbursement shall be credited to funds that have been allotted to the facility that provided the care or services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) At the time the President's Budget is transmitted to Congress in any year pursuant to section 1105 of title 31, the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense shall submit a joint report to Congress on the implementation of this section during the fiscal year that ended during the previous calendar year. Each such report shall include&mdash;</p>
