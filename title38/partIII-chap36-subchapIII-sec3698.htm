Such institution shall deliver such payment to the eligible veteran as soon as practicable after receipt thereof. Upon delivery of such payment to the eligible veteran, such educational institution shall promptly submit to the Secretary a certification, on such form as the Secretary shall prescribe, of such delivery, and such delivery shall be deemed to be an advance payment under section 3680(d)(4) of this title for purposes of section 3684(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) The Secretary shall conduct, on a continuing basis, a review of the default experience with respect to loans made under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) To ensure that loans are made under this section on the basis of financial need directly related to the costs of education, the Secretary may, by regulation, establish (i) criteria for eligibility for such loans, in addition to the criteria and requirements prescribed by subsections (c) and (d) of this section, in order to limit eligibility for such loans to eligible veterans attending educational institutions with relatively high rates of tuition and fees, and (ii) criteria under which the Secretary may prescribe a repayment period for certain types of loans made under this section that is shorter than the repayment period otherwise applicable under subsection (d)(1)(A) of this section. Criteria established by the Secretary under clause (i) of the preceding sentence may include a minimum amount of tuition and fees that an eligible veteran may pay in order to be eligible for such a loan (except that any such criterion shall not apply with respect to a loan for which the veteran is eligible as a result of an extension of the period of eligibility of such veteran for loans under this section provided for by section 3462(a)(2) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In prescribing regulations under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall take into consideration information developed in the course of the review required by paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
