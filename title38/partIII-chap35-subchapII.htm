<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Each eligible person shall be entitled to educational assistance under this chapter for a period not in excess of 45 months (or to the equivalent thereof in part-time training).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or chapter 36 of this title, any payment of an educational assistance allowance described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) be charged against the entitlement of any individual under this chapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) be counted toward the aggregate period for which section 3695 of this title limits an individual's receipt of assistance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The payment of the educational assistance allowance referred to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph is the payment of such an allowance to an individual for pursuit of a course or courses under this chapter if the Secretary finds that the individual&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) had to discontinue such course pursuit as a result of being ordered, in connection with the Persian Gulf War, to serve on active duty under section 672(a), (d), or (g), 673, 673b,<sup><a href="#3511_1_target" name="3511_1">1</a></sup> or 688 of title 10; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) failed to receive credit or training time toward completion of the individual's approved educational, professional, or vocational objective as a result of having to discontinue, as described in clause (i) of this subparagraph, his or her course pursuit.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The period for which, by reason of this subsection, an educational assistance allowance is not charged against entitlement or counted toward the applicable aggregate period under section 3695 of this title shall not exceed the portion of the period of enrollment in the course or courses for which the individual failed to receive credit or with respect to which the individual lost training time, as determined under subparagraph (B)(ii) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If any eligible person pursuing a program of education, or of special restorative training, under this chapter ceases to be an &ldquo;eligible person&rdquo; because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the parent or spouse from whom eligibility is derived is found no longer to have a &ldquo;total disability permanent in nature&rdquo;, as defined in section 3501(a)(8) of this title,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the parent or spouse from whom eligibility is derived based upon the provisions of section 3501(a)(1)(A)(iii) or 3501(a)(1)(C) of this title is no longer listed in one of the categories specified therein, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the spouse, as an eligible person under section 3501(a)(1)(D) of this title, is divorced, without fault on such person's part, from the person upon whose disability such person's eligibility is based,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then such eligible person (if such person has sufficient remaining entitlement) may, nevertheless, be afforded educational assistance under this chapter until the end of the quarter or semester for which enrolled if the educational institution in which such person is enrolled is operated on a quarter or semester system, or if the educational institution is not so operated until the end of the course, or until 12 weeks have expired, whichever first occurs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if the person is above the age of compulsory school attendance under applicable State law, and the Secretary determines that the person's best interests will be served thereby, such period may begin before the person's eighteenth birthday;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the person has a mental or physical handicap, and the Secretary determines that the person's best interests will be served by pursuing a program of special restorative training or a specialized course of vocational training approved under section 3536 of this title, such period may begin before the person's eighteenth birthday, but not before the person's fourteenth birthday;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if the Secretary first finds that the parent from whom eligibility is derived has a service-connected total disability permanent in nature, or if the death of the parent from whom eligibility is derived occurs, after the eligible person's eighteenth birthday but before the person's twenty-sixth birthday, then (unless paragraph (4) applies) such period shall end 8 years after, whichever date last occurs: (A) the date on which the Secretary first finds that the parent from whom eligibility is derived has a service-connected total disability permanent in nature, or (B) the date of death of the parent from whom eligibility is derived;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) if the person serves on duty with the Armed Forces as an eligible person after the person's eighteenth birthday but before the person's twenty-sixth birthday, then such period shall end 8 years after the person's first discharge or release from such duty with the Armed Forces (excluding from such 8 years all periods during which the eligible person served on active duty before August 1, 1962, pursuant to (A) a call or order thereto issued to the person as a Reserve after July 30, 1961, or (B) an extension of enlistment, appointment, or period of duty with the Armed Forces pursuant to section 2 of Public Law 87&ndash;117); however, in no event shall such period be extended beyond the person's thirty-first birthday by reason of this paragraph;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) if the person becomes eligible by reason of the provisions of section 3501(a)(1)(A)(iii) of this title after the person's eighteenth birthday but before the person's twenty-sixth birthday, then (unless clause (4) of this subsection applies) such period shall end eight years after the date on which the person becomes eligible by reason of such provisions, but in no event shall such period be extended beyond the person's thirty-first birthday by reason of this clause; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6)(A) if such person is enrolled in an educational institution regularly operated on the quarter or semester system and such period ends during a quarter or semester, such period shall be extended to the end of the quarter or semester; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if such person is enrolled in an educational institution operated on other than a quarter or semester system and such period ends after a major portion of the course is completed, such period shall be extended to the end of the course, or until 12 weeks have expired, whichever first occurs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) No person made eligible by section 3501(a)(1)(B) or (D) of this title may be afforded educational assistance under this chapter beyond 10 years after whichever of the following last occurs:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:349 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The date on which the Secretary first finds the spouse from whom eligibility is derived has a service-connected total disability permanent in nature.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The date of death of the spouse from whom eligibility is derived who dies while a total disability evaluated as permanent in nature was in existence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The date on which the Secretary determines that the spouse from whom eligibility is derived died of a service-connected disability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, in the case of any eligible person (as defined in section 3501(a)(1)(B), (C), or (D) of this title) who was prevented from initiating or completing such person's chosen program of education within such period because of a physical or mental disability which was not the result of such person's own willful misconduct, such person shall, upon application made within one year after (A) the last date of the delimiting period otherwise applicable under this section, (B) the termination of the period of mental or physical disability, or (C) October 1, 1980, whichever is the latest, be granted an extension of the applicable delimiting period for such length of time as the Secretary determines, from the evidence, that such person was so prevented from initiating or completing such program of education. When an extension of the applicable delimiting period is granted under the exception in the preceding sentence, the delimiting period will again begin running on the first day following such eligible person's recovery from such disability on which it is reasonably feasible, as determined in accordance with regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, for such eligible person to initiate or resume pursuit of a program of education with educational assistance under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, any eligible person (as defined in clause (B) or (D) of section 3501(a)(1) of this title) may, subject to the approval of the Secretary, be permitted to elect a date referred to in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph to commence receiving educational assistance benefits under this chapter. The date so elected shall be the beginning date of the delimiting period applicable to such person under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The date which an eligible person may elect under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph is any date during the period beginning on the date the person became an eligible person within the meaning of clause (B) or (D) of section 3501(a)(1) of this title and ending on the date determined under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1) of this subsection to be applicable to such person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, an eligible person may be afforded educational assistance beyond the age limitation applicable to such person under such subsection if (1) such person suspends pursuit of such person's program of education after having enrolled in such program within the time period applicable to such person under such subsection, (2) such person is unable to complete such program after the period of suspension and before attaining the age limitation applicable to such person under such subsection, and (3) the Secretary finds that the suspension was due to conditions beyond the control of such person; but in no event shall educational assistance be afforded such person by reason of this subsection beyond the age limitation applicable to such person under subsection (a) of this section plus a period of time equal to the period such person was required to suspend the pursuit of such person's program, or beyond such person's thirty-first birthday, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The term &ldquo;first finds&rdquo; as used in this section means the effective date of the rating or date of notification to the veteran from whom eligibility is derived establishing a service-connected total disability permanent in nature whichever is more advantageous to the eligible person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) No person made eligible by section 3501(a)(1)(C) of this title may be afforded educational assistance under this chapter beyond 10 years after the date on which the spouse was listed by the Secretary concerned in one of the categories referred to in such section or December 24, 1970, whichever last occurs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Any eligible person (as defined in section 3501(a)(1)(B), (C), or (D) of this chapter) shall be entitled to an additional period of eligibility for an education loan under subchapter III of chapter 36 of this title beyond the maximum period provided for in this section pursuant to the same terms and conditions set forth with respect to an eligible veteran in section 3462(a)(2) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Any entitlement used by any eligible person as a result of eligibility under the provisions of section 3501(a)(1)(A)(iii) or 3501(a)(1)(C) of this title shall be deducted from any entitlement to which such person may subsequently become entitled under the provisions of this chapter.</p>
