<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Secretary may recognize representatives of the American National Red Cross, the American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, the United Spanish War Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and such other organizations as the Secretary may approve, in the preparation, presentation, and prosecution of claims under laws administered by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may, in the discretion of the Secretary, furnish, if available, space and office facilities for the use of paid full-time representatives of national organizations so recognized.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) unless, with respect to each claim, such individual has filed with the Secretary a power of attorney, executed in such manner and form as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Unless a claimant specifically indicates in a power of attorney filed with the Department a desire to appoint only a recognized representative of an organization listed in or approved under subsection (a), the Secretary may, for any purpose, treat the power of attorney naming such an organization, a specific office of such an organization, or a recognized representative of such an organization as the claimant's representative as an appointment of the entire organization as the claimant's representative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever the Secretary is required or permitted to notify a claimant's representative, and the claimant has named in a power of attorney an organization listed in or approved under subsection (a), a specific office of such an organization, or a recognized representative of such an organization without specifically indicating a desire to appoint only a recognized representative of the organization, the Secretary shall notify the organization at the address designated by the organization for the purpose of receiving the notification concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Service rendered in connection with any such claim, while not on active duty, by any retired officer, warrant officer, or enlisted member of the Armed Forces recognized under this section shall not be a violation of sections 203, 205, 206, or 207 of title 18.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;5904. Recognition of agents and attorneys generally</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary may recognize any individual as an agent or attorney for the preparation, presentation, and prosecution of claims under laws administered by the Secretary. The Secretary may require that individuals, before being recognized under this section, show that they are of good moral character and in good repute, are qualified to render claimants valuable service, and otherwise are competent to assist claimants in presenting claims.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, may suspend or exclude from further practice before the Department any agent or attorney recognized under this section if the Secretary finds that such agent or attorney&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has engaged in any unlawful, unprofessional, or dishonest practice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has been guilty of disreputable conduct;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is incompetent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) has violated or refused to comply with any of the laws administered by the Secretary, or with any of the regulations or instructions governing practice before the Department; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) has in any manner deceived, misled, or threatened any actual or prospective claimant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), in connection with a proceeding before the Department with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary, a fee may not be charged, allowed, or paid for services of agents and attorneys with respect to services provided before the date on which the Board of Veterans&rsquo; Appeals first makes a final decision in the case. Such a fee may be charged, allowed, or paid in the case of services provided after such date only if an agent or attorney is retained with respect to such case before the end of the one-year period beginning on that date. The limitation in the preceding sentence does not apply to services provided with respect to proceedings before a court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person who, acting as agent or attorney in a case referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, represents a person before the Department or the Board of Veterans&rsquo; Appeals after the Board first makes a final decision in the case shall file a copy of any fee agreement between them with the Board at such time as may be specified by the Board. The Board, upon its own motion or the request of either party, may review such a fee agreement and may order a reduction in the fee called for in the agreement if the Board finds that the fee is excessive or unreasonable. A finding or order of the Board under the preceding sentence may be reviewed by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims under section 7263(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A reasonable fee may be charged or paid in connection with any proceeding before the Department in a case arising out of a loan made, guaranteed, or insured under chapter 37 of this title. A person who charges a fee under this paragraph shall enter into a written agreement with the person represented and shall file a copy of the fee agreement with the Secretary at such time, and in such manner, as may be specified by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) When a claimant and an attorney have entered into a fee agreement described in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the total fee payable to the attorney may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A fee agreement referred to in paragraph (1) is one under which the total amount of the fee payable to the attorney&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) is contingent on whether or not the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, a claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:656 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) To the extent that past-due benefits are awarded in any proceeding before the Secretary, the Board of Veterans&rsquo; Appeals, or the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, the Secretary may direct that payment of any attorneys&rsquo; fee under a fee arrangement described in paragraph (1) of this subsection be made out of such past-due benefits. In no event may the Secretary withhold for the purpose of such payment any portion of benefits payable for a period after the date of the final decision of the Secretary, the Board of Veterans&rsquo; Appeals, or Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims making (or ordering the making of) the award.</p>
