<p class="statutory-body">(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, with respect to matters arising by reason of this chapter, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) sue and be sued in the Secretary's official capacity in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal, but nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorizing garnishment or attachment against the Secretary, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or any of its employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) subject to specific limitations in this chapter, consent to the modification, with respect to rate of interest, time of payment of principal or interest or any portion thereof, security or other provisions of any note, contract, mortgage or other instrument securing a loan which has been guaranteed, insured, made or acquired under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) pay, or compromise, any claim on, or arising because of, any such guaranty or insurance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) pay, compromise, waive or release any right, title, claim, lien or demand, however acquired, including any equity or any right of redemption;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) purchase at any sale, public or private, upon such terms and for such prices as the Secretary determines to be reasonable, and take title to, property, real, personal or mixed; and similarly sell, at public or private sale, exchange, assign, convey, or otherwise dispose of any such property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) complete, administer, operate, obtain and pay for insurance on, and maintain, renovate, repair, modernize, lease, or otherwise deal with any property acquired or held pursuant to this chapter. The acquisition of any such property shall not deprive any State or political subdivision thereof of its civil or criminal jurisdiction of, on, or over such property (including power to tax) or impair the rights under the State or local law of any persons on such property. Without regard to section 3302(b) of title 31 or any other provision of law not expressly in limitation of this paragraph, the Secretary may permit brokers utilized by the Secretary in connection with such properties to deduct from rental collections amounts covering authorized fees, costs, and expenses incurred in connection with the management, repair, sale, or lease of any such properties and remit the net balances to the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The powers granted by this section may be exercised by the Secretary without regard to any other provision of law not enacted expressly in limitation of this section, which otherwise <!-- PDFPage:446 -->would govern the expenditure of public funds; however, section 3709 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5) shall apply to any contract for services or supplies on account of any property acquired pursuant to this section if the amount of such contract exceeds the amount prescribed in clause (1) of the first sentence of such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The financial transactions of the Secretary incident to, or arising out of, the guaranty or insurance of loans pursuant to this chapter, and the acquisition, management, and disposition of property, real, personal, or mixed, incident to such activities and pursuant to this section, shall be final and conclusive upon all officers of the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The right to redeem provided for by section 2410(c) of title 28 shall not arise in any case in which the subordinate lien or interest of the United States derives from a guaranteed or insured loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) The Secretary is authorized from time to time, as the Secretary determines advisable, to set aside first mortgage loans, and installment sale contracts, owned and held by the Secretary under this chapter as the basis for the sale of participation certificates as herein provided. For this purpose the Secretary may enter into agreements, including trust agreements, with the Government National Mortgage Association, and any other Federal agency, under which the Association as fiduciary may sell certificates of participation based on principal and interest collections to be received by the Secretary and the Association or any other such agency on first mortgage loans and installment sale contracts comprising mortgage pools established by them. The agreement may provide for substitution or withdrawal of mortgage loans, or installment sale contracts, or for substitution of cash for mortgages in the pool. The agreement shall provide that the Government National Mortgage Association shall promptly pay to the Secretary the entire proceeds of any sale of certificates of participation to the extent such certificates are based on mortgages, including installment sale contracts, set aside by the Secretary and the Secretary shall periodically pay to the Association, as fiduciary, such funds as are required for payment of interest and principal due on outstanding certificates of participation to the extent of the pro rata amount allocated to the Secretary pursuant to the agreement. The agreement shall also provide that the Secretary shall retain ownership of mortgage loans and installment sale contracts set aside by the Secretary pursuant to the agreement unless transfer of ownership to the fiduciary is required in the event of default or probable default in the payment of participation certificates. The Secretary is authorized to purchase outstanding certificates of participation to the extent of the amount of the Secretary's commitment to the fiduciary on participations outstanding and to pay the Secretary's proper share of the costs and expenses incurred by the Government National Mortgage Association as fiduciary pursuant to the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall proportionately allocate and deposit the entire proceeds received from the sale of participations into the funds established pursuant to sections 3723 and 3724 of this chapter, as determined on an estimated basis, and the amounts so deposited shall be available for the purposes of the funds. The Secretary may nevertheless make such allocations of that part of the proceeds of participation sales representing anticipated interest collections on mortgage loans, including installment sale contracts, on other than an estimated proportionate basis if determined necessary to assure payment of interest on advances theretofore made to the Secretary by the Secretary of the Treasury for direct loan purposes. The Secretary shall set aside and maintain necessary reserves in the funds established pursuant to sections 3723 and 3724 of this chapter to be used for meeting commitments pursuant to this subsection and, as the Secretary determines to be necessary, for meeting interest payments on advances by the Secretary of the Treasury for direct loan purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Whenever loss, destruction, or damage to any residential property securing loans guaranteed, insured, made, or acquired by the Secretary under this chapter occurs as the result of a major disaster as determined by the President under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), the Secretary shall (1) provide counseling and such other service to the owner of such property as may be feasible and shall inform such owner concerning the disaster assistance available from other Federal agencies and from State or local agencies, and (2) pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section, extend on an individual case basis such forebearance or indulgence to such owner as the Secretary determines to be warranted by the facts of the case and the circumstances of such owner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Secretary shall, at the request of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and without reimbursement, certify to such Secretary whether an applicant for assistance under any law administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development is a veteran.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) The Secretary may, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary considers appropriate, issue or approve the issuance of, and guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on, certificates or other securities evidencing an interest in a pool of mortgage loans made in connection with the sale of properties acquired under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not under this subsection guarantee the payment of principal and interest on certificates or other securities issued or approved after December 31, 1997.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) For the purposes of section 3711 of this title, the revolving fund heretofore established by section 513 of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 is continued in effect. For the purposes of further augmenting the revolving fund, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to advance to the Secretary from time to time after December 31, 1958, and until June 30, 1961, such sums (not in excess of $150,000,000 in any one fiscal year, including prior advancements in fiscal year 1959) as the Secretary may request, except that the aggregate so advanced in any one quarter annual period shall not exceed the sum of $50,000,000, less that amount which has been returned to the revolving fund during the preceding quarter annual period from the sale of loans pursuant to section 3711(g) of this title. In addition to the sums authorized in this subsection the Secretary of the Treasury shall also advance to the Secretary such additional sums, not in excess of $100,000,000, as the Secretary may request, and the sums so advanced shall be made available without regard to any limitation contained in this subsection with respect to the amount which may be advanced in any one quarter annual period. The Secretary of the Treasury shall also advance to the Secretary from time to time such additional sums as the Secretary may request, not in ex<!-- PDFPage:449 -->cess of $100,000,000 to be immediately available, plus an additional amount not in excess of $400,000,000 after June 30, 1961, plus $200,000,000 after June 30, 1962, plus $150,000,000 after June 30, 1963, plus $150,000,000 after June 30, 1964, plus $100,000,000 after June 30, 1965, plus $100,000,000 after June 30, 1966. Any such authorized advance which is not requested by the Secretary in the fiscal year in which the advance may be made shall be made thereafter when requested by the Secretary, except that no such request or advance may be made after June 30, 1967. Such authorized advances are not subject to the quarter annual limitation in the second sentence of this subsection, but the amount authorized to be advanced in any fiscal year after June 30, 1962, shall be reduced only by the amount which has been returned to the revolving fund during the preceding fiscal year from the sale of loans pursuant to section 3711(g) of this title. In addition the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to make available to the Secretary for this purpose from time to time as the Secretary may request the amount of any funds which may have been deposited to the credit of miscellaneous receipts under this subsection or subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) On advances to such revolving fund by the Secretary of the Treasury, less those amounts deposited in miscellaneous receipts under subsections (a) and (c) the Secretary shall pay semiannually to the Treasurer of the United States interest at the rate or rates determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average rate on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States as of the last day of the month preceding the advance. The Secretary shall not be required to pay interest on transfers made pursuant to the Act of February 13, 1962 (76 Stat. 8), from the capital of the &ldquo;direct loans to veterans and reserves revolving fund&rdquo; to the &ldquo;loan guaranty revolving fund&rdquo; and adjustments shall be made for payments of interest on such transfers before February 29, 1964.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In order to make advances to such revolving fund, as authorized by law to effectuate the purposes and functions authorized in section 3711 of this title, the Secretary of the Treasury may use, as a public debt transaction, the proceeds of the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 include such purposes. Such sums, together with all receipts under this section and section 3711 of this title, shall be deposited with the Treasurer of the United States, in a special deposit account, and shall be available, respectively, for disbursement for the purposes of section 3711 of this title. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall from time to time cause to be deposited into the Treasury of the United States, to the credit of miscellaneous receipts, such of the funds in such account as in the Secretary's judgment are not needed for the purposes for which they were provided, including the proceeds of the sale of any loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer from the direct loan revolving fund to the loan guaranty revolving fund established by section 3724(a) of this title such amounts as the Secretary determines are not needed in the direct loan revolving fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 30 days after the date on which the Secretary of the Treasury makes a transfer under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall submit a notice of such transfer to the appropriate committees of the Congress.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) use such qualifications in determining whether to approve an appraiser to make appraisals of the reasonable value of any property, construction, repairs, or alterations for the purposes of this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in consultation with local representatives of institutions described in clause (1) of this subsection, develop and maintain lists of appraisers who are approved under clause (2) of this subsection to make appraisals for the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary shall select appraisers from a list required by subsection (a)(3) of this section on a rotating basis to make appraisals for the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If uniform qualifications become applicable for appraisers who perform appraisals for or in connection with the Federal Government, the qualifications required by subsection (a)(1) of this section may be more stringent than such uniform qualifications, but the Secretary may use no written test in determining the qualifications of appraisers other than the test prescribed to implement such uniform qualifications.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, the appraiser shall forward an appraisal report to the Secretary for review. Upon receipt of such report, the Secretary shall determine the reasonable value of the property, construction, repairs, or alterations for purposes of this chapter, and notify the veteran of such determination.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3732. Procedure on default</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) In the event of default in the payment of any loan guaranteed under this chapter, the holder of the obligation shall notify the Secretary of such default. Upon receipt of such notice, the Secretary may, subject to subsection (c) of this section, pay to such holder the guaranty not in excess of the pro rata portion of the amount originally guaranteed. Except as provided in section 3703(e) of this title, if the Secretary makes such a payment, the Secretary shall be subrogated to the rights of the holder of the obligation to the extent of the amount paid on the guaranty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before suit or foreclosure the holder of the obligation shall notify the Secretary of the default, and within thirty days thereafter the Secretary may, at the Secretary's option, pay the holder of the obligation the unpaid balance of the obligation plus accrued interest and receive an assignment of the loan and security. Nothing in this section shall preclude any forebearance for the benefit of the veteran as may be agreed upon by the parties to the loan and approved by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may establish the date, not later than the date of judgment and decree of foreclosure or sale, upon which accrual of interest or charges shall cease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Upon receiving a notice pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) provide the veteran with information and, to the extent feasible, counseling regarding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) alternatives to foreclosure, as appropriate in light of the veteran's particular circumstances, including possible methods of curing the default, conveyance of the property to the Secretary by means of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, and the actions authorized by paragraph (2) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) what the Department of Veterans Affairs&rsquo; and the veteran's liabilities would be with respect to the loan in the event of foreclosure; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) advise the veteran regarding the availability of such counseling;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except with respect to loans made by a lender which the Secretary has determined has a demonstrated record of consistently providing timely and accurate information to veterans with respect to such matters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall, to the extent of the availability of appropriations, ensure that sufficient personnel are available to administer subparagraph (A) of this paragraph effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the event of default in the payment of any loan guaranteed or insured under this chapter in which a partial payment has been tendered by the veteran concerned and refused by the holder, the holder of the obligation shall notify the Secretary as soon as such payment has been refused. The Secretary may require that any such notification include a statement of the circumstances of the default, the amount tendered, the amount of the indebtedness on the date of the tender, and the reasons for the holder's refusal.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:459 --><p class="statutory-body">(b) With respect to any loan made under section 3711 which has not been sold as provided in subsection (g) of such section, if the Secretary finds, after there has been a default in the payment of any installment of principal or interest owing on such loan, that the default was due to the fact that the veteran who is obligated under the loan has become unemployed as the result of the closing (in whole or in part) of a Federal installation, the Secretary shall (1) extend the time for curing the default to such time as the Secretary determines is necessary and desirable to enable such veteran to complete payments on such loan, including an extension of time beyond the stated maturity thereof, or (2) modify the terms of such loan for the purpose of changing the amortization provisions thereof by recasting, over the remaining term of the loan, or over such longer period as the Secretary may determine, the total unpaid amount then due with the modification to become effective currently or upon the termination of an agreed-upon extension of the period for curing the default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;defaulted loan&rdquo; means a loan that is guaranteed under this chapter, that was made for a purpose described in section 3710(a) of this title, and that is in default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &ldquo;liquidation sale&rdquo; means a judicial sale or other disposition of real property to liquidate a defaulted loan that is secured by such property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The term &ldquo;net value&rdquo;, with respect to real property, means the amount equal to (i) the fair market value of the property, minus (ii) the total of the amounts which the Secretary estimates the Secretary would incur (if the Secretary were to acquire and dispose of the property) for property taxes, assessments, liens, property maintenance, property improvement, administration, resale (including losses sustained on the resale of the property), and other costs resulting from the acquisition and disposition of the property, excluding any amount attributed to the cost to the Government of borrowing funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Except as provided in subparagraph (D) of paragraph (10) of this subsection, the term &ldquo;total indebtedness&rdquo;, with respect to a defaulted loan, means the amount equal to the total of (i) the unpaid principal of the loan, (ii) the interest on the loan as of the date applicable under paragraph (10) of this subsection, and (iii) such reasonably necessary and proper charges (as specified in the loan instrument and permitted by regulations prescribed by the Secretary to implement this subsection) associated with liquidation of the loan, including advances for taxes, insurance, and maintenance or repair of the real property securing the loan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, this subsection applies to any case in which the holder of a defaulted loan undertakes to liquidate the loan by means of a liquidation sale.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) This subsection does not apply to a case in which the Secretary proceeds under subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Before carrying out a liquidation sale of real property securing a defaulted loan, the holder of the loan shall notify the Secretary of the proposed sale.
