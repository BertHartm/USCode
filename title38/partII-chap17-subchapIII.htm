<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1722. Determination of inability to defray necessary expenses; income thresholds</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) For the purposes of section 1710(a)(2)(G) of this title, a veteran shall be considered to be unable to defray the expenses of necessary care if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the veteran is eligible to receive medical assistance under a State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the veteran is in receipt of pension under section 1521 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the veteran's attributable income is not greater than the amount set forth in subsection (b).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) For purposes of subsection (a)(3), the income threshold for the calendar year beginning on January 1, 1990, is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) $17,240 in the case of a veteran with no dependents; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $20,688 in the case of a veteran with one dependent, plus $1,150 for each additional dependent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For a calendar year beginning after December 31, 1990, the amounts in effect for purposes of this subsection shall be the amounts in effect for the preceding calendar year as adjusted under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Effective on January 1 of each year, the amounts in effect under subsection (b) of this section shall be increased by the percentage by which the maximum rates of pension were increased under section 5312(a) of this title during the preceding calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Notwithstanding the attributable income of a veteran, the Secretary may refuse to make a determination described in paragraph (2) of this subsection if the corpus of the estate of the veteran is such that under all the circumstances it is reasonable that some part of the corpus of the estate of the veteran be consumed for the veteran's maintenance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A determination described in this paragraph is a determination that for purposes of subsection (a)(3) of this section a veteran's attributable income is not greater than the <!-- PDFPage:221 -->amount determined under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the corpus of the estate of a veteran shall be determined in the same manner as the manner in which determinations are made of the corpus of the estates of persons under section 1522 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) In order to avoid a hardship to a veteran described in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Secretary may deem the veteran to have an attributable income during the previous year not greater than the amount determined under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A veteran is described in this paragraph for the purposes of subsection (a) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the veteran has an attributable income greater than the amount determined under subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the current projections of such veteran's income for the current year are that the veteran's income for such year will be substantially below the amount determined under subsection (b).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) For purposes of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;attributable income&rdquo; means the income of a veteran for the previous year determined in the same manner as the manner in which a determination is made of the total amount of income by which the rate of pension for such veteran under section 1521 of this title would be reduced if such veteran were eligible for pension under that section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;corpus of the estate of the veteran&rdquo; includes the corpus of the estates of the veteran's spouse and dependent children, if any.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;previous year&rdquo; means the calendar year preceding the year in which the veteran applies for care or services under section 1710(a) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) For the purposes of section 1724(c) of this title, the fact that a veteran is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) eligible to receive medical assistance under a State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a veteran with a service-connected disability; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in receipt of pension under any law administered by the Secretary,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be accepted as sufficient evidence of such veteran's inability to defray necessary expenses.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) has no entitlement to care or services under a health-plan contract (determined, in the case of a health-plan contract as defined in subsection (f)(2)(B) or (f)(2)(C), without regard to any requirement or limitation relating to eligibility for care or services from any department or agency of the United States);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) has no other contractual or legal recourse against a third party that would, in whole or in part, extinguish such liability to the provider; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) is not eligible for reimbursement for medical care or services under section 1728 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Payment by the Secretary under this section on behalf of a veteran to a provider of emergency treatment shall, unless rejected and refunded by the provider within 30 days of receipt, extinguish any liability on the part of the veteran for that treatment.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any amount paid by the United States to the provider that furnished the veteran's emergency treatment shall constitute a lien against any subsequent amount the provider receives from a third party for the same emergency treatment for which the United States made payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The veteran (or the veteran's personal representative, successor, dependents, or survivors) shall ensure that the Secretary is promptly notified of any payment received from any third party for emergency treatment furnished to the veteran.

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Waiver</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, may waive recovery of a payment made to a veteran under this section that is otherwise required by subsection (d)(1) when the Secretary determines that such waiver would be in the best interest of the United States, as defined by regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this section:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection applies to a non-service-connected disability&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Subject to this section and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary under this section, the Secretary may assist a veteran by referring such veteran for placement in, and aiding such veteran in obtaining placement in, a community residential-care facility if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) at the time of initiating the assistance the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is furnishing the veteran medical services on an outpatient basis or hospital, domiciliary, or nursing home care; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has furnished the veteran such care or services within the preceding 12 months; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) placement of the veteran in a community residential-care facility is appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary may not provide assistance under subsection (a) of this section with respect to a community residential-care facility unless such facility is approved by the Secretary for the purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary's approval of a facility for the purposes of this section shall be based upon the Secretary's determination, after inspection of the facility, that the facility meets the standards established in regulations prescribed under this section. Such standards shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Health and safety criteria, including a requirement of compliance with applicable State laws and local ordinances relating to health and safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A requirement that the costs charged for care by a facility be reasonable, as determined by the Secretary, giving consideration to such factors as (i) the level of care, supervision, and other services to be provided, (ii) the cost of goods and services in the geographic area in which the facility is located, and (iii) comparability with other facilities in such area providing similar services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Criteria for determining the resources that a facility needs in order to provide an appropriate level of services to veterans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Such other criteria as the Secretary determines are appropriate to protect the welfare of veterans placed in a facility under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Payment of the charges of a community residential-care facility for any care or service provided to a veteran whom the Secretary has referred to that facility under this section is not the responsibility of the United States or of the Department.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) In order to determine continued compliance by community residential-care facilities that have been approved under subsection (b) of this section with the standards established in <!-- PDFPage:232 -->regulations prescribed under this section, the Secretary shall provide for periodic inspection of such facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary determines that a facility is not in compliance with such standards, the Secretary (in accordance with regulations prescribed under this section)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall cease to refer veterans to such facility; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may, with the permission of the veteran (or the person or entity authorized by law to give permission on behalf of the veteran), assist in removing a veteran from such facility.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Regulations prescribed to carry out this paragraph shall provide for reasonable notice and, upon request made on behalf of the facility, a hearing before any action authorized by this paragraph is taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section. Such regulations shall include the standards required by subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) To the extent possible, the Secretary shall make available each report of an inspection of a community residential-care facility under subsection (b)(2) or (c)(1) of this section to each Federal, State, and local agency charged with the responsibility of licensing or otherwise regulating or inspecting such facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall make the standards prescribed in regulations under subsection (d) of this section available to all Federal, State, and local agencies charged with the responsibility of licensing or otherwise regulating or inspecting community residential-care facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) For the purpose of this section, the term &ldquo;community residential-care facility&rdquo; means a facility that provides room and board and such limited personal care for and supervision of residents as the Secretary determines, in accordance with regulations prescribed under this section, are necessary for the health, safety, and welfare of residents.</p>
