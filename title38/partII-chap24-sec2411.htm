<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a person described in subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2), the prohibition under paragraph (1) shall not apply unless written notice of a conviction referred to in subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2), as the case may be, is received by the appropriate Federal official before such official approves an application for the interment or memorialization of such person. Such written notice shall be furnished to such official by the Attorney General, in the case of a Federal capital crime, or by an appropriate State official, in the case of a State capital crime.</p>

Any such finding may only be made based upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence, after an opportunity for a hearing in a manner prescribed by the appropriate Federal official.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;Federal capital crime&rdquo; means an offense under Federal law for which a sentence of imprisonment for life or the death penalty may be imposed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;State capital crime&rdquo; means, under State law, the willful, deliberate, or premeditated unlawful killing of another human being for which a sentence of imprisonment for life or the death penalty may be imposed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;appropriate Federal official&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary, in the case of the National Cemetery Administration; and</p>
