<p class="statutory-body">(c) Whenever the Secretary determines that any site acquired for the construction of a medical facility is not suitable for that purpose, the Secretary may exchange such site for another site to be used for that purpose or may sell such site.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Secretary may provide for the acquisition of not more than three facilities for the provision of outpatient services or nursing home care through lease-purchase arrangements on real property under the jurisdiction of the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The purpose of this subsection is to enable Congress to ensure the equitable distribution of medical facilities throughout the United States, taking into consideration the comparative urgency of the need for the services to be provided in the case of each particular facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No funds may be appropriated for any fiscal year, and the Secretary may not obligate or expend funds (other than for advance planning and design), for any major medical facility project or any major medical facility lease unless funds for that project or lease have been specifically authorized by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purpose of this subsection:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;major medical facility project&rdquo; means a project for the construction, alteration, or acquisition of a medical facility involving a total expenditure of more than $3,000,000, but such term does not include an acquisition by exchange.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &ldquo;major medical facility lease&rdquo; means a lease for space for use as a new medical facility at an average annual rental of more than $300,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In the event that the President or the Secretary proposes to the Congress the funding of any construction, alteration, lease, or other acquisition to which subsection (a) of this section is applicable, the Secretary shall submit to each committee, on the same day, a prospectus of the proposed medical facility. Such prospectus shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a detailed description of the medical facility to be constructed, altered, leased, or otherwise acquired under this subchapter, including a description of the location of such facility and, in the case of a prospectus proposing the construction of a new or replacement medical facility, a description of the consideration that was given to acquiring an existing facility by lease or purchase and to the sharing of health-care resources with the Department of Defense under section 8111 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an estimate of the cost to the United States of the construction, alteration, lease, or other acquisition of such facility (including site costs, if applicable); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an estimate of the cost to the United States of the equipment required for the operation of such facility.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Not less than 30 days before obligating funds for a major medical facility project approved by a law described in subsection (a)(2) of this section in an amount that would cause the total amount obligated for that project to exceed the amount specified in the law for that project (or would add to total obligations exceeding such specified amount) by more than 10 percent, the Secretary shall provide the committees with notice of the Secretary's intention to do so and the reasons for the specified amount being exceeded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In any case in which the Secretary proposes that funds be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which such funds were appropriated, the Secretary shall promptly notify each committee, in writing, of the particulars <!-- PDFPage:646 -->involved and the reasons why such funds were not used for the purpose for which appropriated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary may accept gifts or donations for any of the purposes of this subchapter.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that the size of the Committee shall be mutually determined by the Under Secretary for Health and the Assistant Secretary. During odd-numbered fiscal years, the Under Secretary for Health shall be the chairman of the Committee. During even-numbered fiscal years, the Assistant Secretary shall be the chairman of the Committee. The agencies shall provide administrative support services for the Committee at a level sufficient for the efficient operation of the Committee and shall share the responsibility for the provision of such services on an equitable basis.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) After considering the recommendations made under subsection (b)(4) of this section, the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense shall jointly establish guidelines to promote the sharing of health-care resources between the agencies. Guidelines established under this subsection shall provide for such sharing consistent with the health-care responsibilities of the Department under this title and with the health-care responsibilities of the Department of Defense under chapter 55 of title 10 and so as not to adversely affect the range of services, the quality of care, or the established priorities for care provided by either agency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each such agreement shall identify the health-care resources to be shared.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each such agreement shall provide, and shall specify procedures designed to ensure, that <!-- PDFPage:655 -->the availability of direct health care to individuals who are not primary beneficiaries of the providing agency (A) is on a referral basis from the facility of the other agency, and (B) does not (as determined by the head of the facility of the providing agency) adversely affect the range of services, the quality of care, or the established priorities for care provided to the primary beneficiaries of the providing agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each such agreement shall provide that a providing agency shall be reimbursed for the cost of the health-care resources provided under the agreement and that the rate for such reimbursement shall be determined in accordance with the methodology agreed to pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Reimbursement under any sharing agreement entered into under subsection (d) of this section shall be based upon a methodology that is agreed upon by the Under Secretary for Health and the Assistant Secretary and that provides appropriate flexibility to the heads of the facilities concerned to take into account local conditions and needs and the actual costs to the providing agency's facility of the health-care resources provided. Any funds received through such a reimbursement shall be credited to funds that have been allotted to the facility that provided the care or services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) At the time the President's Budget is transmitted to Congress in any year pursuant to section 1105 of title 31, the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense shall submit a joint report to Congress on the implementation of this section during the fiscal year that ended during the previous calendar year. Each such report shall include&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) During and immediately following a period of war, or a period of national emergency declared by the President or the Congress that involves the use of the Armed Forces in armed conflict, the Secretary may furnish hospital care, nursing home care, and medical services to members of the Armed Forces on active duty. The Secretary may give a higher priority to the furnishing of care and services under this section than to the furnishing of care and services to any other group of persons eligible for care and services in medical facilities of the Department with the exception of veterans with service-connected disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this section, the terms &ldquo;hospital care&rdquo;, &ldquo;nursing home care&rdquo;, and &ldquo;medical services&rdquo; have the meanings given such terms by sections 1701(5), 101(28), and 1701(6) of this title, respectively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) During a period in which the Secretary is authorized to furnish care and services to members of the Armed Forces under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary, to the extent authorized by the President and subject to the availability of appropriations or reimbursements under subsection (c) of this section, may enter into contracts with private facilities for the provision during such period by such facilities of hospital care and medical services described in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Hospital care and medical services referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) hospital care and medical services authorized under this title for a veteran and necessary for the care or treatment of a condition for which the veteran is receiving medical services at a Department facility under subsection (f) of section 1712 of this title, in a case in which the delay involved in furnishing such care or services at such Department facility or at any other Department facility reasonably accessible to the veteran would, in the judgment of the Under Secretary for Health, be likely to result in a deterioration of such condition; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) hospital care for a veteran who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is receiving hospital care under section 1710 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) is eligible for hospital care under such section and requires such care in a medical emergency that poses a serious threat to the life or health of the veteran;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">if Department facilities are not capable of furnishing or continuing to furnish the care required because of the furnishing of care and services to members of the Armed Forces under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The cost of any care or services provided by the Department under subsection (a) of this section shall be reimbursed to the Department by the Department of Defense at such rates as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense based on the cost of the care or services provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amounts received under this subsection shall be credited to funds allotted to the Department facility that provided the care or services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Defense shall jointly review plans for the implementation of this section not less often than annually.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever a modification to such plans is agreed to, the Secretaries shall jointly submit to the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives a report on such modification. Any such report shall be submitted within 30 days after the modification is agreed to.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to govern any exercise of the authority of the Secretary under subsections (a) and (b) of this section and of the Under Secretary for Health under subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Within thirty days after a declaration of a period of war or national emergency described in subsection (a) of this section (or as soon after the end of such thirty-day period as is reasonably practicable), the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives a report on the Secretary's allocation of facilities and personnel in order to provide priority hospital care, nurs<!-- PDFPage:658 -->ing home care, and medical services under this section to members of the Armed Forces. Thereafter, with respect to any fiscal year in which the authority in subsection (b) of this section to enter into contracts with private facilities has been used, the Secretary shall report within ninety days after the end of such fiscal year to those committees regarding the extent of, and the circumstances under which, such authority was used.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A transfer of real property may not be made under this paragraph unless&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the transfer is made subject to the conditions (I) that the property be used by the State for a nursing-home or domiciliary care facility in accordance with the conditions and limitations applicable to State home facilities constructed with assistance under subchapter III of chapter 81 of this title, and (II) that, if the property is used at any time for any other purpose, all right, title, and interest in and to the property shall revert to the United States.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the Secretary may not procure health-care items under local contracts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) A health-care item for use by the Department may be procured under a local contract if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the procurement is within the limits prescribed in paragraph (3) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) the item is not otherwise available to the Department medical center concerned,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) procurement of the item by a local contract is necessary for the effective furnishing of health-care services or the conduct of a research or education program at a Department medical center, as determined by the director of the center in accordance with regulations which the Under Secretary for Health shall prescribe, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) procurement under a local contract is demonstrably more cost-effective for the item.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of the need for an emergency procurement of a health-care item, such item may be procured under a local contract, but no greater quantity of such item may be procured by a local contract than is reasonably necessary to meet the emergency need and the reasonably foreseeable need for the item at the medical center concerned until resupply can be achieved through procurement actions other than emergency procurement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of this paragraph, not more than 20 percent of the total of all health-care items procured by the Department in any fiscal year (measured as a percent of the total cost of all such health-care items procured by the Department in that fiscal year) may be procured under local contracts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Local contracts for the procurement of health-care items shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be awarded to regular dealers or manufacturers engaged in the wholesale supply of such items.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary may increase for a fiscal year the percentage specified in subparagraph (A) of this section to a percentage not greater than 30 percent if the Secretary, based on the experience of the Department during the two fiscal years preceding such fiscal year, determines that the increase and the amount of the increase are necessary in the interest of the effective furnishing of health-care services by the Department. The authority to increase such percentage may not be delegated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Items procured through an emergency procurement shall not be counted for the purpose of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A provision of law that is inconsistent with subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall not apply, to the extent of the inconsistency, to the procurement of a health-care item for use by the Department.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Not later than December 1 of each year (beginning in 1992), the director of each Department medical center shall transmit to the Secretary a report containing a list indicating the quantity of each health-care item procured at that medical center under a local contract during the preceding fiscal year and the total amount paid for such item during such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than February 1 of each year (beginning in 1993), the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and the House of Representatives a report on the experience in carrying out this section during the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Not later than February 1 of each year from 1989 through 1992, the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and the House of Representatives a report on the experience in carrying out this section during the preceding fiscal year. The first such report shall contain information showing the percentage (measured by cost) of the total of all health-care items procured by the Department during fiscal year 1988 that were procured through local contracts. The other reports under this paragraph shall contain information showing the percentage (measured by cost) of the total of all health-care items procured by the Department, and by each Department medical center, during the fiscal year covered by the report that were purchased through local contracts and, in the case of each medical center at which the percentage was greater than 20 percent, an explanation of the reasons why that occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) For the purposes of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;health-care item&rdquo; includes any item listed in, or (as determined by the Secretary) of the same nature as an item listed in, Federal Supply Classification (FSC) Group 65 or 66. Effective December 1, 1992, such term also includes any item listed in, or (as determined by the Secretary) of the same nature as an item listed in, Federal Supply Classification (FSC) Group 73. Such term does not include perishable items.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;local contract&rdquo; means a contract entered into by a Department medical center for procurement of an item for use by that medical center.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;emergency procurement&rdquo; means a procurement necessary to meet an emergency need, affecting the health or safety <!-- PDFPage:664 -->of a person being furnished health-care services by the Department, for an item.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Any State desiring to receive assistance for a project for construction of State home facilities (or acquisition of a facility to be used as a State home facility) must submit to the Secretary an application. Such application shall set forth&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount of the grant requested with respect to such project which may not exceed 65 percent of the estimated cost of construction (or of the estimated cost of facility acquisition and construction) of such project,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a description of the site for such project,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) reasonable assurance that upon completion of such project the facilities will be used principally to furnish to veterans the level of care for which such application is made and that not more than 25 percent of the bed occupancy at any one time will consist of patients who are not receiving such level of care as veterans,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) reasonable assurance that title to such site is or will be vested solely in the applicant, a State home, or another agency or instrumentality of the State,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) reasonable assurance that adequate financial support will be available for the construction of the project (or for facility acquisition and construction of the project) by July 1 of the fiscal year for which the application is approved and for its maintenance and operation when complete,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) reasonable assurance that the State will make such reports in such form and containing such information as the Secretary may from time to time reasonably require, and give the Secretary, upon demand, access to the records upon which such information is based,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) reasonable assurance that the rates of pay for laborers and mechanics engaged in construction of the project will be not less than the prevailing local wage rates for similar work as determined in accordance with the Act of March 3, 1931 (40 U.S.C. 276a&mdash;276a&ndash;5) (known as the Davis-Bacon Act), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) in the case of a project for acquisition of a facility, reasonable assurance that the estimated total cost of acquisition of the facility and of any expansion, remodeling, and alteration of the acquired facility will not be greater than the estimated cost of construction of an equivalent new facility.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Upon receipt of an application for a grant under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall determine whether the application meets the requirements of this section and of the regulations prescribed under section 8134 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall notify the State submitting the application whether the application conforms with those requirements and, if it does not, of the actions necessary to bring the application into conformance with those requirements; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:670 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall determine the priority of the project described in the application in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to paragraphs (3) and (5)(C) of this subsection, the Secretary shall accord priority to applications in the following order:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) An application from a State that has made sufficient funds available for the construction or acquisition of the project for which the grant is requested so that such project may proceed upon approval of the grant without further action required by the State to make such funds available for such purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) An application from a State that does not have a State home facility constructed or acquired with assistance under this subchapter (or for which such a grant has been made).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) An application from a State which the Secretary determines, in accordance with criteria and procedures specified in regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, has a greater need for nursing home or domiciliary beds than other States from which applications are received.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) An application that meets such other criteria as the Secretary determines are appropriate and has established in regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In according priorities to projects under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall accord priority only to projects which would involve construction or acquisition of either nursing home or domiciliary buildings; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may not accord any priority to a project which would expand a State's capacity to furnish hospital care in a State home.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall establish a list of approved projects (including projects that have been conditionally approved under paragraph (6) of this subsection), in the order of their priority, as of August 15 of each year. The Secretary shall award grants in the order of their priority on the list during the fiscal year beginning on October 1 of the calendar year in which the list was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The Secretary shall defer approval of an application that otherwise meets the requirements of this section if the State submitting the application does not, by the July 1 deadline (as defined in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph), demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the State has provided adequate financial support for construction of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In a case in which approval of an application is deferred under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall select for award of a grant or grants under this subsection an application or applications which would not have been approved during the fiscal year but for the deferral and to which the Secretary accords the highest priority under paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) An application deferred in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph shall be accorded priority in any subsequent fiscal year ahead of applications that had not been approved before the first day of the fiscal year in which the deferred application was first approved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For the purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;July 1 deadline&rdquo; means July 1 of the fiscal year in which the State is notified by the Secretary of the availability of funding for a grant for such project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) The Secretary may conditionally approve a project under this section, conditionally award a grant for the project, and obligate funds for the grant if the Secretary determines that the application for the grant is sufficiently complete to warrant awarding the grant and that, based on assurances provided by the State submitting the application, the State will complete the application and meet all the requirements referred to in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection by the date, not later than 180 days after the date of the conditional approval, specified by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If a State does not complete the application and meet all the requirements referred to in such paragraph by the date specified by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall rescind the conditional approval and award under such subparagraph and deobligate the funds previously obligated in connection with the application. In the event the Secretary rescinds conditional approval of a project under this subparagraph, the Secretary may not further obligate funds for the project during the fiscal year in which the Secretary rescinds such approval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the Secretary may increase the amount of any grant awarded to any State for a project under this section by an amount by which the Secretary determines that the estimated cost of the construction or acquisition has increased from the estimated cost on which the Secretary based the determination to award the grant, without regard to the position of such project on the list established under paragraph (4) of this subsection, if the Secretary determines that the grant was awarded before the State entered into a contract for the construction or acquisition provided for in such project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A grant may not be increased under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph by more than 10 percent of the amount of the grant initially awarded for such project, and the amount of such grant, as increased, may not exceed 65 percent of the cost of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) No application submitted to the Secretary under this section shall be disapproved until the Secretary has afforded the applicant notice and an opportunity for a hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The amount of a grant under this subchapter shall be paid to the applicant or, if designated by the applicant, the State home for which such project is being carried out or any other agency or instrumentality of the applicant. Such amount shall be paid, in advance or by way of reimbursement, and in such installments consistent with the progress of the project as the Secretary may determine and certify for payment to the Secretary of the Treasury. Funds paid under this section for an approved project shall be used solely for carrying out such project as so approved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Any amendment of any application, whether or not approved, shall be subject to approval in the same manner as an original application.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to improve the quality of hospital care and other medical service provided veterans under this title, by authorizing the Secretary to enter into agreements with medical schools, health-care facilities, and research centers throughout the country in order to receive from and share with such medical schools, health-care facilities, and research centers the most advanced medical techniques and information, as well as certain specialized medical resources which otherwise might not be feasibly available or to effectively utilize other medical resources with the surrounding medical community, without diminution of services to veterans. Among other things, it is intended, by these means, to strengthen the medical programs at those Department hospitals which are located in small cities or rural areas and thus are remote from major medical centers. It is further the purpose of this subchapter to improve the provision of care to veterans under this title by authorizing the Secretary to enter into agreements with State veterans facilities for the sharing of health-care resources.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) To secure certain specialized medical resources which otherwise might not be feasibly available, or to effectively utilize certain other medical resources, the Secretary may, when the Secretary determines it to be in the best interest of the prevailing standards of the Department medical care program, make arrangements, by contract or other form of agreement for the mutual use, or exchange of use, of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specialized medical resources between Department health-care facilities and other health-care facilities (including organ banks, blood banks, or similar institutions), research centers, or medical schools; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) health-care resources between Department health-care facilities and State home facilities recognized under section 1742(a) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may enter into a contract or other agreement under paragraph (1) only if (A) such an agreement will obviate the need for a similar resource to be provided in a Department health care facility, or (B) the Department resources which are the subject of the agreement and which have been justified on the basis of veterans&rsquo; care are not used to their maximum effective capacity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Arrangements entered into under this section shall provide for reciprocal reimbursement based on a methodology that provides appropriate flexibility to the heads of the facilities concerned to establish an appropriate reimbursement rate after taking into account local conditions and needs and the actual costs to the providing facility of the resource involved. Any proceeds to the Government received therefrom shall be credited to the applicable Department medical appropriation and to funds that have been allotted to the facility that furnished the resource involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Eligibility for hospital care and medical services furnished any veteran pursuant to this section shall be subject to the same terms as though provided in a Department health care facility, and provisions of this title applicable to persons receiving hospital care or medical services in a Department health care facility shall apply to veterans treated under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When a Department health care facility provides hospital care or medical services, pursuant to a contract or agreement authorized by this section, to an individual who is not eligible for such care or services under chapter 17 of this title and who is entitled to hospital or medical insurance benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.), such benefits shall be paid, notwithstanding any condition, limitation, or other provision in that title which would otherwise preclude such payment, in accordance with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) rates prescribed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, after consultation with the Secretary, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) procedures jointly prescribed by the two Secretaries to assure reasonable quality of care and services and efficient and economical utilization of resources,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">to such facility therefor or, if the contract or agreement so provides, to the community health care facility which is a party to the contract or agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary shall submit to the Congress not more than 60 days after the end of each fiscal year a report on the activities carried out under this section. Each report shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an appraisal of the effectiveness of the activities authorized in this section and the degree of cooperation from other sources, financial and otherwise; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) recommendations for the improvement or more effective administration of such activities.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary is authorized to enter into agreements with medical schools, hospitals, research centers, and individual members of the medical profession under which medical information and techniques will be freely exchanged and the medical information services of all parties to the agreement will be available for use by any party to the agreement under conditions specified in the agreement. In carrying out the purposes of this section, the Secretary shall utilize recent developments in electronic equipment to provide a close educational, scientific, and professional link between Department hospitals and major medical centers. Such agreements shall be utilized by the Secretary to the maximum extent practicable to create, at each Department hospital which is a part of any such agreement, an environment of academic medicine which will help such hospital attract and retain highly trained and qualified members of the medical profession.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In order to bring about utilization of all medical information in the surrounding medical community, particularly in remote areas, and to foster and encourage the widest possible cooperation and consultation among all members of the medical profession in such community, the educational facilities and programs established at Department hospitals and the electronic link to medical centers shall be made available for use by the surrounding medical community (including State home facilities furnishing domiciliary, nursing home, or hospital care to veterans). The Secretary may charge a fee for such services (on annual or like basis) at rates which the Secretary determines, after appropriate study, to be fair and equitable. The financial status of any user of such services shall be taken into consideration by the Secretary in establishing the amount of the fee to be paid. Any proceeds to the Government received therefrom shall be credited to the applicable Department medical appropriation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary is authorized to enter into agreements with public and nonprofit private institutions, organizations, corporations, and other entities in order to participate in cooperative health-care personnel education programs within the geographical area of any Department health-care facility located in an area remote from major academic health centers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) In carrying out the purposes of this chapter, the Secretary may lease to any eligible institution for such consideration and under such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate, such land, buildings, and structures (including equipment therein) under the control and jurisdiction of the Department as may be necessary. The three-year limitation on the term of a lease prescribed in section 8122(a) of this title shall not apply with respect to any lease entered into pursuant to this chapter, but no such lease may be for a period of more than 50 years. Any lease entered into pursuant to this chapter may be entered into without regard to the provisions of section 3709 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5). Notwithstanding section 321 of the Act of June 30, 1932 (40 U.S.C. 303b), or any other provision of law, a lease entered into pursuant to this chapter may provide for the maintenance, protection, or restoration, by the lessee, of the property leased, as a part or all of the consideration of the lease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) In making grants under this chapter, the Secretary shall give special consideration to applications from institutions which provide reasonable assurances, which shall be included in the grant agreement, that priority for admission to health manpower and training programs carried out by such institutions will be given to otherwise qualified veterans who during their military service acquired medical military occupation specialties, and that among such qualified veterans those who served during the Vietnam era and those who are entitled to disability compensation under laws administered by the Secretary or whose discharge or release was for a disability incurred or aggravated in line of duty will be given the highest priority. In carrying out this chapter and section 7302 of this title in connection with health manpower and training programs assisted or conducted under this title or in affiliation with a Department medical facility, the Secretary shall take appropriate steps to encourage the institutions involved to afford the priorities described in the first sentence of this subsection and to advise all qualified veterans with such medical military occu<!-- PDFPage:682 -->pation specialties of the steps the Secretary has taken under this subsection and the opportunities available to them as a result of such steps.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Each recipient of assistance under this chapter shall keep such records as the Secretary shall prescribe, including records which fully disclose the amount and disposition by such recipient of the proceeds of such assistance, the total cost of the project or undertaking in connection with which such assistance is made or used, the amount of that portion of the cost of the project or undertaking supplied by other sources, and such records as will facilitate an effective audit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access for the purpose of audit and examination to any books, documents, papers, and records of the recipient of any assistance under this chapter which are pertinent to such assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Not later than ninety days after the end of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a report on activities carried out under this chapter, including (1) an appraisal of the effectiveness of the programs authorized herein in carrying out their statutory purposes and the degree of cooperation from other sources, financial and otherwise, (2) an appraisal of the contributions of such programs in improving the quantity and quality of physicians and other health care personnel furnishing hospital care and medical services to veterans under this title, (3) a list of the approved but unfunded projects under this chapter and the funds needed for each such project, and (4) recommendations for the improvement or more effective administration of such programs, including any necessary legislation.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 8501 of this title, the Secretary may dispose of the personal property of such decedent left or found upon such premises as hereafter provided in this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If any veteran (admitted as a veteran), or a dependent or survivor of a veteran receiving care under the last sentence of section 1713(b) of this title, upon such person's last admission to, or during such person's last period of maintenance in, a Department facility, has personal property situated on such facility and shall have designated in writing a person (natural or corporate) to receive such property when such veteran, dependent or survivor dies, the Secretary or employee of the Department authorized by the Secretary so to act, may transfer possession of such personal property to the person so designated. If there exists no person so designated by such veteran, dependent, or survivor or if the one so designated declines to receive such property, or failed to request such property within ninety days after the Department mails to such designate a notice of death and of the fact of such designation, a description of the property, and an estimate of transportation cost, which shall be paid by such designate if required under the regulations hereinafter mentioned, or if the Secretary declines to transfer possession to such designate, possession of such property may in the discretion of the Secretary or the Secretary's designated subordinate, be transferred to the following persons in the order and manner herein specified unless the parties otherwise agree in writing delivered to the Department, namely, executor or administrator, or if no notice of appointment received, to the spouse, children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, siblings of the veteran. If claim is made by two or more such relatives having equal priorities, as hereinabove prescribed, or if there are conflicting claims the Secretary or the Secretary's designee may in such case deliver the property either jointly or separately in equal values, to those equally entitled thereto or may make delivery as may be agreed upon by those entitled, or may in the discretion of the Secretary or the Secretary's designee withhold delivery from them and require the qualification of an administrator or executor of the veterans&rsquo; estate and thereupon make delivery to such.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If the property of any decedent is not so delivered or claimed and accepted the Secretary or the Secretary's designee may dispose of such <!-- PDFPage:690 -->property by public or private sale in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter and regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) All sales authorized by this subchapter shall be for cash upon delivery at the premises where sold and without warranty, express or implied. The proceeds of such sales after payment of any expenses incident thereto as may be prescribed by regulations, together with any other moneys left or found on a facility, not disposed of in accordance with this subchapter, shall be credited to the General Post Fund, National Homes, Department of Veterans Affairs, a trust fund provided for in section 1321(a)(45) of title 31. In addition to the purposes for which such fund may be used under the existing law, disbursements may be made therefrom as authorized by the Secretary by regulation or otherwise for the purpose of satisfying any legal liability incurred by any employee in administering the provisions of this subchapter, including any expense incurred in connection therewith. Legal liability shall not exist when delivery or sale shall have been made in accordance with this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If, notwithstanding such sale, a claim is filed with the Secretary within five years after notice of sale as herein required, by or on behalf of any person or persons who if known would have been entitled to the property under section 8501 of this title or to possession thereof under this section, the Secretary shall determine the person or persons entitled under the provisions of this subchapter and may pay to such person or persons so entitled the proceeds of sale of such property, less expenses. Such payment shall be made out of the said trust fund, and in accord with the provisions of this section or section 8501 of this title. Persons under legal disability to sue in their own name may make claim for the proceeds of sale of such property at any time within five years after termination of such legal disability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Any such property, the sale of which is authorized under this subchapter and which remains unsold, may be used, destroyed, or otherwise disposed of in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary.</p>
