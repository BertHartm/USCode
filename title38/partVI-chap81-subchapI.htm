<p class="statutory-body">(b) Whenever the Secretary considers it to be in the interest of the United States to construct a new medical facility to replace an existing medical facility, the Secretary (1) may demolish the existing facility and use the site on which it is located for the site of the new medical facility, or (2) if in the judgment of the Secretary it is more advantageous to construct such medical facility on a different site in the same locality, may exchange such existing facility and the site of such existing facility for the different site.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Whenever the Secretary determines that any site acquired for the construction of a medical facility is not suitable for that purpose, the Secretary may exchange such site for another site to be used for that purpose or may sell such site.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Secretary may sublease any space in such a facility to another party at a rate not less than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the rental rate paid by the Secretary for such space under paragraph (3) of this subsection; plus</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The purpose of this subsection is to enable Congress to ensure the equitable distribution of medical facilities throughout the United States, taking into consideration the comparative urgency of the need for the services to be provided in the case of each particular facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No funds may be appropriated for any fiscal year, and the Secretary may not obligate or expend funds (other than for advance planning and design), for any major medical facility project or any major medical facility lease unless funds for that project or lease have been specifically authorized by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purpose of this subsection:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;major medical facility project&rdquo; means a project for the construction, alteration, or acquisition of a medical facility involving a total expenditure of more than $3,000,000, but such term does not include an acquisition by exchange.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &ldquo;major medical facility lease&rdquo; means a lease for space for use as a new medical facility at an average annual rental of more than $300,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In the event that the President or the Secretary proposes to the Congress the funding of any construction, alteration, lease, or other acquisition to which subsection (a) of this section is applicable, the Secretary shall submit to each committee, on the same day, a prospectus of the proposed medical facility. Such prospectus shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a detailed description of the medical facility to be constructed, altered, leased, or otherwise acquired under this subchapter, including a description of the location of such facility and, in the case of a prospectus proposing the construction of a new or replacement medical facility, a description of the consideration that was given to acquiring an existing facility by lease or purchase and to the sharing of health-care resources with the Department of Defense under section 8111 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an estimate of the cost to the United States of the construction, alteration, lease, or other acquisition of such facility (including site costs, if applicable); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an estimate of the cost to the United States of the equipment required for the operation of such facility.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Not less than 30 days before obligating funds for a major medical facility project approved by a law described in subsection (a)(2) of this section in an amount that would cause the total amount obligated for that project to exceed the amount specified in the law for that project (or would add to total obligations exceeding such specified amount) by more than 10 percent, the Secretary shall provide the committees with notice of the Secretary's intention to do so and the reasons for the specified amount being exceeded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In any case in which the Secretary proposes that funds be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which such funds were appropriated, the Secretary shall promptly notify each committee, in writing, of the particulars <!-- PDFPage:646 -->involved and the reasons why such funds were not used for the purpose for which appropriated.</p>

Of the number of beds authorized pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall operate and maintain a total of not less than 90,000 hospital beds and nursing home beds and shall maintain the availability of such additional beds and facilities in addition to the operating bed level as the Secretary considers necessary for such contingency purposes. The President shall include in the Budget transmitted to the Congress for each fiscal year pursuant to section 1105 of title 31, an amount for medical care and amounts for construction sufficient to enable the Department to operate and maintain a total of not less than 90,000 hospital and nursing home beds in accordance with this paragraph and to maintain the availability of the contingency capacity referred to in the second sentence of this paragraph. The Secretary shall staff and maintain, in such a manner as to ensure the immediate acceptance and timely and complete care of patients, sufficient beds and other treatment capacities to accommodate, and provide such care to, eligible veterans applying for admission and found to be in need of hospital care or medical services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall maintain the bed and treatment capacities of all Department medical facilities so as to ensure the accessibility and availability of such beds and treatment capacities to eligible veterans in all States and to minimize delays in admissions and in the provision of hospital, nursing home, and domiciliary care, and of medical services furnished pursuant to section 1712 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Under Secretary for Health shall at the end of each fiscal year (i) analyze agencywide admission policies and the records of those eligible veterans who apply for hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care, but are rejected or not immediately admitted or provided such care or services, and (ii) review and make recommendations regarding the adequacy of the established operating bed levels, the geographic distribution of operating beds, the demographic characteristics of the veteran population and the associated need for medical care and nursing home facilities and services in each State, and the proportion of the total number of operating beds that are hospital beds and that are nursing home beds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) After considering the analyses and recommendations of the Under Secretary for Health pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall report to the committees, on or before December 1 after the close of such fiscal year, on the results of the analysis of the Under Secretary for Health and on the numbers of operating beds and level of treatment capacities required to enable the Department to carry out the primary function of the Veterans Health Administration.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of an activity determined by the Under Secretary for Health under clause (A) of this paragraph to be neither such activity, the Secretary, after considering the advice of the Under Secretary for Health and the results of a study described in paragraph (4) of this subsection, may, in the exercise of the Secretary's sole discretion but subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, enter into a contract as a result of which the activity would be converted from an activity performed by Federal employees to an activity performed by employees of a contractor of the Government.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each such agreement shall identify the health-care resources to be shared.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this section, the terms &ldquo;hospital care&rdquo;, &ldquo;nursing home care&rdquo;, and &ldquo;medical services&rdquo; have the meanings given such terms by sections 1701(5), 101(28), and 1701(6) of this title, respectively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) During a period in which the Secretary is authorized to furnish care and services to members of the Armed Forces under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary, to the extent authorized by the President and subject to the availability of appropriations or reimbursements under subsection (c) of this section, may enter into contracts with private facilities for the provision during such period by such facilities of hospital care and medical services described in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Hospital care and medical services referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) hospital care and medical services authorized under this title for a veteran and necessary for the care or treatment of a condition for which the veteran is receiving medical services at a Department facility under subsection (f) of section 1712 of this title, in a case in which the delay involved in furnishing such care or services at such Department facility or at any other Department facility reasonably accessible to the veteran would, in the judgment of the Under Secretary for Health, be likely to result in a deterioration of such condition; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The cost of any care or services provided by the Department under subsection (a) of this section shall be reimbursed to the Department by the Department of Defense at such rates as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense based on the cost of the care or services provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amounts received under this subsection shall be credited to funds allotted to the Department facility that provided the care or services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Defense shall jointly review plans for the implementation of this section not less often than annually.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever a modification to such plans is agreed to, the Secretaries shall jointly submit to the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives a report on such modification. Any such report shall be submitted within 30 days after the modification is agreed to.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to govern any exercise of the authority of the Secretary under subsections (a) and (b) of this section and of the Under Secretary for Health under subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Within thirty days after a declaration of a period of war or national emergency described in subsection (a) of this section (or as soon after the end of such thirty-day period as is reasonably practicable), the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives a report on the Secretary's allocation of facilities and personnel in order to provide priority hospital care, nurs<!-- PDFPage:658 -->ing home care, and medical services under this section to members of the Armed Forces.
