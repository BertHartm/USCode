<p class="statutory-body">(c) If a person eligible for insurance under this subchapter is not so insured, or is insured for less than the maximum amount provided for the person under subparagraph (A) of subsection (a)(3), by reason of an election made by a member under subparagraph (B) of that subsection, the person may thereafter be insured under this subchapter in the maximum amount or any lesser amount elected as provided in such subparagraph (B) upon written application by the member, proof of good health of each person (other than a child) to be so insured, and compliance with such other terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary.

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Whenever a member has the opportunity to make an election under subsection (a) not to be insured under this subchapter, or to be insured under this subchapter in an amount less than the maximum amount in effect under paragraph (3)(A)(i) of that subsection, and at such other times periodically thereafter as the Secretary concerned considers appropriate, the Secretary concerned shall furnish to the member general information concerning life insurance.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the purpose and role of life insurance in financial planning;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the difference between term life insurance and whole life insurance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the availability of commercial life insurance; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) The effective date and time for any change in benefits under the Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance Program shall be based on the date and time according to the time zone immediately west of the International Date Line.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) If a member who is married and who is eligible for insurance under this section makes an election under subsection (a)(2)(A) not to be insured under this subchapter, the Secretary concerned shall notify the member's spouse, in writing, of that election.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a member who is married and who is insured under this section and whose spouse is designated as a beneficiary of the member under this subchapter, whenever the member makes an election under subsection (a)(3)(B) for insurance of the member in an amount that is less than the maximum amount provided under subsection (a)(3)(A)(i), the Secretary concerned shall notify the member's spouse, in writing, of that election&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of the first such election; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of any subsequent such election if the effect of such election is to reduce the amount of insurance coverage of the member from that in effect immediately before such election.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of a member who is married and who is insured under this section, if the member <!-- PDFPage:331 -->makes a designation under section 1970(a) of this title of any person other than the spouse or a child of the member as the beneficiary of the member for any amount of insurance under this subchapter, the Secretary concerned shall notify the member's spouse, in writing, that such a beneficiary designation has been made by the member, except that such a notification is not required if the spouse has previously received such a notification under this paragraph and if immediately before the new designation by the member under section 1970(a) of this title the spouse is not a designated beneficiary of the member for any amount of insurance under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A notification required by this subsection is satisfied by a good faith effort to provide the required information to the spouse at the last address of the spouse in the records of the Secretary concerned. Failure to provide a notification required under this subsection in a timely manner does not affect the validity of any election specified in paragraph (1) or (2) or beneficiary designation specified in paragraph (3).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) During any month in which a member is assigned to the Ready Reserve of a uniformed service under conditions which meet the qualifications of (subparagraph (B) or (C) of section 1965(5) of this title, and is insured under a policy of insurance purchased by the Secretary, under section 1966 of this title, there shall be contributed from the appropriation made for active duty pay of the uniformed service concerned an amount determined by the Secretary (which shall be the same for all such members) as the share of the cost attributable to insuring such member under this policy, less any costs traceable to the extra hazards of such duty in the uniformed services. Any amounts so contributed on behalf of any individual shall be collected by the Secretary concerned from such individual (by deduction from pay or otherwise) and shall be credited to the appropriation from which such contribution was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If an individual who is required pursuant to subparagraph (A) to make a direct remittance of costs to the Secretary concerned fails to make the required remittance within 60 days of the date on which such remittance is due, such individual's insurance with respect to which such remittance is required shall be terminated by the Secretary concerned. Such termination shall be made by written notice to the individual's official address and shall be effective 60 days after the date of such notice. Such termination of insurance may be vacated if, before the effective date of termination, the individual remits all amounts past due for such insurance and demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary concerned that the failure to make timely remittances was justifiable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) During any fiscal year, or portion thereof, that a member is on active duty or active duty for training under a call or order to such duty that specifies a period of less than thirty-one days, or is authorized or required to perform inactive duty training scheduled in advance by competent authority, and is insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance, the Secretary concerned shall collect from the member (by deduction from pay or otherwise) an amount determined by the Secretary (which shall be the same for all such members) as the share of the cost attributable to insuring such member under such policy, less any costs traceable to the extra hazard of such duty in the uniformed service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any amount not deducted from the basic or other pay of a member insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance, or collected from the member by the Secretary concerned, if not otherwise paid, shall be deducted from the proceeds of any insurance thereafter payable. The initial monthly amount under paragraph (1) or (2) hereof, or fiscal year amount under paragraph (3) hereof, determined by the Secretary to be charged under this section for Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance may be continued from year to year, except that the Secretary may redetermine such monthly or fiscal year amounts from time to time in accordance with experience. No refunds will be made to any member of any amount properly deducted from the member's basic or other pay, or collected from the member by the Secretary concerned, to cover the insurance granted under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) For each month for which any member is so insured, there shall be contributed from the appropriation made for active duty pay of the uniformed service concerned an amount determined by the Secretary and certified to the Secretary concerned to be the cost of Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance which is traceable to the extra hazard of duty in the uniformed services. Effective January 1, 1970, such cost shall be determined by the Secretary on the basis of the excess mortality incurred by members and former members of the uniformed services insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance above what their mortality would have been under peacetime conditions as such mortality is determined by the Secretary using such methods and data as the Secretary shall determine to be reasonable and practicable. The Secretary is authorized to make such adjustments regarding contributions from pay appropriations as may be indicated from actual experience.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) An amount equal to the first amount due on Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance may be advanced from current appropriations for active-service pay to any such member, which amount shall constitute a lien upon any service or other pay accruing to the person from whom such advance was made and shall be collected therefrom if not otherwise paid. No disbursing or certifying officer shall be responsible for any loss incurred by reason of such advance.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:339 --><p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The sums withheld from the basic or other pay of members, or collected from them by the Secretary concerned, under subsection (a) of this section, and the sums contributed from appropriations under subsection (b) of this section, together with the income derived from any dividends or premium rate adjustments received from insurers shall be deposited to the credit of a revolving fund established in the Treasury of the United States. All premium payments and extra hazard costs on Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance and the administrative cost to the Department of insurance issued under this subchapter shall be paid from the revolving fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary is authorized to set aside out of the revolving fund such amounts as may be required to meet the administrative costs to the Department of insurance issued under this subchapter and all current premium payments and extra hazard costs on any insurance policy or policies purchased under section 1966 of this title. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to invest in and to sell and retire special interest-bearing obligations of the United States for the account of the revolving fund. Such obligations issued for this purpose shall have maturities fixed with due regard for the needs of the fund and shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average market yield (computed by the Secretary of the Treasury on the basis of market quotations as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of issue) on all marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt which are not due or callable until after the expiration of four years from the end of such calendar month; except that where such average market yield is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest of such obligation shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum nearest such market yield.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1982 of this title, the Secretary shall, from time to time, determine the administrative costs to the Department which in the Secretary's judgment are properly allocable to insurance issued under this subchapter and shall transfer such cost from the revolving fund to the appropriation &ldquo;General Operating Expenses, Department of Veterans Affairs&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations for the administration of the functions of the Secretaries of the military departments under this section. Such regulations shall prescribe such procedures as the Secretary of Defense, after consultation with the Secretary, may consider necessary to ensure that such functions are carried out in a timely and complete manner and in accordance with the provisions of this section, including specifically the provisions of subsection (a)(2) of this section relating to contributions from appropriations made for active duty pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) No tax, fee, or other monetary payment may be imposed or collected by any State, or by any political subdivision or other governmental authority of a State, on or with respect to any premium paid under an insurance policy purchased under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be construed to exempt any company issuing a policy of insurance under this subchapter from the imposition, payment, or collection of a tax, fee, or other monetary payment on the net income or profit accruing to or realized by that company from business conducted under this subchapter, if that tax, fee, or payment is applicable to a broad range of business activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1)(A) During any period in which a spouse of a member is insured under this subchapter and the member is on active duty, there shall be deducted each month from the member's basic or other pay until separation or release from active duty an amount determined by the Secretary as the premium allocable to the pay period for providing that insurance coverage. No premium may be charged for providing insurance coverage for a child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) During any month in which a member is assigned to the Ready Reserve of a uniformed service under conditions which meet the qualifications set forth in subparagraph (B) or (C) of section 1965(5) of this title and the spouse of the member is insured under a policy of insurance purchased by the Secretary under section 1966 of this title, there shall be contributed from the appropriation made for active duty pay of the uniformed service concerned an amount determined by the Secretary as the share of the cost attributable to insuring the spouse of such member under this policy, less any costs traceable to the extra hazards of such duty in the uniformed services. Any amounts so contributed on behalf of any individual shall be collected by the Secretary concerned from such individual (by deduction from pay or otherwise) and shall be credited to the appropriation from which such contribution was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary shall determine the premium amounts to be charged for life insurance coverage for spouses of members under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The premium amounts shall be determined on the basis of sound actuarial principles and shall include an amount necessary to cover the administrative costs to the insurer or insurers providing such insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Each premium rate for the first policy year shall be continued for subsequent policy years, except that the rate may be adjusted for any such subsequent policy year on the basis of the experience under the policy, as determined by the Secretary in advance of that policy year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Any overpayment of a premium for insurance coverage for an insurable dependent of a member that is terminated under section 1968(a)(5) of this title shall be refunded to the member.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Any amount of insurance under this subchapter in force on any member or former member on the date of the insured's death shall be paid, upon the establishment of a valid claim therefor, to the person or persons surviving at the date of the insured's death, in the following order of precedence:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">First, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries as the member or former member may have designated by a writing received prior to death (1) in the uniformed services if insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance, or (2) in the administrative office established under section 1966(b) of this title if separated or released from service, or if assigned to the Retired Reserve, and insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance, or if insured under Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Second, if there be no such beneficiary, to the widow or widower of such member or former member;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Third, if none of the above, to the child or children of such member or former member and descendants of deceased children by representation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Fourth, if none of the above, to the parents of such member or former member or the survivor of them;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Fifth, if none of the above, to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of such member or former member;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Sixth, if none of the above, to other next of kin of such member or former member entitled under the laws of domicile of such member or former member at the time of the insured's death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If any person otherwise entitled to payment under this section does not make claim therefor within one year after the death of the member or former member, or if payment to such person within that period is prohibited by Federal statute or regulation, payment may be made in the order of precedence as if such person had predeceased the member or former member, and any such payment shall be a bar to recovery by any other person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If, within two years after the death of the member or former member, no claim for payment has been filed by any person entitled under the order of precedence set forth in this section, and neither the Secretary nor the administrative office established by the insurance company or companies pursuant to section 1966(b) of this title has received any notice that any such claim will be made, payment may be made to a claimant as may in the judgment of the Secretary be equitably entitled thereto, and such payment shall be a bar to recovery by any other person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The member may elect settlement of insurance under this subchapter either in a lump sum or in thirty-six equal monthly installments. If no such election is made by the member the beneficiary or beneficiaries may elect settlement either in a lump sum or in thirty-six equal monthly installments. If the member has elected settlement in a lump sum, the beneficiary or beneficiaries may elect settlement in thirty-six equal monthly installments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Until and unless otherwise changed, a beneficiary designation and settlement option filed by a member with the member's uniformed service under prior provisions of law will be effective <!-- PDFPage:342 -->with respect to the increased insurance authorized under the Veterans&rsquo; Insurance Act of 1974 and the insurance shall be settled in the same proportionate amount as the portion designated for such beneficiary or beneficiaries bore to the amount of insurance heretofore in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, payment of matured Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance or Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance benefits may be made directly to a minor widow or widower on his or her own behalf, and payment in such case shall be a complete acquittance to the insurer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Any payments due or to become due under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance or Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance made to, or on account of, an insured or a beneficiary shall be exempt from taxation, shall be exempt from the claims of creditors, and shall not be liable to attachment, levy, or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatever, either before or after receipt by the beneficiary. The preceding sentence shall not apply to (1) collection of amounts not deducted from the member's pay, or collected from him by the Secretary concerned under section 1969(a) of this title, (2) levy under subchapter D of chapter 64 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6331 et seq.) (relating to the seizure of property for collection of taxes), and (3) the taxation of any property purchased in part or wholly out of such payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Insurance payable under this subchapter may not be paid in any amount to the extent that such amount would escheat to a State. Payment of insurance under this subchapter may not be made to the estate of the insured or the estate of any beneficiary of the insured unless it is affirmatively shown that any amount to be paid will not escheat to a State. Any amount to be paid under this subchapter shall be reduced to the extent necessary to comply with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Any amount of insurance in force on an insurable dependent of a member under this subchapter on the date of the dependent's death shall be paid, upon the establishment of a valid claim therefor, to the member or, in the event of the member's death before payment to the member can be made, then to the person or persons entitled to receive payment of the proceeds of insurance on the member's life under this subchapter.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1971. Basic tables of premiums; readjustment of rates</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Each policy or policies purchased under section 1966 of this title shall include for the first policy year a schedule of basic premium rates by age which the Secretary shall have determined on a basis consistent with the lowest schedule of basic premium rates generally charged for new group life insurance policies issued to large employers, this schedule of basic premium rates by age to be applied, except as otherwise provided in this section, to the distribution by age of the amount of group life insurance under the policy at its date of issue to determine an average basic premium per $1,000 of insurance. Each policy so purchased shall also include provisions whereby the basic rates of premium determined for the first policy year shall be continued for subsequent policy years, except that they may be readjusted for any subsequent year, based on the experience under the policy, such readjustment to be made by the insurance company or companies issuing the policy on a basis determined by the Secretary in advance of such year to be consistent with the general practice of life insurance companies under policies of group life insurance issued to large employers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The total premiums for Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance shall be the sum of the amounts computed according to the provisions of subsection (a) above and the estimated cost traceable to the extra hazard of active duty in the uniformed services as determined by the Secretary, subject to the provision that such estimated costs traceable to the extra hazard shall be retroactively readjusted annually in accordance with section 1969(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Each policy so purchased shall include a provision that, in the event the Secretary determines that ascertaining the actual age distribution of the amounts of group life insurance in force at the date of issue of the policy or at the end of the first or any subsequent year of insurance thereunder would not be possible except at a disproportionately high expense, the Secretary may approve the determination of a tentative average group life premium, for the first or any subsequent policy year, in lieu of using the actual age distribution. Such tentative average premium rate shall be redetermined by the Secretary during any policy year upon request by the insurance company or companies issuing the policy, if experience indicates that the assumptions made in determining the tentative average premium rate for that policy year were incorrect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Each policy so purchased shall contain a provision stipulating the maximum expense and risk charges for the first policy year, which charges shall have been determined by the Secretary on a basis consistent with the general level of such charges made by life insurance companies under policies of group life insurance issued to large employers. Such maximum charges shall be continued from year to year, except that the Secretary may redetermine such maximum charges for any year either by agreement with the insurance company or companies issuing the policy or upon written notice given by the Secretary to such companies at least one year in advance of the beginning of the year for which such redetermined maximum charges will be effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Each such policy shall provide for an accounting to the Secretary not later than ninety days after the end of each policy year, which shall set forth, in a form approved by the Secretary, (1) the amounts of premiums actually accrued under the policy from its date of issue to the end of such policy year, (2) the total of all mortality and other claim charges incurred for that period, and (3) the amounts of the insurers&rsquo; expense and risk charge for that period. Any excess of the total of item (1) over the sum of items (2) and (3) shall be held by the insurance company or companies issuing the policy as a special contingency reserve to be used by such insurance company or companies for charges under such policy only, such reserve to bear interest at a rate to be determined in advance of each policy year by the insurance company or companies issuing the policy, which rate shall be approved by the Secretary as being consistent with the rates generally used by such company or companies for similar funds held under other group life insurance policies. If and when the Secretary determines that such special contingency reserve has attained an amount estimated by the Secretary to make satisfactory provision for adverse fluctuations in future charges under the policy, any further excess shall be deposited to the credit of the revolving fund established under section 1969(d)(1) of this title. If and when such policy is discontinued, and if after all charges have been made, there is <!-- PDFPage:344 -->any positive balance remaining in such special contingency reserve, such balance shall be deposited to the credit of the revolving fund, subject to the right of the insurance company or companies issuing the policy to make such deposit in equal monthly installments over a period of not more than two years.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance shall be issued in the amounts specified in section 1967(a) of this title. In the case of any individual, the amount of Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance may not exceed the amount of Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance coverage continued in force after the expiration of the period of duty or travel under section 1967(b) or 1968(a) of this title. No person may carry a combined amount of Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance and Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance at any one time in excess of the maximum amount for Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance in effect under section 1967(a)(3)(A)(i) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If any person insured under Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance again becomes insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance but dies before terminating or converting such person's Veterans&rsquo; Group Insurance, Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance shall be payable only if such person is insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance for less than the maximum amount for such insurance in effect under section 1967(a)(3)(A)(i) of this title, and then only in an amount which, when added to the amount of Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance payable, does not exceed such maximum amount in effect under such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Not more than once in each five-year period beginning on the one-year anniversary of the date a person becomes insured under Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance, such person may elect in writing to increase by $25,000 the amount for which the person is insured if&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:346 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the person is under the age of 60; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the total amount for which the person is insured does not exceed the amount provided for under section 1967(a)(3)(A)(i) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance shall (1) provide protection against death; (2) be issued on a renewable five-year term basis; (3) have no cash, loan, paid-up, or extended values; (4) except as otherwise provided, lapse for nonpayment of premiums; and (5) contain such other terms and conditions as the Secretary determines to be reasonable and practicable which are not specifically provided for in this section, including any provisions of this subchapter not specifically made inapplicable by the provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The premiums for Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance shall be established under the criteria set forth in sections 1971(a) and (c) of this title, except that the Secretary may provide for average premiums for such various age groupings as the Secretary may decide to be necessary according to sound actuarial principles, and shall include an amount necessary to cover the administrative cost of such insurance to the company or companies issuing such insurance. Such premiums shall be payable by the insureds thereunder as provided by the Secretary directly to the administrative office established for such insurance under section 1966(b) of this title. In any case in which a member or former member who was mentally incompetent on the date such member or former member first became insured under Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance dies within one year of such date, such insurance shall be deemed not to have lapsed for nonpayment of premiums and to have been in force on the date of death. Where insurance is in force under the preceding sentence, any unpaid premiums may be deducted from the proceeds of the insurance. Any person who claims eligibility for Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance based on disability incurred during a period of duty shall be required to submit evidence of qualifying health conditions and, if required, to submit to physical examinations at their own expense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Any amount of Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance in force on any person on the date of such person's death shall be paid, upon the establishment of a valid claim therefor, pursuant to the provisions of section 1970 of this title. However, any designation of beneficiary or beneficiaries for Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance filed with a uniformed service until changed, shall be considered a designation of beneficiary or beneficiaries for Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance, but not for more than sixty days after the effective date of the insured's Veterans&rsquo; Group Insurance, unless at the end of such sixty-day period, the insured is incompetent in which event such designation may continue in force until the disability is removed but not for more than five years after the effective date of the insured's Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance. Except as indicated above in incompetent cases, after such sixty-day period, any designation of beneficiary or beneficiaries for Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance to be effective must be by a writing signed by the insured and received by the administrative office established under section 1966(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) An insured under Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance shall have the right at any time to convert such insurance to an individual policy of life insurance upon written application for conversion made to the participating company the insured selects and payment of the required premiums. The individual policy will be issued without medical examination on a plan then currently written by such company which does not provide for the payment of any sum less than the face value thereof or for the payment of an additional amount as premiums in the event the insured performs active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training. The Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance policy converted to an individual policy under this subsection shall terminate on the day before the date on which the individual policy becomes effective. Upon request to the administrative office established under section 1966(b) of this title, an insured under Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance shall be furnished a list of life insurance companies participating in the program established under this subchapter. In addition to the life insurance companies participating in the program established under this subchapter, the list furnished to an insured under this section shall include additional life insurance companies (not so participating) which meet qualifying criteria, terms, and conditions established by the Secretary and agree to sell insurance to former members in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The provisions of subsections (d) and (e) of section 1971 of this title shall be applicable to Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance. However, a separate accounting shall be required for each program of insurance authorized under this subchapter. In such accounting, the Secretary is authorized to allocate claims and other costs among such programs of insurance according to accepted actuarial principles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Any person whose Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance was continued in force after termination of duty or discharge from service under the law as in effect prior to the date on which the Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance program (provided for under section 1977 of this title) became effective, and whose coverage under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance terminated less than four years prior to such date, shall be eligible within one year from the effective date of the Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance program to apply for and be granted Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance in an amount equal to the amount of the insured's Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance which was not converted to an individual policy under prior law. Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance issued under this subsection shall be issued for a term period equal to five years, less the time elapsing between the termination of the applicant's Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance and the effective date on which the Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance program became effective. Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance under this subsection shall only be issued upon application to the administrative office established under section 1966(b) of this title, payment of the required premium, and proof of good health satisfactory to that office, which proof shall be submitted at the appli<!-- PDFPage:347 -->cant's own expense. Any person who cannot meet the good health requirements for insurance under this subsection solely because of a service-connected disability shall have such disability waived. For each month for which any eligible veteran, whose service-connected disabilities are waived, is insured under this subsection there shall be contributed to the insurer or insurers issuing the policy or policies from the appropriation &ldquo;Compensation and Pensions, Department of Veterans Affairs&rdquo; an amount necessary to cover the cost of the insurance in excess of the premiums established for eligible veterans, including the cost of the excess mortality attributable to such veteran's service-connected disabilities. The Secretary may establish, as the Secretary may determine to be necessary according to sound actuarial principles, a separate premium, age groupings for premium purposes, accounting, and reserves, for persons granted insurance under this subsection different from those established for other persons granted insurance under this section. Appropriations to carry out the purpose of this section are hereby authorized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, members of the Individual Ready Reserve and the Inactive National Guard are eligible to be insured under Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance. Any such member shall be so insured upon submission of an application in the manner prescribed by the Secretary and the payment of premiums as required under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In accordance with subsection (b), Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance coverage under this subsection shall be issued on a renewable five-year term basis, but the person insured must remain a member of the Individual Ready Reserve or Inactive National Guard throughout the period of the insurance in order for the insurance of such person to be renewed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purpose of this subsection, the terms &ldquo;Individual Ready Reserve&rdquo; and &ldquo;Inactive National Guard&rdquo; shall have the meanings prescribed by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Defense.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) A member of the uniformed services who is insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance shall automatically be insured for traumatic injury in accordance with this section.

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) A member who is insured against traumatic injury under this section is insured against such losses due to traumatic injury (in this section referred to as &ldquo;qualifying losses&rdquo;) as are prescribed by the Secretary by regulation.

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A payment may be made to a member under this section only for a qualifying loss that results directly from a traumatic injury sustained while the member is covered against loss under this section and from no other cause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A payment may be made to a member under this section for a qualifying loss resulting from a traumatic injury only for a loss that is incurred during the applicable period of time specified pursuant to subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For each qualifying loss, the Secretary shall prescribe, by regulation, a period of time to be the period of time within which a loss of that type must be incurred, determined from the date on which the member sustains the traumatic injury resulting in that loss, in order for that loss to be covered under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall determine the premium amounts to be charged for traumatic injury protection coverage provided under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The premium amounts shall be determined on the basis of sound actuarial principles and shall include an amount necessary to cover the administrative costs to the insurer or insurers providing such insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Each premium rate for the first policy year shall be continued for subsequent policy years, except that the rate may be adjusted for any such subsequent policy year on the basis of the experience under the policy, as determined by the Secretary in advance of that policy year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The cost attributable to insuring members under this section for any month or other period specified by the Secretary, less the premiums paid by the members, shall be paid by the Secretary concerned to the Secretary. The Secretary shall allocate the amount payable among the uniformed services using such methods and data as the Secretary determines to be reasonable and practicable. Payments under this paragraph shall be made on a monthly basis or at such other intervals as may be specified by the Secretary and shall be made within 10 days of the date on which the Secretary provides notice to the Secretary concerned of the amount required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) For each period for which a payment by a Secretary concerned is required under paragraph <!-- PDFPage:351 -->(6), the Secretary concerned shall contribute such amount from appropriations available for active duty pay of the uniformed service concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The sums withheld from the basic or other pay of members, or collected from them by the Secretary concerned, under this subsection, and the sums contributed from appropriations under this subsection, together with the income derived from any dividends or premium rate adjustments received from insurers shall be deposited to the credit of the revolving fund established in the Treasury of the United States under section 1869(d)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) When a claim for benefits is submitted under this section, the Secretary of Defense or, in the case of a member not under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary concerned, shall certify to the Secretary whether the member with respect to whom the claim is submitted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) was at the time of the injury giving rise to the claim insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance for the purposes of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has sustained a qualifying loss.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Payment for a loss resulting from traumatic injury may not be made under the insurance coverage under this section if the member dies before the end of a period prescribed by the Secretary, by regulation, for such purpose that begins on the date on which the member sustains the injury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a member eligible for a payment under this section dies before payment to the member can be made, the payment shall be made to the beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom the payment would be made if the payment were life insurance under section 1967(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Coverage for loss resulting from traumatic injury provided under this section shall cease at midnight on the date of the termination of the member's duty status in the uniformed services that established eligibility for Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance. The termination of coverage under this section is effective in accordance with the preceding sentence, notwithstanding any continuation after the date specified in that sentence of Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance coverage pursuant to section 1968(a) of this title for a period specified in that section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Insurance coverage provided under this section is not convertible to Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Regulations under this section shall be prescribed in consultation with the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Designation of Fiduciary or Trustee</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary concerned, in consultation with the Secretary, shall develop a process for the designation of a fiduciary or trustee of a member of the uniformed services who is insured against traumatic injury under this section. The fiduciary or trustee so designated would receive a payment for a qualifying loss under this section if the member is medically incapacitated (as determined pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned in consultation with the Secretary) or experiencing an extended loss of consciousness.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The process under paragraph (1) may require each member of the uniformed services who is insured under this section to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) designate an individual as the member's fiduciary or trustee for purposes of subsection (a); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) elect that a court of proper jurisdiction designate an individual as the member's fiduciary or trustee for purposes of subsection (a) in the event that the member becomes medically incapacitated or experiences an extended loss of consciousness.</p>
