<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, in any case in which a veteran is furnished care or services under this chapter for a non-service-connected disability described in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the United States has the right to recover or collect reasonable charges for such care or services (as determined by the Secretary) from a third party to the extent that the veteran (or the provider of the care or services) would be eligible to receive payment for such care or services from such third party if the care or services had not been furnished by a department or agency of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection applies to a non-service-connected disability&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In order to enforce any right or claim to which the United States is subrogated under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the United States may intervene or join in any action or proceeding brought by the veteran (or the veteran's personal representative, successor, dependents, or survivors) against a third party.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:219 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) The United States may institute and prosecute legal proceedings against the third party if&mdash;</p>

Any determination of such charges shall be made in accordance with such regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Such regulations shall provide that reasonable charges for care or services sought to be recovered or collected from a third-party liable under a health-plan contract may not exceed the amount that such third party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary it would pay for the care or services if provided by facilities (other than facilities of departments or agencies of the United States) in the same geographic area.</p>
