<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that housing credit for purposes specified in section 3710 or 3712 of this title is not and has not been generally available <!-- PDFPage:536 -->to veterans living in rural areas, or in small cities and towns not near large metropolitan areas. It is therefore the purpose of this section to provide housing credit for veterans living in such rural areas and such small cities and towns.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Whenever the Secretary finds that private capital is not generally available in any rural area or small city or town for the financing of loans guaranteed for purposes specified in section 3710 or 3712 of this title, the Secretary shall designate such rural area or small city or town as a &ldquo;housing credit shortage area&rdquo;. The Secretary shall, with respect to any such area, make, or enter into commitments to make, to any veteran eligible under this title, a loan for any or all of the purposes described in section 3710(a) or 3712 of this title (other than the refinancing of a loan under section 3710(a)(8) or 3712(a)(1)(F)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) No loan may be made under this section to a veteran unless the veteran shows to the satisfaction of the Secretary that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the veteran is unable to obtain from a private lender in such housing credit shortage area, at an interest rate not in excess of the rate authorized for guaranteed home loans or manufactured home loans, as appropriate, a loan for such purpose for which the veteran is qualified under section 3710 or 3712 of this title, as appropriate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the veteran is unable to obtain a loan for such purpose from the Secretary of Agriculture under title III of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1921 et seq.) or title V of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Loans made under this section shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary, not to exceed the rate authorized for guaranteed home loans, or manufactured home loans, as appropriate, and shall be subject to such requirements or limitations prescribed for loans guaranteed under this title as may be applicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except for any loan made under this chapter for the purposes described in section 3712 of this title, the original principal amount of any loan made under this section shall not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to $33,000 as the amount of guaranty to which the veteran is entitled under section 3710 of this title at the time the loan is made bears to $36,000; and the guaranty entitlement of any veteran who heretofore or hereafter has been granted a loan under this section shall be charged with an amount which bears the same ratio to $36,000 as the amount of the loan bears to $33,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The original principal amount of any loan made under this section for the purposes described in section 3712 of this title shall not exceed the amount that bears the same ratio to $33,000 as the amount of guaranty to which the veteran is entitled under such section at the time the loan is made bears to $20,000. The amount of the guaranty entitlement for purposes specified in section 3710 of this title of any veteran who is granted a loan under this section, or who before October 18, 1978, was granted a loan under this section, shall be charged with the amount that bears the same ratio to $20,000 as the amount of the loan bears to $33,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No veteran may obtain loans under this section aggregating more than $33,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Loans made under this section shall be repaid in monthly installments, except that in the case of any such loan made for any of the purposes described in paragraphs (2), (3), or (4) of section 3710(a) of this title, the Secretary may provide that such loan shall be repaid in quarterly, semiannual, or annual installments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) In connection with any loan under this section, the Secretary may make advances in cash to pay taxes and assessments on the real estate, to provide for repairs, alterations, and improvements, and to meet the incidental expenses of the transaction. The Secretary shall determine the expenses incident to origination of loans made under this section, which expenses, or a reasonable flat allowance in lieu thereof, shall be paid by the veteran in addition to the loan closing costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Secretary may sell, and shall offer for sale, to any person or entity approved for such purpose by the Secretary, any loan made under this section at a price which the Secretary determines to be reasonable under the conditions prevailing in the mortgage market when the agreement to sell the loan is made; and shall guarantee any loan thus sold subject to the same conditions, terms, and limitations which would be applicable were the loan guaranteed for purposes specified in section 3710 or 3712 of this title, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The Secretary may exempt dwellings constructed through assistance provided by this section from the minimum land planning and subdivision requirements prescribed pursuant to subsection (a) of section 3704 of this title, and with respect to such dwellings may prescribe special minimum land planning and subdivision requirements which shall be in keeping with the general housing facilities in the locality but shall require that such dwellings meet minimum requirements of structural soundness and general acceptability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) The Secretary is authorized, without regard to the provisions of subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section, to make or enter into a commitment to make a loan to any veteran to assist the veteran in acquiring a specially adapted housing unit authorized under chapter 21 of this title, if the veteran is determined to be eligible for the benefits of such chapter 21, and is eligible for loan guaranty benefits under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j)(1) If any builder or sponsor proposes to construct one or more dwellings in a housing credit shortage area, or in any area for a veteran who is determined to be eligible for assistance in acquiring a specially adapted housing unit under chapter 21 of this title, the Secretary may enter into commitment with such builder or sponsor, under which funds available for loans under this section will be reserved for a period not in excess of three months, or such longer period as the Secretary may authorize to meet the needs in any particular case, for the purpose of making loans to veterans to purchase such dwellings. Such commitment may not be assigned or transferred except with the written approval of the Secretary. The Secretary shall not enter into any such commitment unless such builder or sponsor pays a nonrefundable commitment fee to the Secretary in an amount determined <!-- PDFPage:537 -->by the Secretary, not to exceed 2 percent of the funds reserved for such builder or sponsor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever the Secretary finds that a dwelling with respect to which funds are being reserved under this subsection has been sold, or contracted to be sold, to a veteran eligible for a direct loan under this section, the Secretary shall enter into a commitment to make the veteran a loan for the purchase of such dwelling. With respect to any loan made to an eligible veteran under this subsection, the Secretary may make advances during the construction of the dwelling, up to a maximum in advances of (A) the cost of the land plus (B) 80 percent of the value of the construction in place.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) Without regard to any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary may take or cause to be taken such action as in the Secretary's judgment may be necessary or appropriate for or in connection with the custody, management, protection, and realization or sale of investments under this section, may determine the Secretary's necessary expenses and expenditures, and the manner in which the same shall be incurred, allowed and paid, may make such rules, regulations, and orders as the Secretary may deem necessary or appropriate for carrying out the Secretary's functions under this section and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, may employ, utilize, compensate, and, to the extent not inconsistent with the Secretary's basic responsibilities under this chapter, delegate any of the Secretary's functions under this section to such persons and such corporate or other agencies, including agencies of the United States, as the Secretary may designate.</p>
