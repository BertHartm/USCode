<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In order to recruit and retain highly qualified physicians and dentists in the Veterans Health Administration, the Secretary shall provide special pay under this subchapter. Such special pay shall be provided under regulations that the Secretary shall prescribe to carry out this subchapter. Before prescribing regulations under this subchapter, the Secretary shall receive the recommendations of the Under Secretary for Health with respect to those regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Special pay may be paid to a physician or dentist under this subchapter only upon the execution of, and for the duration of, a written agreement entered into by the physician or dentist in accordance with section 7432 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A physician or dentist serving a period of obligated service pursuant to chapter 76 of this title is not eligible for special pay under this subchapter during the first three years of such obligated service, except that, at the discretion of the Secretary and upon the recommendation of the Under Secretary for Health, such a physician or dentist may be paid special pay for full-time status during those three years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Secretary may determine categories of positions applicable to either physicians or dentists, or both, in the Veterans Health Administration as to which there is no significant recruitment and retention problem. While any such determination is in effect, the Secretary may not enter into an agreement under this subchapter with a physician or dentist serving in a position covered by the determination. Before making a determination under this paragraph, the Secretary shall receive the recommendations of the Under Secretary for Health with respect to the determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than one year after making any such determination with respect to a category of positions, and each year thereafter that such determination remains in effect, the Secretary shall make a redetermination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any determination under this subsection shall be in accordance with regulations prescribed to carry out this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If the Under Secretary for Health determines that payment of special pay to a physician or dentist who is employed on a less than half-time basis is the most cost-effective way available for providing needed medical or dental specialist services at a Department facility, the Under Secretary for Health may authorize the payment of special pay for factors other than for full-time status to that physician or dentist at a rate computed on the basis of the proportion that the part-time employment of the physician or dentist bears to full-time employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Special pay may not be paid under this section to a physician or dentist who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is employed on less than a quarter-time basis or on an intermittent basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) occupies an internship or residency training position; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:665 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is a reemployed annuitant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) In the case of a physician or dentist who is employed in a position that is covered by a determination by the Secretary under subsection (d)(1) that the Administration does not have a significant recruitment or retention problem with respect to a particular category of positions and who on the day before the effective date of this subchapter was receiving special pay under an agreement entered into under section 4118&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7431_1_target" name="7431_1">1</a></sup> of this title (as in effect before such date), the Secretary may pay to that physician or dentist, in addition to basic pay, retention pay under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The annual rate of such retention pay for any individual may not exceed the rate which, when added to the rate of basic pay payable to that individual, is equal to the sum of the annual rate of basic pay and the annual rate of special pay paid to that physician or dentist pursuant to the final agreement with that individual under such section 4118.<sup><a href="#7431_1_target" name="7431_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Such retention pay shall be treated for all purposes as special pay paid under subchapter III of chapter 74 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Retention pay under this subsection shall be paid under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7432. Special pay: written agreements</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) An agreement entered into by a physician or dentist under this subchapter shall cover a period of one year of service in the Veterans Health Administration unless the physician or dentist agrees to an agreement for a longer period of service, not to exceed four years, as specified in the agreement. A physician or dentist who has previously entered into such an agreement is eligible to enter into a subsequent agreement unless the physician or dentist has failed to refund to the United States any amount which the physician or dentist is obligated to refund under any such previous agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) An agreement under this subchapter shall provide that, if the physician or dentist entering into the agreement voluntarily, or because of misconduct, fails to complete any of the years of service covered by the agreement (measured from the anniversary date of the agreement), the physician or dentist shall refund an amount of special pay received under the agreement for that year equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a failure during the first year of service under the agreement, 100 percent of the amount received for that year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a failure during the second year of service under the agreement, 75 percent of the amount received for that year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the case of a failure during the third year of service under the agreement, 50 percent of the amount received for that year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) in the case of a failure during the fourth year of service under the agreement, 25 percent of the amount received for that year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary may waive (in whole or in part) the requirement for a refund under paragraph (1) in any case if the Secretary determines (in accordance with regulations prescribed under section 7431(a) of this title) that the failure to complete such period of service is the result of <!-- PDFPage:666 -->circumstances beyond the control of the physician or dentist.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may suspend a special pay agreement entered into under this section in the case of a physician or dentist who, having entered into the special pay agreement, enters a residency training program. Any such suspension shall terminate when the physician or dentist completes, withdraws from, or is no longer a participant in the program. During the period of such a suspension, the physician or dentist is not subject to the provisions of paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any such agreement shall specify the terms under which the Department and the physician or dentist may elect to terminate the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) If a proposed agreement under this subchapter will provide a total annual amount of special pay to be provided to a physician or dentist who has previously entered into an agreement under this subchapter (or under section 4118&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7432_1_target" name="7432_1">1</a></sup> of this title as in effect before the effective date of the Department of Veterans Affairs Physician and Dentist Recruitment and Retention Act of 1991) that will exceed the previous annual amount of special pay provided for the physician or dentist by more than 50 percent (other than in the case of a physician or dentist employed in an executive position in the Central Office of the Department), or that will be less than the previous annual amount of special pay provided for the physician or dentist by more than 25 percent, the proposed agreement shall be promptly submitted to the Secretary. The proposed agreement shall not take effect if it is disapproved by the Secretary within 60 days after the date on which the physician or dentist entered into the proposed agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the previous annual amount of special pay provided for a physician or dentist is the total annual amount of special pay provided, or to be provided, to the physician or dentist for the most recent year covered by an agreement entered into by the physician or dentist under this subchapter or under section 4118&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7432_1_target" name="7432_1">1</a></sup> of this title. In the case of an agreement entered into under section 4118&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7432_1_target" name="7432_1">1</a></sup> of this title, incentive pay shall be treated as special pay for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall adjust special pay as necessary for purposes of this subsection to reflect appropriately any change in the status of a physician or dentist (A) from full-time status to part-time status, (B) from part-time status to full-time status, or (C) from one proportion of time spent as a Department employee under part-time status employment to a different proportion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) If a proposed agreement under this subchapter (other than an agreement in the case of the Under Secretary for Health) will provide a total annual amount of special pay to be provided to a physician or dentist which, when added to the amount of basic pay of the physician or dentist, will be in excess of the amount payable for positions specified in section 5312 of title 5, the proposed agreement shall be promptly submitted for approval to the Secretary through the Under Secretary for Health. The agreement shall take effect at the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the physician or dentist entered into the proposed agreement if it is neither approved nor disapproved within that 60-day period. If the agreement is approved within that period, the agreement shall take effect as of the date of the approval. A proposed agreement may be disapproved under this paragraph only if it is determined that the amounts of special pay proposed to be paid are not necessary to recruit or retain the physician or dentist.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A proposed agreement under this subchapter with the Under Secretary for Health may provide for payment of special pay for which the Under Secretary for Health is eligible under this subchapter (other than that specified in section 7433(b)(4)(B) of this title) only to the extent specifically approved by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall include in the annual report required by section 7440 of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a statement of the number of agreements entered into during the period covered by the report under which the total amount of special pay to be provided, when added to the amount of basic pay of the physician or dentist, will be in excess of the amount payable for positions specified in section 5312 of title 5;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a statement of the number of proposed agreements which during the period covered by the report were disapproved under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a detailed explanation of the basis for disapproval of each such proposed agreement which was disapproved under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This subsection does not apply to any proposed agreement entered into after September 30, 1994.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In order to make possible the recruitment and retention of a well-qualified work force of physicians and dentists capable of providing quality care for eligible veterans, it is the policy of Congress to ensure that the levels of total pay for physicians and dentists of the Veterans Health Administration are fixed at levels reasonably comparable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) with the levels of total pay of physicians and dentists employed by or serving in other departments and agencies of the Federal Government; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) with the income of non-Federal physicians and dentists for the performance of services as physicians and dentists.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) To assist the Congress and the President in carrying out the policy stated in subsection (a), the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) define the bases for pay distinctions, if any, among various categories of physicians and dentists, including distinctions between physicians and dentists employed by the Veterans Health Administration and physicians and dentists employed by other departments and agencies of the Federal Government and between all Federal sector and non-Federal sector physicians and dentists; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) obtain measures of income from the employment or practice of physicians and dentists outside the Administration, including both the Federal and non-Federal sectors, for use as guidelines for setting and periodically adjusting the amounts of special pay for physicians and dentists of the Administration.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall submit to the President a report, on such date as the President may designate but not later than December 31, 1994, and once every four years thereafter, recommending appropriate rates of special pay to carry out the policy set forth in subsection (a) with respect to the pay of physicians and dentists in the Veterans Health Administration. The Secretary shall include in such report, when considered appropriate and necessary by the Secretary, recommendations for modifications of the special pay levels set forth in this subchapter whenever&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Department is unable to recruit or retain a sufficient work force of well-qualified physicians and dentists in the Administration because the incomes and other employee benefits, to the extent that those benefits are reasonably quantifiable, of physicians and dentists outside the Administration who perform comparable types of duties are significantly in excess of the levels of total pay (including basic pay and special pay) and other employee benefits, to the extent that those benefits are reasonably quantifiable, available to those physicians and dentists employed by the Administration; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) other extraordinary circumstances are such that special pay levels are needed to recruit or retain a sufficient number of well-qualified physicians and dentists.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The President shall include in the budget transmitted to the Congress under section 1105 of title 31 after the submission of each report of the Secretary under subsection (b)(2) recommendations with respect to the exact rates of special pay for physicians and dentists under this subchapter and the cost of those rates compared with the cost of the special pay rates in effect under this subchapter at the time the budget is transmitted.</p>
