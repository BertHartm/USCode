<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For the purposes of clause (2) of this subsection, need for a higher level of care shall be considered to be need for personal health-care services provided on a daily basis in the veteran's home by a person who is licensed to provide such services or who provides such services under the regular supervision of a licensed health-care professional. The existence of the need for such care shall be determined by a physician employed by the Department or, in areas where no such physician is available, by a physician carrying out such function under contract or fee arrangement based on an examination by such physician.

For the purpose of this subsection, the requirement of &ldquo;permanently housebound&rdquo; will be considered to have been met when the veteran is substantially confined to such veteran's house (ward or clinical areas, if institutionalized) or immediate premises due to a service-connected disability or disabilities which it is reasonably certain will remain throughout such veteran's lifetime.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) For the purposes of section 1110 of this title, and subject to section 1113 of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a disease specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection becoming manifest as specified in that paragraph in a veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) each additional disease (if any) that (i) the Secretary determines in regulations prescribed under this section warrants a presumption of service-connection by reason of having positive association with exposure to an herbicide agent, and (ii) becomes manifest within the period (if any) prescribed in such regulations in a veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, and while so serving was exposed to that herbicide agent,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be considered to have been incurred in or aggravated by such service, notwithstanding that there is no record of evidence of such disease during the period of such service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The diseases referred to in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection are the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma becoming manifest to a degree of disability of 10 percent or more.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Respiratory cancers (cancer of the lung, bronchus, larynx, or trachea) becoming manifest to a degree&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1116_1_target" name="1116_1">1</a></sup> of 10 percent or more within 30 years after the last date on which the veteran performed active military, naval, or air service in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) Multiple myeloma becoming manifest to a degree of disability of 10 percent or more.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purposes of this subsection, a veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, and has a disease referred to in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent containing dioxin or 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and may be presumed to have been exposed during such service to any other chemical compound in an herbicide agent, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to any such agent during that service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;herbicide agent&rdquo; means a chemical in an herbicide used in support of the United States and allied military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Secretary determines that a presumption of service connection is not warranted, the Secretary, not later than 60 days after making the determination, shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of that determination. The notice shall include an explanation of the scientific basis for that determination. If the disease already is included in regulations providing for a presumption of service connection, the Secretary, not later than 60 days after publication of the notice of a determination that the presumption is not warranted, shall issue proposed regulations removing the presumption for the disease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 90 days after the date on which the Secretary issues any proposed regula<!-- PDFPage:89 -->tions under this subsection, the Secretary shall issue final regulations. Such regulations shall be effective on the date of issuance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Whenever a disease is removed from regulations prescribed under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a veteran who was awarded compensation for such disease on the basis of the presumption provided in subsection (a) before the effective date of the removal shall continue to be entitled to receive compensation on that basis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a survivor of a veteran who was awarded dependency and indemnity compensation for the death of a veteran resulting from such disease on the basis of such presumption shall continue to be entitled to receive dependency and indemnity compensation on such basis.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="note-head">Persian Gulf War Veterans&rsquo; Benefits</h4>
<p class="note-body">Sections 102 to 105, 107, 109, and 110 of title I of Pub. L. 103&ndash;446, as amended by Pub. L. 104&ndash;262, title III, &sect;352(a), Oct. 9, 1996, 110 Stat. 3210; Pub. L. 105&ndash;368, title I, &sect;107, Nov. 11, 1998, 112 Stat. 3325, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 102. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) During the Persian Gulf War, members of the Armed Forces were exposed to numerous potentially toxic substances, including fumes and smoke from military operations, oil well fires, diesel exhaust, paints, pesticides, depleted uranium, infectious agents, investigational drugs and vaccines, and indigenous diseases, and were also given multiple immunizations. It is not known whether these servicemembers were exposed to chemical or biological warfare agents. However, threats of enemy use of chemical and biological warfare heightened the psychological stress associated with the military operation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Significant numbers of veterans of the Persian Gulf War are suffering from illnesses, or are exhibit<!-- PDFPage:96 -->ing symptoms of illness, that cannot now be diagnosed or clearly defined. As a result, many of these conditions or illnesses are not considered to be service connected under current law for purposes of benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The National Institutes of Health Technology Assessment Workshop on the Persian Gulf Experience and Health, held in April 1994, concluded that the complex biological, chemical, physical, and psychological environment of the Southwest Asia theater of operations produced complex adverse health effects in Persian Gulf War veterans and that no single disease entity or syndrome is apparent. Rather, it may be that the illnesses suffered by those veterans result from multiple illnesses with overlapping symptoms and causes that have yet to be defined.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) That workshop concluded that the information concerning the range and intensity of exposure to toxic substances by military personnel in the Southwest Asia theater of operations is very limited and that such information was collected only after a considerable delay.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) In response to concerns regarding the health-care needs of Persian Gulf War veterans, particularly those who suffer from illnesses or conditions for which no diagnosis has been made, the Congress, in Public Law 102&ndash;585 [see Short Title of 1992 Amendments note under section 101 of this title], directed the establishment of a Persian Gulf War Veterans Health Registry, authorized health examinations for veterans of the Persian Gulf War, and provided for the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive review and assessment of information regarding the health consequences of military service in the Persian Gulf theater of operations and to develop recommendations on avenues for research regarding such health consequences. In Public Law 103&ndash;210 [see Tables for classification], the Congress authorized the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide health care services on a priority basis to Persian Gulf War veterans. The Congress also provided in Public Law 103&ndash;160 (the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994) [see Tables for classification] for the establishment of a specialized environmental medical facility for the conduct of research into the possible health effects of exposure to low levels of hazardous chemicals, especially among Persian Gulf veterans, and for research into the possible health effects of battlefield exposure in such veterans to depleted uranium.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In response to concerns about the lack of objective research on Gulf War illnesses, Congress included research provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 [Pub. L. 103&ndash;337, see Tables for classification], which was passed by the House and Senate in September 1994. This legislation requires the Secretary of Defense to provide research grants to non-Federal researchers to support three types of studies of the Gulf War syndrome. The first type of study will be an epidemiological study or studies of the incidence, prevalence, and nature of the illness and symptoms and the risk factors associated with symptoms or illnesses. This will include illnesses among spouses and birth defects and illnesses among offspring born before and after the Gulf War. The second group of studies shall be conducted to determine the health consequences of the use of pyridostigmine bromide as a pretreatment antidote enhancer during the Persian Gulf War, alone or in combination with exposure to pesticides, environmental toxins, and other hazardous substances. The final group of studies shall include clinical research and other studies on the causes, possible transmission, and treatment of Gulf War syndrome, and will include studies of veterans and their spouses and children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Further research and studies must be undertaken to determine the underlying causes of the illnesses suffered by Persian Gulf War veterans and, pending the outcome of such research, veterans who are seriously ill as the result of such illnesses should be given the benefit of the doubt and be provided compensation benefits to offset the impairment in earnings capacities they may be experiencing.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 103. PURPOSES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The purposes of this title [see Short Title of 1994 Amendments note under section 101 of this title] are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to provide compensation to Persian Gulf War veterans who suffer disabilities resulting from illnesses that cannot now be diagnosed or defined, and for which other causes cannot be identified;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop at the earliest possible date case assessment strategies and definitions or diagnoses of such illnesses;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to promote greater outreach to Persian Gulf War veterans and their families to inform them of ongoing research activities, as well as the services and benefits to which they are currently entitled; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to ensure that research activities and accompanying surveys of Persian Gulf War veterans are appropriately funded and undertaken by the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>

The protocol shall include an evaluation of complaints relating to illnesses involving the reproductive system.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) If such a protocol is not implemented before the end of the 120-day period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act [Nov. 2, 1994], the Secretary shall, before the end of such period, submit to the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives a report as to why such a protocol has not yet been developed.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(3)(A) The Secretary shall ensure that the evaluation under the protocol developed under this section is available at all Department medical centers that have the capability of providing the medical assessment, diagnosis, and treatment required under the protocol.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(B) The Secretary may enter into contracts with non-Department medical facilities for the provision of the evaluation under the protocol.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(C) In the case of a veteran whose residence is distant from a medical center described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary may provide the evaluation through a Department medical center described in that subparagraph and, in such a case, may provide the veteran the travel and incidental expenses therefor pursuant to the provisions of section 111 of title 38, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(4)(A) If the Secretary is unable to diagnose the symptoms or illness of a veteran provided an evaluation, or if the symptoms or illness of a veteran do not respond to treatment provided by the Secretary, the Secretary may use the authority in section 1703 of title 38, United States Code, in order to provide for the veteran to receive diagnostic tests or treatment at a non-Department medical facility that may have the capability of diagnosing or treating the symptoms or illness of the veteran. The Secretary may provide the veteran the travel and incidental expenses therefor pursuant to the provisions of section 111 of title 38, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(B) The Secretary shall request from each non-Department medical facility that examines or treats a veteran under this paragraph such information relating to the diagnosis or treatment as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:97 --><p class="note-body">&ldquo;(5) In each year after the implementation of the protocol, the Secretary shall enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences under which agreement appropriate experts shall review the adequacy of the protocol and its implementation by the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Relationship to Other Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Protocols</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall ensure that the information collected through the protocol described in this section is collected and maintained in a manner that permits the effective and efficient cross-reference of that information with information collected and maintained through the comprehensive clinical protocols of the Department of Defense for Persian Gulf War veterans.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Case Definitions and Diagnoses</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall develop case definitions or diagnoses for illnesses associated with the service described in subsection (a)(1). The Secretary shall develop such definitions or diagnoses at the earliest possible date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) An illness referred to in paragraph (1) is any diagnosed or undiagnosed illness that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary determines in regulations prescribed under this section to warrant a presumption of service connection by reason of having a positive association with exposure to a biological, chemical, or other toxic agent, environmental or wartime hazard, or preventive medicine or vaccine known or presumed to be associated with service in the Armed Forces in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) becomes manifest within the period, if any, prescribed in such regulations in a veteran who served on active duty in that theater of operations during that war and by reason of such service was exposed to such agent, hazard, or medicine or vaccine.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, a veteran who served on active duty in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War and has an illness described in paragraph (2) shall be presumed to have been exposed by reason of such service to the agent, hazard, or medicine or vaccine associated with the illness in the regulations prescribed under this section unless there is conclusive evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to the agent, hazard, or medicine or vaccine by reason of such service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1)(A) Whenever the Secretary makes a determination described in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall prescribe regulations providing that a presumption of service connection is warranted for the illness covered by that determination for purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A determination referred to in subparagraph (A) is a determination based on sound medical and scientific evidence that a positive association exists between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the exposure of humans or animals to a biological, chemical, or other toxic agent, environmental or wartime hazard, or preventive medicine or vaccine known or presumed to be associated with service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(3) An association between the occurrence of an illness in humans or animals and exposure to an agent, hazard, or medicine or vaccine shall be considered to be positive for purposes of this subsection if the credible evidence for the association is equal to or outweighs the credible evidence against the association.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Not later than 60 days after the date on which the Secretary receives a report from the <!-- PDFPage:100 -->National Academy of Sciences under section 1603 of the Persian Gulf War Veterans Act of 1998, the Secretary shall determine whether or not a presumption of service connection is warranted for each illness, if any, covered by the report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary determines under this subsection that a presumption of service connection is warranted, the Secretary shall, not later than 60 days after making the determination, issue proposed regulations setting forth the Secretary's determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If the Secretary determines under this subsection that a presumption of service connection is not warranted, the Secretary shall, not later than 60 days after making the determination, publish in the Federal Register a notice of the determination. The notice shall include an explanation of the scientific basis for the determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If an illness already presumed to be service connected under this section is subject to a determination under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall, not later than 60 days after publication of the notice under that subparagraph, issue proposed regulations removing the presumption of service connection for the illness.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Not later than 90 days after the date on which the Secretary issues any proposed regulations under this subsection, the Secretary shall issue final regulations. Such regulations shall be effective on the date of issuance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Whenever the presumption of service connection for an illness under this section is removed under subsection (c)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a veteran who was awarded compensation for the illness on the basis of the presumption before the effective date of the removal of the presumption shall continue to be entitled to receive compensation on that basis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a survivor of a veteran who was awarded dependency and indemnity compensation for the death of a veteran resulting from the illness on the basis of the presumption before that date shall continue to be entitled to receive dependency and indemnity compensation on that basis.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;short title</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. This Act [amending this section, enacting provisions set out as notes under this section, and amending provisions set out as notes under this section and section 1116 of this title] may be cited as the &lsquo;Veterans&rsquo; Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act&rsquo;.</p>
<!-- field-end:shorttitle-note -->
<!-- field-start:miscellaneous-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Veterans who served in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era and veterans who participated in atmospheric nuclear tests or the American occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, Japan, are deeply concerned about possible long-term health effects of exposure to herbicides containing dioxin or to ionizing radiation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) There is scientific and medical uncertainty regarding such long-term adverse health effects.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In section 102 of Public Law 97&ndash;22 [see Tables for classification], the Congress responded to that uncertainty by authorizing priority medical care at Veterans&rsquo; Administration [now Department of Veterans Affairs] facilities for any disability of a veteran who may have been so exposed (even though there is insufficient medical evidence linking such disability with such exposure) unless the disability is found to have resulted from a cause other than the exposure.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The Congress has further responded to that medical and scientific uncertainty by requiring, in section 307 of Public Law 96&ndash;151 [set out as a note under section 1116 of this title] and section 601 of Public Law 98&ndash;160 [set out below], the conduct of thorough epidemiological studies of the health effects experienced by veterans in connection with exposure both to herbicides containing dioxin and (if not determined to be scientifically infeasible) to radiation, and by requiring in Public Law 97&ndash;414 [see Tables for classification], the development of radioepidemiological tables setting forth the probabilities of causation between various cancers and exposure to radiation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) There is some evidence that most types of leukemia, malignancies of the thyroid, female breast, lung, bone, liver, and skin, and polycythemia vera are associated with exposure to certain levels of ionizing radiation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) As of the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 24, 1984], there are sixty-six federally sponsored research projects being conducted relating to herbicides containing dioxin, at a cost to the Federal Government in excess of $130,000,000 and, as of 1981, federally sponsored research projects relating to ionizing radiation were costing the Federal Government more than $115,000,000.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The initial results of one project&mdash;an epidemiological study, conducted by the United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine, of the health status of the &lsquo;Ranch Hand&rsquo; veterans who carried out the loading and aerial spraying of herbicides containing dioxin in Vietnam and in the process came into direct skin contact with such herbicides in their most concentrated liquid form&mdash;were released on February 24, 1984, and contained the conclusion &lsquo;that there is insufficient evidence to support a cause and effect relationship between herbicide exposure and adverse health in the Ranch Hand group at this time&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The &lsquo;film badges&rsquo; which were originally issued to members of the Armed Forces in connection with the atmospheric nuclear test program have previously constituted a primary source of dose information for veterans (and survivors of veterans) filing claims for Veterans&rsquo; Administration [now Department of Veterans Affairs] disability compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation in connection with exposure to radiation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) These film badges often provide an incomplete measure of radiation exposure, since they were not capable of recording inhaled, ingested, or neutron doses (although the Defense Nuclear Agency currently has the capability to reconstruct individual estimates of such doses), were not issued to most of the participants in nuclear tests, often provided questionable readings because they were shielded during the detonation, and were worn for only limited periods during and after each nuclear detonation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Standards governing the reporting of dose estimates in connection with radiation-related claims for Veterans&rsquo; Administration [now Department of Veterans Affairs] disability compensation vary among the several branches of the Armed Forces, and no uniform minimum standards exist.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) The Veterans&rsquo; Administration [now Department of Veterans Affairs] has not promulgated permanent regulations setting forth specific guidelines, standards, and criteria for the adjudication of claims for Veterans&rsquo; Administration disability compensation based on exposure to herbicides containing dioxin or to ionizing radiation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Such claims (especially those involving health effects with long latency periods) present adjudicatory issues which are significantly different from issues generally presented in claims based upon the usual types of injuries incurred in military service.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) It has always been the policy of the Veterans&rsquo; Administration [now Department of Veterans Affairs] and is the policy of the United States, with respect to individual claims for service connection of diseases and disabilities, that when, after consideration of all evidence and material of record, there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of a claim, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;purpose</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that Veterans&rsquo; Administration [now Department of Veterans Affairs] disability compensation is provided to veterans who were exposed to ionizing radiation in connection with atmospheric nuclear tests or in connection with the American occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, Japan, for all disabilities arising after that service that are connected, based on sound scientific and medical evidence, to such service (and that Veterans&rsquo; Administration dependency and indemnity compensation is provided to survivors of those veterans for all deaths resulting from such disabilities).&rdquo;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) In the case of a veteran under age 45 who is awarded a pension during the program period, the Secretary shall, based on information on file with the Department of Veterans Affairs, make a preliminary finding whether such veteran, with the assistance of a vocational training program under this section, has a good potential for achieving employment. If such potential is found to exist, the Secretary shall solicit from the veteran an application for vocational training under this section. If the veteran thereafter applies for such training, the Secretary shall provide the veteran with an evaluation, which may include a personal interview, to determine whether the achievement of a vocational goal is reasonably feasible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a veteran who is 45 years of age or older and is awarded pension during the program period, or a veteran who was awarded pension before the beginning of the program period, applies for vocational training under this section and the Secretary makes a preliminary finding on the basis of information in the application that, with the assistance of a vocational training program under subsection (b) of this section, the veteran has a good potential for achieving employment, the Secretary shall provide the veteran with an evaluation in order to determine whether the achievement of a vocational goal by the veteran is reasonably feasible. Any such evaluation shall include a personal interview by a Department employee trained in vocational counseling.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;program period&rdquo; means the period beginning on February 1, 1985, and ending on December 31, 1995.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) If the Secretary, based upon an evaluation under subsection (a) of this section, determines that the achievement of a vocational goal by a veteran is reasonably feasible, the veteran shall be offered and may elect to pursue a vocational training program under this subsection. If the veteran elects to pursue such a program, the program shall be designed in consultation with the veteran in order to meet the veteran's individual needs and shall be set forth in an individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation of the kind described in section 3107 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, a vocational training program under this subsection shall consist of vocationally oriented services and assistance of the kind provided under chapter 31 of this title and such other services and assistance of the kind provided under that chapter as are necessary to enable the veteran to prepare for and participate in vocational training or employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A vocational training program under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) may not exceed 24 months unless, based on a determination by the Secretary that an extension is necessary in order for the veteran to achieve a vocational goal identified (before the end of the first 24 months of such program) in the written plan formulated for the veteran, the Secretary grants an extension for a period not to exceed 24 months;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:152 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) may not include the provision of any loan or subsistence allowance or any automobile adaptive equipment of the kind provided under chapter 39 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) may include a program of education at an institution of higher learning (as defined in sections 3452(b) and 3452(f), respectively, of this title) only in a case in which the Secretary determines that the program involved is predominantly vocational in content.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) When a veteran completes a vocational training program under this subsection, the Secretary may provide the veteran with counseling of the kind described in section 3104(a)(2) of this title, placement and postplacement services of the kind described in section 3104(a)(5) of this title, and training of the kind described in section 3104(a)(6) of this title during a period not to exceed 18 months beginning on the date of such completion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A veteran may not begin pursuit of a vocational training program under this subsection after the later of (A) December 31, 1995, or (B) the end of a reasonable period of time, as determined by the Secretary, following either the evaluation of the veteran under subsection (a) of this section or the award of pension to the veteran as described in subsection (a)(2) of this section. Any determination by the Secretary of such a reasonable period of time shall be made pursuant to regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In the case of a veteran who has been determined to have a permanent and total non-service-connected disability and who, not later than one year after the date the veteran's eligibility for counseling under subsection (b)(3) of this section expires, secures employment within the scope of a vocational goal identified in the veteran's individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation (or in a related field which requires reasonably developed skills and the use of some or all of the training or services furnished the veteran under such plan), the evaluation of the veteran as having a permanent and total disability may not be terminated by reason of the veteran's capacity to engage in such employment until the veteran first maintains such employment for a period of not less than 12 consecutive months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A veteran who pursues a vocational training program under subsection (b) of this section shall have the benefit of the provisions of subsection (a) of section 1525 of this title beginning at such time as the veteran's entitlement to pension is terminated by reason of income from work or training (as defined in subsection (b)(1) of that section) without regard to the date on which the veteran's entitlement to pension is terminated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Payments by the Secretary for education, training, and other services and assistance under subsection (b) of this section (other than the services of Department employees) shall be made from the Department appropriations account from which payments for pension are made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary shall pay to the surviving spouse of each veteran of a period of war who met the service requirements prescribed in section 1521(j) of this title, or who at the time of death was receiving (or entitled to receive) compensation or retirement pay for a service-connected disability, pension at the rate prescribed by this section, as increased from time to time under section 5312 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If no child of the veteran is in the custody of the surviving spouse, pension shall be paid to the surviving spouse at the annual rate of $2,379, reduced by the amount of the surviving spouse's annual income.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If there is a child of the veteran in the custody of the surviving spouse, pension shall be paid to the surviving spouse at the annual rate of $3,116. If the surviving spouse has custody of two or more such children, the annual pension rate shall be increased by $600 for each such child in excess of one. In each case, the rate payable shall be reduced by the amount of the surviving spouse's annual income and, subject to subsection (g) of this section, the annual income of each such child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) If a surviving spouse who is entitled to pension under subsection (b) of this section is in need of regular aid and attendance, the annual rate of pension payable to such surviving spouse shall be $3,806, reduced by the amount of the surviving spouse's annual income.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a surviving spouse who is entitled to pension under subsection (c) of this section is in need of regular aid and attendance, the annual rate of pension payable to the surviving spouse shall be $4,543. If there are two or more children of the veteran in such surviving spouse's custody, the annual rate of pension shall be increased by $600 for each such child in excess of one. The rate payable shall be reduced by the amount of the surviving spouse's annual income and, subject to subsection (g) of this section, the annual income of each such child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) If the surviving spouse is permanently housebound but does not qualify for pension at the aid and attendance rate provided by subsection (d) of this section, the annual rate of pension payable to such surviving spouse under subsection (b) of this section shall be $2,908 and the annual rate of pension payable to such surviving spouse under subsection (c) of this section shall be $3,645. If there are two or more children of the veteran in such surviving spouse's custody, the annual rate of pension shall be increased by $600 for each such child in excess of one. The rate payable shall be reduced by the amount of the surviving spouse's annual income and, subject to subsection (g) of this section, the income of any child of the veteran for whom the surviving spouse is receiving increased pension.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the requirement of &ldquo;permanently housebound&rdquo; shall be met when the surviving spouse is substantially confined to such surviving spouse's house (ward or clinical areas, if institutionalized) or immediate premises by reason of a disability or disabilities reasonably certain to remain throughout such surviving spouse's lifetime.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) No pension shall be paid under this section to a surviving spouse of a veteran unless the spouse was married to the veteran&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) before (A) December 14, 1944, in the case of a surviving spouse of a Mexican border period or World War I veteran, (B) January 1, 1957, in the case of a surviving spouse of a World War II veteran, (C) February 1, 1965, in the case of a surviving spouse of a Korean conflict veteran, (D) May 8, 1985, in the case of a surviving spouse of a Vietnam era veteran, or (E) January 1, 2001, in the case of a surviving spouse of a veteran of the Persian Gulf War;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for any period of time if a child was born of the marriage, or was born to them before the marriage.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) In determining the annual income of a surviving spouse for the purposes of this section, if there is a child of the veteran in the custody of the surviving spouse, that portion of the annual income of the child that is reasonably available to or for the surviving spouse shall be considered to be income of the surviving spouse, unless in the judgment of the Secretary to do so would work a hardship on the surviving spouse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) As used in this section and section 1542 of this title, the term &ldquo;veteran&rdquo; includes a person who has completed at least two years of honorable active military, naval, or air service, as certified by the Secretary concerned, but whose death in such service was not in line of duty.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Diagnostic services necessary for determination of eligibility for, or of the appropriate course of treatment in connection with, furnishing medical services at independent Department out-patient clinics to obviate the need for hospital admission.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In the case of any veteran for whom the Secretary contracts to furnish care or services in a non-Department facility pursuant to a provision of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall periodically review the necessity for continuing such contractual arrangement pursuant to such provision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary shall include in the budget documents which the Secretary submits to Congress for any fiscal year a detailed report on the furnishing of contract care and services during the most recently completed fiscal year under this section, sections 1712A, 1720, 1720A, 1724, and 1732 of this title, and section 115 of the Veterans&rsquo; Benefits and Services Act of 1988 (Public Law 100&ndash;322; 102 Stat. 501).</p>

In any case in which the amount included in the President's Budget for any fiscal year for expenditures for contract dental care under such provisions is not in excess of the level of expenditures made for such purpose during fiscal year 1978 and the Secretary determines after the date of submission of such budget and before the end of such fiscal year that the level of expenditures for such contract dental care during such fiscal year will exceed the fiscal year 1978 level of expenditures, the Secretary shall submit a report to the appropriate committees of the Congress containing both a justification (with respect to the projected level of expenditures for such fiscal year) and an explanation as required in the preceding sentence in the case of a report submitted pursuant to such sentence. Any report submitted pursuant to this paragraph shall include a comment by the Secretary on the effect of the application of the criteria prescribed in the second sentence of section 1710(c) of this title for furnishing incidental dental care to hospitalized veterans.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the amount included in such Budget for such care.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Dental services and related appliances for a dental condition or disability described in paragraph (1)(B) of subsection (a) shall be furnished on a one-time completion basis, unless the services rendered on a one-time completion basis are found unacceptable within the limitations of good professional standards, in which event such additional services may be afforded as are required to complete professionally acceptable treatment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Dental appliances, wheelchairs, artificial limbs, trusses, special clothing, and similar appliances to be furnished by the Secretary under this section may be procured by the Secretary either by purchase or by manufacture, whichever the Secretary determines may be advantageous and reasonably necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary shall furnish to each veteran who is receiving additional compensation or allowance under chapter 11 of this title, or increased pension as a veteran of a period of war, by reason of being permanently housebound or in need of regular aid and attendance, such drugs and medicines as may be ordered on prescription of a duly licensed physician as specific therapy in the treatment of any illness or injury suffered by such veteran. The Secretary shall continue to furnish such drugs and medicines so ordered to any such veteran in need of regular aid and attendance whose pension payments have been discontinued solely because such veteran's annual income is greater than the applicable maximum annual income limitation, but only so long as such veteran's annual income does not exceed such maximum annual income limitation by more than $1,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) In order to assist the Secretary of Health and Human Services in carrying out national immunization programs under other provisions of law, the Secretary may authorize the administration of immunizations to eligible veterans who voluntarily request such immunizations in connection with the provision of care for a disability under this chapter in any Department health care facility. Any such immunization shall be made using vaccine furnished by the Secretary of Health and Human Services at no cost to the Department. For such purpose, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may provide such vaccine to the Department at no cost. Section 7316 of this title shall apply to claims alleging negligence or malpractice on the part of Department personnel granted immunity under such section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1712A. Eligibility for readjustment counseling and related mental health services</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1)(A) Upon the request of any veteran referred to in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall furnish counseling to the veteran to assist the veteran in readjusting to civilian life. Such counseling may include a general mental and psychological assessment of the veteran to ascertain whether such veteran has mental or psychological problems associated with readjustment to civilian life.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) applies to the following veterans:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Any veteran who served on active duty&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) in a theater of combat operations (as determined by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Defense) during the Vietnam era; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) after May 7, l975, in an area at a time during which hostilities occurred in that area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Any veteran (other than a veteran covered by clause (i)) who served on active duty during the Vietnam era who seeks or is furnished such counseling before January 1, 2000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Upon the request of any veteran (other than a veteran covered by paragraph (1)) who served in the active military, naval, or air service in a theater of combat operations (as so determined) during a period of war, or in any other area during a period in which hostilities (as defined in subparagraph (B)) occurred in such area, the Secretary may furnish counseling to the veteran to assist the veteran in readjusting to civilian life.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;hostilities&rdquo; means an armed conflict in which the members of the Armed Forces are subjected to danger comparable to the danger to which members of the Armed Forces have been subjected in combat with enemy armed forces during a period of war, as determined by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) If, on the basis of the assessment furnished under subsection (a) of this section, a physician or psychologist employed by the Department (or, in areas where no such physician or psychologist is available, a physician or psychologist carrying out such function under a contract or fee arrangement with the Secretary) determines that the provision of mental health services to such veteran is necessary to facilitate the successful readjustment of the veteran to civilian life, such veteran shall, within the limits of Department facilities, be furnished such services on an outpatient basis. For the purposes of furnishing such mental health services, the counseling furnished under subsection (a) of this section shall be considered to have been furnished by the Department as a part of hospital care. Any hospital care and other medical services considered necessary on the basis of the assessment furnished under subsection (a) of this section shall be furnished only in accordance with the eligibility criteria otherwise set forth in this chapter (including the eligibility criteria set forth in section 1711(b) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Mental health services furnished under paragraph (1) of this subsection may, if determined to be essential to the effective treatment and readjustment of the veteran, include such consultation, counseling, training, services, and expenses as are described in section 1701(6)(B) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">[(c) Repealed. Pub. L. 104&ndash;262, title III, &sect;331(b), Oct. 9, 1996, 110 Stat. 3198.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Under Secretary for Health may provide for such training of professional, paraprofessional, and lay personnel as is necessary to carry out this section effectively, and, in carrying out this section, may utilize the services of paraprofessionals, individuals who are volunteers working without compensation, and individuals who are veteran-students (as described in section 3485 of this title) in initial intake and screening activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) In furnishing counseling and related mental health services under subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the Secretary shall have available the same authority to enter into contracts with private facilities that is available to the Secretary (under sections 1703(a)(2) and 1710(a)(1)(B) of this title) in furnishing medical services to veterans suffering from total service-connected disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before furnishing counseling or related mental health services described in subsections (a) and (b) of this section through a contract facility, as authorized by this subsection, the Secretary shall approve (in accordance with criteria which the Secretary shall prescribe by regulation) the quality and effectiveness of the program operated by such facility for the purpose for which the counseling or services are to be furnished.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The authority of the Secretary to enter into contracts under this subsection shall be effective for any fiscal year only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of Defense, shall take such action as the Secretary considers appropriate to notify veterans who may be eligible for assistance under this section of such potential eligibility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, the Secretary may close or relocate a center in existence on January 1, 1988, only as described in the national plan required by paragraph (3) of this subsection (or in a revision to such plan under paragraph (4) of this subsection in which the closure or relocation of that center is proposed).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A closure or relocation of a center which is proposed in such national plan may be carried out only after the end of the 120-day period beginning on the date on which the national plan <!-- PDFPage:193 -->is submitted. A closure or relocation of a center not proposed in such plan may be carried out only after the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date the Secretary submits a revision to such plan in which the closure or relocation of that center is proposed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary may relocate a center in existence on January 1, 1988, without regard to the national plan (including any revision to such plan) if such relocation is to a new location away from a Department general health-care facility when such relocation is necessitated by circumstances beyond the control of the Department. Such a relocation may be carried out only after the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the Secretary notifies the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the proposed relocation, of the circumstances making it necessary, and of the reason for the selection of the new site for the center.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Not later than April 1, 1988, the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives a report on the Secretary's evaluation of the effectiveness in helping to meet the readjustment needs of veterans who served on active duty during the Vietnam era of the readjustment counseling and mental health services provided pursuant to this section (and of outreach efforts with respect to such counseling and services). Such report shall give particular attention, in light of the results of the study required by section 102 of the Veterans&rsquo; Health Care Amendments of 1983 (Public Law 98&ndash;160), to the provision of such counseling and services to veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and to the diagnosis and treatment of such disorder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The report required by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the opinion of the Secretary with respect to (I) the extent to which the readjustment needs of veterans who served on active duty during the Vietnam era remain unmet, and (II) the extent to which the provision of readjustment counseling services under this section in centers is needed to meet such needs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in light of the opinion submitted pursuant to clause (i) of this subparagraph, such recommendations for amendments to this subsection and for other legislative and administrative action as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary, after considering the recommendations of the Under Secretary for Health, shall submit to such committees a report setting forth a national plan for all centers in existence on January 1, 1988. Such national plan shall set forth the Secretary's proposals as to each such center for a period (to be determined by the Secretary) of not less than 12 months beginning on the date of the submission of the report. The plan shall include, as to each center, whether the Secretary proposes to relocate the center to a general Department facility, relocate the center to a new location away from a general Department facility, expand the center in the same location, or close the center. The plan shall also set forth any proposal of the Secretary to open additional centers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The plan shall include the Secretary's evaluation as to how, in light of each of the criteria described in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, the proposal set forth in the plan for each center covered by the plan would ensure the continued availability and effective furnishing of readjustment counseling services to eligible veterans needing such services in the geographic area served by that center.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall make the evaluation described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph with respect to any center in light of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The distribution of Vietnam-era veterans in the geographic area served by the center and the relationships between the location of such center and the general Department facility and such distribution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The distance between the center and the general Department facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The availability of other entities (such as State, local, or private outreach facilities) which provide assistance to Vietnam-era veterans in the area served by the center.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) The availability of transportation to, and parking at, the center and the general Department facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) The availability, cost, and suitability of the space at the general Department facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) The overall cost impact of the proposed closure or relocation, including a comparison of the recurring nonpersonnel costs of providing readjustment counseling to the same estimated number of veterans at the center and the general Department facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) The workload trends over the two previous fiscal years, and projected over the next fiscal year (or longer), at the center.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In providing rehabilitative services under this chapter, the Secretary, upon the recommendation of the Under Secretary for Health, may use the services of patients and members in Department health care facilities for therapeutic and rehabilitative purposes. Such patients and members shall not under these circumstances be held or considered as employees of the United States for any purpose. The Secretary shall prescribe the conditions for the use of such services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In furnishing rehabilitative services under this chapter, the Secretary, upon the recommendation of the Under Secretary for Health, may enter into a contract or other arrangement with any appropriate source (whether or not an element of the Department of Veterans Affairs or of any other Federal entity) to provide for therapeutic work for patients and members in Department health care facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may also furnish rehabilitative services under this subsection through contractual arrangements with nonprofit entities to provide for such therapeutic work for such patients.

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) There is hereby established in the Treasury of the United States a revolving fund known as the Department of Veterans Affairs Special Therapeutic and Rehabilitation Activities Fund (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;fund&rdquo;) for the purpose of furnishing rehabilitative services authorized in subsection (b) of this section. Such amounts of the fund as the Secretary may determine to be necessary to establish and maintain operating accounts for the various rehabilitative services activities may be deposited in checking accounts in other depositaries selected or established by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) All funds received by the Department under contractual arrangements made under subsection (b) of this section, or by nonprofit entities described in paragraph (2) of such subsection, shall be deposited in or credited to the fund, and the Secretary shall distribute out of the fund moneys to participants at rates not less than the wage rates specified in the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) and regulations prescribed thereunder for work of similar character.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Under Secretary for Health shall prepare, for inclusion in the annual report submitted to Congress under section 529 of this title, a description of the scope and achievements of activities carried out under this section (including pertinent data regarding productivity and rates of distribution) during the prior twelve months and an estimate of the needs of the program of therapeutic and rehabilitation activities to be carried out under this section for the ensuing fiscal year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) applies to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A veteran's participation in an activity carried out under this section.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) For the purposes of section 1710(a)(2)(G) of this title, a veteran shall be considered to be unable to defray the expenses of necessary care if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the veteran is eligible to receive medical assistance under a State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the veteran is in receipt of pension under section 1521 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the veteran's attributable income is not greater than the amount set forth in subsection (b).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) For purposes of subsection (a)(3), the income threshold for the calendar year beginning on January 1, 1990, is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) $17,240 in the case of a veteran with no dependents; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $20,688 in the case of a veteran with one dependent, plus $1,150 for each additional dependent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For a calendar year beginning after December 31, 1990, the amounts in effect for purposes of this subsection shall be the amounts in effect for the preceding calendar year as adjusted under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Effective on January 1 of each year, the amounts in effect under subsection (b) of this section shall be increased by the percentage by which the maximum rates of pension were increased under section 5312(a) of this title during the preceding calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Notwithstanding the attributable income of a veteran, the Secretary may refuse to make a determination described in paragraph (2) of this subsection if the corpus of the estate of the veteran is such that under all the circumstances it is reasonable that some part of the corpus of the estate of the veteran be consumed for the veteran's maintenance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A determination described in this paragraph is a determination that for purposes of subsection (a)(3) of this section a veteran's attributable income is not greater than the amount determined under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the corpus of the estate of a veteran shall be determined in the same manner as the manner in which determinations are made of the corpus of the estates of persons under section 1522 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) In order to avoid a hardship to a veteran described in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Secretary may deem the veteran to have an attributable income during the previous year not greater than the amount determined under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A veteran is described in this paragraph for the purposes of subsection (a) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the veteran has an attributable income greater than the amount determined under subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the current projections of such veteran's income for the current year are that the veteran's income for such year will be substantially below the amount determined under subsection (b).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) For purposes of this section:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:214 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;attributable income&rdquo; means the income of a veteran for the previous year determined in the same manner as the manner in which a determination is made of the total amount of income by which the rate of pension for such veteran under section 1521 of this title would be reduced if such veteran were eligible for pension under that section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;corpus of the estate of the veteran&rdquo; includes the corpus of the estates of the veteran's spouse and dependent children, if any.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;previous year&rdquo; means the calendar year preceding the year in which the veteran applies for care or services under section 1710(a) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) For the purposes of section 1724(c) of this title, the fact that a veteran is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) eligible to receive medical assistance under a State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a veteran with a service-connected disability; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in receipt of pension under any law administered by the Secretary,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be accepted as sufficient evidence of such veteran's inability to defray necessary expenses.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, in any case in which a veteran is furnished care or services under this chapter for a non-service-connected disability described in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the United States has the right to recover or collect reasonable charges for such care or services (as determined by the Secretary) from a third party to the extent that the veteran (or the provider of the care or services) would be eligible to receive payment for such care or services from such third party if the care or services had not been furnished by a department or agency of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection applies to a non-service-connected disability&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that is incurred incident to the veteran's employment and that is covered under a workers&rsquo; compensation law or plan that provides for payment for the cost of health care and services provided to the veteran by reason of the disability;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that is incurred as the result of a motor vehicle accident to which applies a State law that requires the owners or operators of motor vehicles registered in that State to have in force automobile accident reparations insurance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that is incurred as the result of a crime of personal violence that occurred in a State, or a political subdivision of a State, in which a person injured as the result of such a crime is entitled to receive health care and services at such State's or subdivision's expense for personal injuries suffered as the result of such crime;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) that is incurred by a veteran&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) who does not have a service-connected disability; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) who is entitled to care (or payment of the expenses of care) under a health-plan contract; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) for which care and services are furnished before October 1, 2002, under this chapter to a veteran who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) has a service-connected disability; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) is entitled to care (or payment of the expenses of care) under a health-plan contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of a health-plan contract that contains a requirement for payment of a deductible or copayment by the veteran&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the veteran's not having paid such deductible or copayment with respect to care or services furnished under this chapter shall not preclude recovery or collection under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount that the United States may collect or recover under this section shall be reduced by the appropriate deductible or copayment amount, or both.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) As to the right provided in subsection (a) of this section, the United States shall be subrogated to any right or claim that the veteran (or the veteran's personal representative, successor, dependents, or survivors) may have against a third party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In order to enforce any right or claim to which the United States is subrogated under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the United States may intervene or join in any action or proceeding brought by the veteran (or the veteran's personal representative, successor, dependents, or survivors) against a third party.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:219 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) The United States may institute and prosecute legal proceedings against the third party if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the United States has sent written notice by certified mail to the veteran at the veteran's last-known address (or to the veteran's personal representative or successor) of the intention of the United States to institute such legal proceedings; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A proceeding under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph may not be brought after the end of the six-year period beginning on the last day on which the care or services for which recovery is sought are furnished.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Secretary may compromise, settle, or waive any claim which the United States has under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary, after consultation with the Comptroller General of the United States, shall prescribe regulations for the purpose of determining reasonable charges for care or services under subsection (a)(1) of this section. Any determination of such charges shall be made in accordance with such regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Such regulations shall provide that reasonable charges for care or services sought to be recovered or collected from a third-party liable under a health-plan contract may not exceed the amount that such third party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary it would pay for the care or services if provided by facilities (other than facilities of departments or agencies of the United States) in the same geographic area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Not later than 45 days after the date on which the Secretary prescribes such regulations (or any amendment to such regulations), the Comptroller General shall submit to the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and the House of Representatives the Comptroller General's comments on and recommendations regarding such regulations (or amendment).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Any contract or agreement into which the Secretary enters with a person under section 3718 of title 31 for collection services to recover indebtedness owed the United States under this section shall provide, with respect to such services, that such person is subject to sections 5701 and 7332 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A veteran eligible for care or services under this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may not be denied such care or services by reason of this section; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) No law of any State or of any political subdivision of a State, and no provision of any contract or other agreement, shall operate to prevent recovery or collection by the United States under this section or with respect to care or services furnished under section 1711(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">[(g) Repealed. Pub. L. 105&ndash;33, title VIII, &sect;8023(b)(4), Aug. 5, 1997, 111 Stat. 667.]</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) There is in the Treasury a fund to be known as the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Care Collections Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Amounts recovered or collected after June 30, 1997, under any of the following provisions of law shall be deposited in the fund:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Public Law 87&ndash;693, popularly known as the &ldquo;Federal Medical Care Recovery Act&rdquo; (42 U.S.C. 2651 et seq.), to the extent that a recovery or collection under that law is based on medical care or services furnished under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Subject to the provisions of appropriations Acts, amounts in the fund shall be available, without fiscal year limitation, to the Secretary for the following purposes:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Furnishing medical care and services under this chapter, to be available during any fiscal year for the same purposes and subject to the same limitations (other than with respect to the period of availability for obligation) as apply to amounts appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury for that fiscal year for medical care.</p>

The Secretary shall make available to each region the entirety of the amount specified to be made available to such region by the preceding sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In this subsection, the term &ldquo;designated health care regions of the Department&rdquo; means the geographic areas designated by the Secretary for purposes of the management of, and allocation of resources for, health care services provided by the Department.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Subject to this section and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary under this section, the Secretary may assist a veteran by referring such veteran for placement in, and aiding such veteran in obtaining placement in, a community residential-care facility if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) at the time of initiating the assistance the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is furnishing the veteran medical services on an outpatient basis or hospital, domiciliary, or nursing home care; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary's approval of a facility for the purposes of this section shall be based upon the Secretary's determination, after inspection of the facility, that the facility meets the standards established in regulations prescribed under this section. Such standards shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Health and safety criteria, including a requirement of compliance with applicable State laws and local ordinances relating to health and safety.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Criteria for determining the resources that a facility needs in order to provide an appropriate level of services to veterans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Such other criteria as the Secretary determines are appropriate to protect the welfare of veterans placed in a facility under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Payment of the charges of a community residential-care facility for any care or service provided to a veteran whom the Secretary has referred to that facility under this section is not the responsibility of the United States or of the Department.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Insurance may be issued on the following plans: Five-year level premium term, ordinary life, twenty-payment life, thirty-payment life, twenty-year endowment, endowment at age sixty, and endowment at age sixty-five. Level premium term insurance may be converted as of the date when any premium becomes or has become due, or exchanged as of the date of the original policy, upon payment of the difference in reserve, at any time while such insurance is in force and within the term period to any of the foregoing permanent plans of insurance, except that conversion to an endowment plan may not be made while the insured is totally disabled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Under such regulations as the Secretary may promulgate a policy of participating insurance may be converted to or exchanged for insurance issued under this subsection on a modified life plan. Insurance issued under this subsection shall be on the same terms and conditions as the insurance which it replaces, except (1) the premium rates for such insurance shall be based on the 1958 Commissioners Standard Ordinary Basic Table of Mortality and interest at the rate of 3 per centum per annum; (2) all cash, loan, paid-up, and extended values shall be based on the 1958 Commissioners Standard Ordinary Basic Table of Mortality and interest at the rate of 3 per centum per annum; and (3) at the end of the day preceding the sixty-fifth birthday of the insured the face value of the modified life insurance policy or the amount of extended term insurance thereunder shall be automatically reduced by one-half thereof, without any reduction in premium.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Under such regulations as the Secretary may promulgate, a policy of nonparticipating insurance may be converted to or exchanged for insurance issued under this subsection on a modified life plan. Insurance issued under this subsection shall be on the same terms and conditions as the insurance which it replaces, except that (1) term insurance issued under section 621 of the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940 shall be deemed for the purposes of this subsection to have been issued under section 1923(b) of this title; and (2) at the end of the day preceding the sixty-fifth birthday of the insured the face value of the modified life insurance policy or the amount of extended term in<!-- PDFPage:237 -->surance thereunder shall be automatically reduced by one-half thereof, without any reduction in premium. Any person eligible for insurance under section 1922(a), or section 1925 of this title may be granted a modified life insurance policy under this subsection which, subject to exception (2) above, shall be issued on the same terms and conditions specified in section 1922(a) or section 1925, whichever is applicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Any insured whose modified life insurance policy is in force by payment or waiver of premiums on the day before the insured's sixty-fifth birthday may upon written application and payment of premiums made before such birthday be granted National Service Life Insurance, on an ordinary life plan, without physical examination, in an amount of not less than $500, in multiples of $250, but not in excess of one-half of the face amount of the modified life insurance policy in force on the day before the insured's sixty-fifth birthday. Insurance issued under this subsection shall be effective on the sixty-fifth birthday of the insured. The premium rate, cash, loan, paid-up, and extended values on the ordinary life insurance issued under this subsection shall be based on the same mortality tables and interest rates as the insurance issued under the modified life policy. Settlements on policies involving annuities on insurance issued under this subsection shall be based on the same mortality or annuity tables and interest rates as such settlements on the modified life policy. If the insured is totally disabled on the day before the insured's sixty-fifth birthday and premiums on the insured's modified life insurance policy are being waived under section 1912 of this title or the insured is entitled on that date to waiver under such section the insured shall be automatically granted the maximum amount of insurance authorized under this subsection and premiums on such insurance shall be waived during the continuous total disability of the insured.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) After June 30, 1972, and under such regulations as the Secretary may promulgate, insurance may be converted to or exchanged for insurance on a modified life plan under the same terms and conditions as are set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section except that at the end of the day preceding the seventieth birthday of the insured the face value of the modified life insurance policy or the amount of extended insurance thereunder shall be automatically reduced by one-half thereof, without any reduction in premium. Any insured whose modified life insurance policy issued under this subsection is in force by payment or waiver of premiums on the day before the insured's seventieth birthday may be granted insurance on the ordinary life plan upon the same terms and conditions as are set forth in subsection (d) of this section except that in applying such provisions the seventieth birthday is to be substituted for the sixty-fifth birthday. Notwithstanding any other provision of law or regulations the Secretary under such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines to be reasonable and practicable and upon written application and payment of the required premiums, reserves, or other necessary amounts made within one year from the effective date of this subsection by an insured having in force a modified life plan issued under subsection (b) or (c) of this section, including any replacement insurance issued under subsection (d) of this section or other provision of this title, can exchange such insurance without proof of good health for an amount of insurance issued under this subsection equal to the insurance then in force or which was in force on the day before such insured's sixty-fifth birthday, whichever is the greater.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Until and unless the Secretary has received from the insured a request or directive in writing exercising any other dividend option allowable under the insured's policy, any dividend accumulations and unpaid dividends shall be applied in payment of premiums becoming due on insurance subsequent to the date the dividend is payable after January 1, 1952.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) No claim by an insured for payment in cash of a special dividend declared prior to January 1, 1952, shall be processed by the Secretary unless such claim was received within six years after such dividend was declared. Whenever any claim for payment of a special dividend, the processing of which is barred by this subsection, is received by the Secretary, it shall be returned to the claimant, with a copy of this subsection, and such action shall be a complete response without further communication.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary, upon application in writing made by the insured for insurance under this subsection, and without proof of good health, is authorized to apply any dividend due and payable on national service life insurance after the date of such application to purchase paid up insurance. Also, the Secretary, upon application in writing made by the insured during the one-year period beginning September 1, 1991, and without proof of good health, is authorized to apply any national service life insurance dividend credits and deposits of such insured existing at the date of the insured's application to purchase paid up insurance. After September 1, 1992, the Secretary may, from time to time, provide for further one-year periods during which insureds may purchase additional paid up insurance from existing dividend credits and deposits. Any such period for the purchase of additional paid up insurance may be allowed only if the Secretary determines in the case of any such period that it would be actuarially and administratively sound to do so. Any dividends, dividend credits, or deposits on endowment policies may be used under this subsection only to purchase additional paid up endowment insurance which matures concurrently with the basic policy. Any dividends, dividend credits, or deposits on policies (other than endowment policies) may be used under this section only to purchase additional paid up whole life insurance. The paid up insurance granted under this subsection shall be in addition to any insurance otherwise authorized under this title, or under prior provisions of law. The paid up insurance granted under this subsection shall be issued on the same terms and conditions as are contained in the standard policies of national service life insurance except (1) the premium rates for such insurance and all cash and loan values thereon shall be based on such table of mortality and rate of interest per annum as may be prescribed by the Secretary; (2) the total disability income provision author<!-- PDFPage:239 -->ized under section 1915 of this title may not be added to insurance issued under this section; and (3) the insurance shall include such other changes in terms and conditions as the Secretary determines to be reasonable and practicable.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1912. Total disability waiver</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Upon application by the insured and under such regulations as the Secretary may promulgate, payment of premiums on insurance may be waived during the continuous total disability of the insured, which continues or has continued for six or more consecutive months, if such disability began (1) after the date of the insured's application for insurance, (2) while the insurance was in force under premium-paying conditions, and (3) before the insured's sixty-fifth birthday. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, in any case in which the total disability of the insured commenced on or after the insured's sixtieth birthday but before the insured's sixty-fifth birthday, the Secretary shall not grant waiver of any premium becoming due prior to January 1, 1965.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary, upon any application made after August 1, 1947, shall not grant waiver of any premium becoming due more than one year before the receipt by the Secretary of application for the same, except as provided in this section. Any premiums paid for months during which waiver is effective shall be refunded. The Secretary shall provide by regulations for examination or reexamination of an insured claiming benefits under this section, and may deny benefits for failure to cooperate. If it is found that an insured is no longer totally disabled, the waiver of premiums shall cease as of the date of such finding and the policy of insurance may be continued by payment of premiums as provided in said policy. In any case in which the Secretary finds that the insured's failure to make timely application for waiver of premiums or the insured's failure to submit satisfactory evidence of the existence or continuance of total disability was due to circumstances beyond the insured's control, the Secretary may grant waiver or continuance of waiver of premiums.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If the insured dies without filing application for waiver, the beneficiary, within one year after the death of the insured, or, if the beneficiary is insane or a minor, within one year after removal of such legal disability, may file application for waiver with evidence of the insured's right to waiver under this section. Premium rates shall be calculated without charge for the cost of waiver of premiums provided in this section and no deduction from benefits otherwise payable shall be made on account thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In any case in which an insured has been denied or would have been denied premium waiver under section 602(n) of the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940 or this section solely because the insured became totally disabled between the date of valid application for insurance and the subsequent effective date thereof, and in which it is shown that (1) the total disability was incurred in line of duty between October 8, 1940, and July 31, 1946, inclusive, or June 27, 1950, and April 30, 1951, inclusive, and (2) the insured remained continuously so totally disabled to the date of death or June 8, 1960, whichever is earlier, the Secretary may grant waiver of premiums from the beginning of and during the continuous total disability of such insured. Application for waiver of premiums under this subsection must be filed by the insured or, in the event of the insured's death, by the beneficiary within two years after June 8, 1960, except that if the insured or the beneficiary be insane or a minor within the two-year period, application for such waiver may be filed within two years after removal of such legal disability, or if an insane insured shall die before the removal of the disability, application may be filed by the beneficiary within two years after the insured's death. No insurance shall be placed in force under this subsection in any case in which there was an award of benefits under the Servicemen's Indemnity Act of 1951 or of gratuitous insurance under section 1922(b) of this title. The amount of insurance placed in force hereunder together with any other United States Government life insurance or national service life insurance in force at the time of death, or at the time of the insured's application for waiver hereunder, may not exceed $10,000 and shall be reduced by the amount of any gratuitous insurance awarded under the National Service Life Insurance Act of <!-- PDFPage:241 -->1940. Waiver of premiums under this subsection shall render the insurance nonparticipating during the period such premium waiver is in effect. The cost of waiver of premium and death benefits paid as a result of this subsection shall be borne by the United States.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1916. Insurance which matured before August 1, 1946</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Insurance which matured before August 1, 1946, is payable in the following manner:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If the beneficiary to whom payment is first made was under thirty years of age at the time of maturity, in two hundred and forty equal monthly installments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If the beneficiary to whom payment is first made was thirty or more years of age at the time of maturity, in equal monthly installments for one hundred and twenty months certain, with such payments continuing during the remaining lifetime of such beneficiary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If elected by the insured or a beneficiary entitled to make such an election under prior provisions of law, as a refund life income in monthly installments payable for such period certain as may be required in order that the sum of the installments certain, including a last installment of such reduced amount as may be necessary, shall equal the face value of the contract, less any indebtedness, with such payments continuing throughout the lifetime of the first beneficiary. A refund life income optional settlement is not available in any case in which such settlement would result in payments of installments over a shorter period than one hundred and twenty months. If the mode of payment is changed to a refund life income in accordance with prior provisions of law, after payment has commenced, payment of monthly installments will be adjusted as of the date of maturity of such policy with credit being allowed for payments previously made on the insurance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Such insurance shall be payable only to a widow, widower, child, parent, brother or sister of the insured. Any installments certain of such insurance remaining unpaid at the death of any beneficiary shall be paid in equal monthly installments in an amount equal to the monthly installments paid to the first beneficiary, to the person or persons then in being within the following classes, and in the order named, unless designated by the insured in a different order:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To the widow or widower of the insured, if living.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If no widow or widower, to the child or children of the insured, if living, in equal shares.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If no widow, widower, or child, to the parent or parents of the insured who last bore that relationship, if living, in equal shares.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If no widow, widower, child, or parent, to the brothers and sisters of the insured, if living, in equal shares.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The provisions of this section shall not be construed to enlarge the classes of beneficiaries heretofore authorized under section 602(d) of the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940, for payment of gratuitous insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If no beneficiary of insurance which matured before August 1, 1946, was designated by the insured or if the designated beneficiary did not survive the insured, the beneficiary shall be determined in accordance with the order specified in subsection (b) and the insurance shall be payable in equal monthly installments in accordance with subsection (a). The right of any beneficiary to payment of any installments of such insurance shall be conditioned upon his or her being alive to receive such payments. No person shall have a vested right to any installment or installments of any such insurance and any installments not paid to a beneficiary during such beneficiary's lifetime shall be paid to the beneficiary or beneficiaries within the permitted class next entitled to priority, as provided in subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) No installments of insurance which matured before August 1, 1946, shall be paid to the heirs or legal representatives as such of the insured or of any beneficiary, and if no person <!-- PDFPage:243 -->within the permitted class survives to receive the insurance or any part thereof no payment of the unpaid installments shall be made, except that if the reserve of a contract of converted National Service Life Insurance, together with dividends accumulated thereon, less any indebtedness under such contract, exceeds the aggregate amount paid to beneficiaries, the excess shall be paid to the estate of the insured unless the estate of the insured would escheat under the laws of the insured's place of residence, in which event no payment shall be made. When the amount of an individual monthly payment of such insurance is less than $5, such amount may, in the discretion of the Secretary, be allowed to accumulate without interest and be disbursed annually.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Any payments of insurance made to a person, represented by the insured to be within the permitted class of beneficiaries, shall be deemed to have been properly made and to satisfy fully the obligation of the United States under such insurance policy to the extent of such payments.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1917. Insurance maturing on or after August 1, 1946</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The insured shall have the right to designate the beneficiary or beneficiaries of insurance maturing on or after August 1, 1946, and shall, subject to regulations, at all times have the right to change the beneficiary or beneficiaries of such insurance without the consent of such beneficiary or beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Insurance maturing on or after August 1, 1946, shall be payable in accordance with the following optional modes of settlement:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In one sum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In equal monthly installments of from thirty-six to two hundred and forty in number, in multiples of twelve.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In equal monthly installments for one hundred and twenty months certain with such payments continuing during the remaining lifetime of the first beneficiary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) As a refund life income in monthly installments payable for such period certain as may be required in order that the sum of the installments certain, including a last installment of such reduced amount as may be necessary, shall equal the face value of the contract, less any indebtedness, with such payments continuing throughout the lifetime of the first beneficiary; however, such optional settlement shall not be available in any case in which such settlement would result in payments of installments over a shorter period than one hundred and twenty months.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Except as provided in the second and third sentences of this subsection, unless the insured elects some other mode of settlement, such insurance shall be payable to the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries in thirty-six equal monthly installments. The first beneficiary may elect to receive payment under any option which provides for payment over a longer period of time than the option elected by the insured, or if no option has been elected by the insured, in excess of thirty-six months. In the case of insurance maturing after September 30, 1981, and for which no option has been elected by the insured, the first beneficiary may elect to receive payment in one sum. If the option selected requires payment to any one beneficiary of monthly installments of less than $10, the amount payable to such beneficiary shall be paid in such maximum number of monthly installments as are a multiple of twelve as will provide a monthly installment of not less than $10. If the present value of the amount payable at the time any person initially becomes entitled to payment thereof is not sufficient to pay at least twelve monthly installments of not less than $10 each, such amount shall be payable in one sum. Options (3) and (4) shall not be available if any firm, corporation, legal entity (including the estate of the insured), or trustee is beneficiary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If the beneficiary of such insurance is entitled to a lump-sum settlement but elects some other mode of settlement and dies before receiving all the benefits due and payable under such mode of settlement, the present value of the remaining unpaid amount shall be payable to the estate of the beneficiary. If no beneficiary is designated by the insured, or if the designated beneficiary does not survive the insured, or if a designated beneficiary not entitled to a lump-sum settlement survives the insured, and dies before receiving all the benefits due and payable, then the commuted value of the remaining unpaid insurance (whether accrued or not) shall be paid in one sum to the estate of the insured. In no event shall there be any payment to the estate of the insured or of the beneficiary of any sums unless it is shown that any sums paid will not escheat.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Under such regulations as the Secretary may promulgate, the cash surrender value of any policy of insurance or the proceeds of an endowment contract which matures by reason of completion of the endowment period may be paid to the insured under option (2) or (4) of this section. All settlements under option (4), how<!-- PDFPage:244 -->ever, shall be calculated on the basis of The Annuity Table for 1949. If the option selected requires payment of monthly installments of less than $10, the amount payable shall be paid in such maximum number of monthly installments as are a multiple of twelve as will provide a monthly installment of not less than $10.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1920. National Service Life Insurance Fund</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The National Service Life Insurance Fund heretofore created in the Treasury is continued as a permanent trust fund. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, all premiums paid on account of National Service Life Insurance shall be deposited and covered into the Treasury to the credit of such fund, which, together with interest earned thereon, shall be available for the payment of liabilities under such insurance, including payment of dividends and refunds of unearned premiums, and for the reimbursement of administrative costs under subsection (c). Payments from this fund shall be made upon and in accordance with awards by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary is authorized to set aside out of such fund such reserve amounts as may be required under accepted actuarial principles to meet all liabilities under such insurance; and the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to invest and reinvest such fund, or any part thereof, in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and to sell such obligations for the purposes of such fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) For each fiscal year for which this subsection is in effect, the Secretary shall, from the National Service Life Insurance Fund, reimburse the &ldquo;General operating expenses&rdquo; account of the Department for the amount of administrative costs determined under paragraph (2) for that fiscal year. Such reimbursement shall be made from any surplus earnings for that fiscal year that are available for dividends on such insurance after claims have been paid and actuarially determined reserves have been set aside. However, if the amount of such administrative costs exceeds the amount of such surplus earnings, such reimbursement shall be made only to the extent of such surplus earnings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall determine the administrative costs to the Department for a fiscal year for which this subsection is in effect which, in the judgment of the Secretary, are properly allocable to the provision of National Service Life Insurance (and to the provision of any total disability income insurance added to the provision of such insurance).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection shall be in effect only with respect to fiscal year 1996.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The United States shall bear the excess mortality cost and the cost of waiver of premiums on account of total disability traceable to the extra hazard of military or naval service, as such hazard may be determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Whenever benefits under insurance become payable because of the death of the insured as the result of disease or injury traceable to the extra hazard of military or naval service, as such hazard may be determined by the Secretary, the liability for payment of such benefits shall be borne by the United States in an amount which, when added to the reserve of the policy at the time of death of the insured will equal the then value of such benefits under such policy. Where life contingencies are involved in the calculation of the value of such benefits of insurance heretofore or hereafter matured, the calculation of such liability or liabilities shall be based upon such mortality table or tables as the Secretary may prescribe with interest at the rate of 3 per centum per annum. The Secretary shall transfer from time to time from the National Service Life Insurance appropriation to the National Service Life Insurance Fund such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Whenever the premiums under insurance are waived because of the total disability of the insured as the result of disease or injury traceable to the extra hazard of military or naval service, as such hazard may be determined by <!-- PDFPage:246 -->the Secretary, the premiums so waived shall be paid by the United States and the Secretary shall transfer from time to time an amount equal to the amount of such premiums from the National Service Life Insurance appropriation to the National Service Life Insurance Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Whenever benefits under the total disability income provision become, or have become, payable because of total disability of the insured as a result of disease or injury traceable to the extra hazard of the military or naval service, as such hazard may be determined by the Secretary, the liability shall be borne by the United States, and the Secretary shall transfer from the National Service Life Insurance appropriation to the National Service Life Insurance Fund from time to time any amounts which become, or have become, payable to the insured on account of such total disability, and to transfer from the National Service Life Insurance Fund to the National Service Life Insurance appropriation the amount of the reserve held on account of the total disability benefit. When a person receiving such payments on account of total disability recovers from such disability, and is then entitled to continue protection under the total disability income provision, the Secretary shall transfer to the National Service Life Insurance Fund a sum sufficient to set up the then required reserve on such total disability benefit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Any disability for which a waiver was required as a condition to tendering a person a commission under Public Law 816, Seventy-seventh Congress, shall be deemed to be a disability resulting from an injury or disease traceable to the extra hazard of military or naval service for the purpose of applying this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1922. Service disabled veterans&rsquo; insurance</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Any person who is released from active military, naval, or air service, under other than dishonorable conditions on or after April 25, 1951, and is found by the Secretary to be suffering from a disability or disabilities for which compensation would be payable if 10 per centum or more in degree and except for which such person would be insurable according to the standards of good health established by the Secretary, shall, upon application in writing made within two years from the date service-connection of such disability is determined by the Secretary and payment of premiums as provided in this subchapter, be granted insurance by the United States against the death of such person occurring while such insurance is in force. If such a person is shown by evidence satisfactory to the Secretary to have been mentally incompetent during any part of the two-year period, application for insurance under this section may be filed within two years after a guardian is appointed or within two years after the removal of such disability as determined by the Secretary, whichever is the earlier date. If the guardian was appointed or the removal of the disability occurred before January 1, 1959, application for insurance under this section may be made within two years after that date. Insurance granted under this section shall be issued upon the same terms and conditions as are contained in the standard policies of National Service Life Insurance except (1) the premium rates for such insurance shall be based on the Commissioners 1941 Standard Ordinary Table of Mortality and interest at the rate of 21/4 per centum per annum; (2) all cash, loan, paid-up, and extended values shall be based upon the Commissioners 1941 Standard Ordinary Table of Mortality and interest at the rate of 21/4 per centum per annum; (3) all settlements on policies involving annuities shall be calculated on the basis of The Annuity Table for 1949, and interest at the rate of 21/4 per centum per annum; (4) insurance granted under this section shall be on a nonparticipating basis and all premiums and other collections therefor shall be credited directly to a revolving fund in the Treasury of the United States, and any payments on such insurance shall be made directly from such fund. Appropriations to such fund are hereby authorized. As to insurance issued under this section, waiver of premiums pursuant to section 602(n) of the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940 and section 1912 of this title shall not be denied on the ground that the service-connected disability became total before the effective date of such insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Any person who, on or after April 25, 1951, was otherwise qualified for insurance under the provisions of section 620 of the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940, or under subsection (a) of this section, but who did not apply for such insurance and who is shown by evidence satisfactory to the Secretary (A) to have been mentally incompetent from a service-connected disability, (i) at the time of release from active service, or (ii) during any part of the two-year period from the date the service connection of a disability is first determined by the Secretary, or (iii) after release from active service but is not rated service-connected disabled by the Secretary until after death; and (B) to have remained continuously so mentally incompetent until date of death; and (C) to have died before the appointment of a guardian, or within two years after the appointment of a guardian; shall be deemed to have applied for and to have been granted such insurance, as of the date of death, in an amount which, together with any other United States Government or National Service life insurance in force, shall aggregate $10,000. The date to be used for determining whether such person was insurable according to the <!-- PDFPage:247 -->standards of good health established by the Secretary, except for the service-connected disability, shall be the date of release from active service or the date the person became mentally incompetent, whichever is the later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Payments of insurance granted under subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be made only to the following beneficiaries and in the order named&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to the widow or widower of the insured, if living and while unremarried;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if no widow or widower entitled thereto, to the child or children of the insured, if living, in equal shares;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) if no widow or widower or child entitled thereto, to the parent or parents of the insured who last bore that relationship, if living, in equal shares.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No application for insurance payments under this subsection shall be valid unless filed with the Secretary within two years after the date of death of the insured or before January 1, 1961, whichever is the later, and the relationship of the applicant shall be proved as of the date of death of the insured by evidence satisfactory to the Secretary. Persons shown by evidence satisfactory to the Secretary to have been mentally or legally incompetent at the time the right to apply for death benefits expires, may make such application at any time within one year after the removal of such disability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding section 1917 of this title, insurance under this subsection shall be payable to the beneficiary determined under paragraph (2) of this subsection in a lump sum.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Insurance heretofore granted under the provisions of section 621 of the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940, against the death of the policyholder occurring while such insurance is in force, is subject to the same terms and conditions as are contained in standard policies of National Service Life Insurance on the five-year level premium term plan except (1) such insurance may not be exchanged for or converted to insurance on any other plan; (2) the premium rates for such insurance shall be based on the Commissioners 1941 Standard Ordinary Table of Mortality and interest at the rate of 21/4 per centum per annum; (3) all settlements on policies involving annuities shall be calculated on the basis of The Annuity Table for 1949, and interest at the rate of 21/4 per centum per annum; (4) all premiums and other collections on such insurance and any total disability provisions added thereto shall be credited to a revolving fund in the Treasury of the United States, which, together with interest earned thereon, shall be available for the payment of liabilities under such insurance and any total disability provisions added thereto, including payments of dividends and refunds of unearned premiums, and for the reimbursement of administrative costs under subsection (d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Any term insurance heretofore issued under section 621 of the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940, may be converted to a permanent plan of insurance or exchanged for a policy of limited convertible five-year level premium term insurance issued under this subsection. Insurance issued under this subsection shall be issued upon the same terms and conditions as are contained in the standard policies of National Service Life Insurance except (1) after September 1, 1960, limited convertible term insurance may not be issued or renewed on the term plan after the insured's fiftieth birthday; (2) the premium rates for such limited convertible term or permanent plan insurance shall be based on table X&ndash;18 (1950&ndash;54 Intercompany Table of Mortality) and interest at the rate of 21/2 per centum per annum; (3) all settlements on policies involving annuities on insurance issued under this subsection shall be calculated on the basis of The Annuity Table for 1949, and interest at the rate of 21/2 per centum per annum; (4) all cash, loan, paid-up, and extended values, and, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, all other calculations in connection with insurance issued under this subsection shall be based on table X&ndash;18 (1950&ndash;54 Intercompany Table of Mortality) and interest at the rate of 21/2 per centum per annum; (5) all premiums and other collections on insurance issued under this subsection and any total disability income provisions added thereto shall be credited directly to the revolving fund referred to in subsection (a) of this section, which together with interest earned thereon, shall be available for the payment of liabilities under such insurance and any total disability provisions added thereto, including payments of dividends and refunds of unearned premiums.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary is authorized to invest in, and the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to sell and retire, special interest-bearing obligations of the United States for the account of the revolving fund with a maturity date as may be agreed upon by the two Secretaries. The rate of interest on such obligations shall be fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury at a rate equal to the rate of interest, computed as of the end of the month preceding the date of issue of such obligations, borne by all marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt that are not due or callable until after the expiration of five years from the date of original issue; except that where such average rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest of such obligations shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum nearest such average rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) For each fiscal year for which this subsection is in effect, the Secretary shall, from the Veterans&rsquo; Special Life Insurance Fund, reimburse the &ldquo;General operating expenses&rdquo; account of the Department for the amount of administrative costs determined under paragraph (2) for <!-- PDFPage:249 -->that fiscal year. Such reimbursement shall be made from any surplus earnings for that fiscal year that are available for dividends on such insurance after claims have been paid and actuarially determined reserves have been set aside. However, if the amount of such administrative costs exceeds the amount of such surplus earnings, such reimbursement shall be made only to the extent of such surplus earnings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall determine the administrative costs to the Department for a fiscal year for which this subsection is in effect which, in the judgment of the Secretary, are properly allocable to the provision of Veterans&rsquo; Special Life Insurance (and to the provision of any total disability income insurance added to the provision of such insurance).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection shall be in effect only with respect to fiscal year 1996.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1924. In-service waiver of premiums</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Waiver of all premiums on five-year level premium term insurance and that portion of any permanent insurance premiums representing the cost of the pure insurance risk, as determined by the Secretary, granted on National Service Life Insurance or United States Government life insurance under section 622 of the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940 and in effect on January 1, 1959, shall, unless canceled, continue in effect according to the provisions of such section for the remainder of the insured's continuous active service and for one hundred and twenty days thereafter. Such premium waiver renders the contract of insurance nonparticipating during the period the waiver is in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Whenever benefits become payable because of the maturity of such insurance while under the premium waiver continued by this section, liability for payment of such benefits shall be borne by the United States in an amount which, when added to any reserve of the policy at the <!-- PDFPage:250 -->time of maturity, will equal the then value of such benefits under such policy. Where life contingencies are involved in the calculation of the value of such benefits, the calculation of such liability or liabilities shall be based upon such mortality table or tables as the Secretary may prescribe with interest at the rate of 21/4 per centum per annum as to insurance issued under sections 620 and 621 of the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940, at the rate of 3 per centum per annum as to other National Service Life Insurance, and 31/2 per centum per annum as to United States Government life insurance. The Secretary shall transfer from time to time from the National Service Life Insurance appropriation to the National Service Life Insurance Fund and from the military and naval insurance appropriation to the United States Government Life Insurance Fund such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In any case in which insurance continued in force under this section matures on or after January 1, 1972, an amount equal to the amount of premiums, less dividends, waived on and after that date shall be placed as an indebtedness against the insurance and, unless otherwise paid, shall be deducted from the proceeds. In such case, the liability of the Government under subsection (b) of this section shall be reduced by the amount so deducted from the proceeds.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Any person (other than a person referred to in subsection (f) of this section) heretofore eligible to apply for National Service Life Insurance after October 7, 1940, and before January 1, 1957, who is found by the Secretary to be suffering (1) from a service-connected disability or disabilities for which compensation would be payable if 10 percent or more in degree and except for which such person would be insurable according to the standards of good health established by the Secretary; or (2) from a non-service-connected disability which renders such person uninsurable according to the standards of good health established by the Secretary and such person establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such person is unable to obtain commercial life insurance at a substandard rate, shall, upon application in writing made before May 2, 1966, compliance with the health requirements of this section and payment of the required premiums, be granted insurance under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If, notwithstanding the applicant's service-connected disability, such person is insurable according to the standards of good health established by the Secretary, the insurance granted under this section shall be issued upon the same terms and conditions as are contained in the standard policies of National Service Life Insurance except (1) five-year level premium term insurance may not be issued; (2) the net premium rates shall be based on the 1958 Commissioners Standard Ordinary Basic Mortality Table, increased at the time of issue by such an amount as the Secretary determines to be necessary for sound actuarial operations, and thereafter such premiums may be adjusted as the Secretary determines to be so necessary but at intervals of not less than two years; (3) an additional premium to cover administrative costs to the Government as determined by the Secretary at times of issue shall be charged for insurance issued under this subsection and for any total disability income provision attached thereto, and thereafter such costs may be adjusted as the Secretary determines to be necessary but at intervals of not less than five years; (4) all cash, loan, extended and paid-up insurance values shall be based on the 1958 Commissioners Standard Ordinary Basic Mortality Table; (5) all settlements on policies involving annuities shall be calculated on the basis of The Annuity Table for 1949; (6) all calculations in connection with insurance issued under this subsection shall be based on interest at the rate of 31/2 percent per annum; and (7) the insurance shall include such other changes in terms and conditions as the Secretary determines to be reasonable and practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If the applicant's service-connected disability or disabilities render the applicant uninsurable according to the standards of good health established by the Secretary, or if the applicant has a non-service-connected disability which renders the applicant uninsurable according to the standards of good health established by the Secretary and such person establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such person is unable to obtain commercial life insurance at a substandard rate and such uninsurability existed as of the date of approval of this section, the insurance granted under this section shall be issued upon the same terms and conditions as are contained in standard policies of National Service Life Insurance, except (1) five-year level <!-- PDFPage:251 -->premium term insurance may not be issued; (2) the premiums charged for the insurance issued under this subsection shall be increased at the time of issue by such an amount as the Secretary determines to be necessary for sound actuarial operations and thereafter such premiums may be adjusted from time to time as the Secretary determines to be necessary; for the purpose of any increase at time of issue or later adjustment the service-connected group and the non-service-connected group may be separately classified; (3) an additional premium to cover administrative costs to the Government as determined by the Secretary at the time of issue shall be charged for insurance issued under this subsection and for any total disability income provision attached thereto (for which the insured may subsequently become eligible) and thereafter such costs may be adjusted as the Secretary determines to be necessary but at intervals of not less than five years and for this purpose the service-connected and non-service-connected can be separately classified; (4) all settlements on policies involving annuities shall be calculated on the basis of The Annuity Table for 1949; (5) all calculations in connection with insurance issued under this subsection shall be based on interest at the rate of 31/2 percent per annum; and (6) the insurance shall include such other changes in terms and conditions as the Secretary determines to be reasonable and practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) All premiums and collections on insurance issued pursuant to this section and any total disability income provision attached thereto shall be credited to the Veterans Reopened Insurance Fund, a revolving fund established in the Treasury of the United States, and all payments on such insurance and any total disability provision attached thereto, including payments of dividends and refunds of unearned premiums, shall be made from that fund and the interest earned on the assets of that fund. For actuarial and accounting purposes, the assets and liabilities (including liabilities for repayment of advances hereinafter authorized, and adjustment of premiums) attributable to the insured groups established under this section shall be separately determined. Such amounts in the Veterans Special Term Insurance Fund in the Treasury, not exceeding $1,650,000 in the aggregate, as may hereafter be determined by the Secretary to be in excess of the actuarial liabilities of that fund, including contingency reserves, shall be available for transfer to the Veterans Reopened Insurance Fund as needed to provide initial capital. Any amounts so transferred shall be repaid to the Treasury over a reasonable period of time with interest as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the average yield on all marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States of comparable maturities then forming a part of the public debt.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary is authorized to set aside out of the revolving fund established under this section such reserve amounts as may be required under accepted actuarial principles to meet all liabilities on insurance issued under this section and any total disability income provision attached thereto. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to invest in and to sell and retire special interest-bearing obligations of the United States for the account of the revolving fund. Such obligations issued for this purpose shall have maturities fixed with due regard for the needs of the fund and shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average market yield (computed by the Secretary of the Treasury on the basis of market quotations as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of issue) on all marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt which are not due or callable until after the expiration of four years from the end of such calendar month; except that where such average market yield is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 percent, the rate of interest of such obligation shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 percent nearest such market yield.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1982 of this title, the Secretary shall, from time to time, determine the administrative costs to the Government which in the Secretary's judgment are properly allocable to insurance issued under this section and any total disability income provision attached thereto, and shall transfer from the revolving fund, the amount of such cost allocable to the Department to the appropriation &ldquo;General Operating Expenses, Department of Veterans Affairs&rdquo;, and the remainder of such cost to the general fund receipts in the Treasury. The initial administrative costs of issuing insurance under this section and any total disability income provision attached thereto shall be so transferred over such period of time as the Secretary determines to be reasonable and practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1982 of this title, a medical examination (including any supplemental examination or tests) when required of an applicant for issuance of insurance under this section or any total disability income provisions attached thereto shall be at the applicant's own expense by a duly licensed physician.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) No insurance shall be granted under this section to any person referred to in section 107 of this title or to any person while on active duty or active duty for training under a call or order to such duty for a period of thirty-one days or more.</p>

Provision shall be made for reconversion of any such policies to a higher premium rate or, upon proof of good health satisfactory to the Secretary, to a lower premium rate, in accordance with regulations to be issued by the Secretary. No reconversion shall be made to a five-year level premium term policy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) An insured who on or after the insured's sixty-fifth birthday has a five-year level premium term policy of insurance in force by payment of premiums may exchange such policy for insurance on a special endowment at age ninety-six plan upon written application; payment of the required premium; and surrender of the five-year level premium term policy and any total disability provision attached thereto with all rights, title, and interests thereunder. However, if it is found by the Secretary subsequent to the exchange that prior thereto the term policy matured because of total permanent disability of the insured or that the insured was entitled to total disability benefits under the total disability provision attached to such policy, the insured, upon surrender of the special endowment at age ninety-six policy and any provision for waiver of premiums issued under subsection (c) of this section with all rights, title, and interest thereunder, will be entitled to benefits payable under the prior contract. In such case, the cash value less any indebtedness on the endowment policy shall be refunded together with any premiums paid on a provision for waiver of premiums. Insurance on the special endowment at age ninety-six plan shall be issued at the attained age of the insured upon the same terms and conditions as are contained in standard policies of United States Government Life Insurance except:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary shall, upon application made by the insured at the same time as the insured exchanges the term policy for an endowment policy issued under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, and upon payment of such extra premium as the Secretary shall prescribe, include in such endowment policy a provision for waiver of premiums on the policy and on the provision during the total permanent disability of the insured, if such disability began after the date of such application and while the policy and the provision are in force by payment of premiums. The Secretary shall not grant waiver of any premium becoming due more than one year before receipt by the Secretary of claim for the same, except as provided in this subsection. Any premiums paid for months during which waiver is effective shall be refunded. The Secretary shall provide by regulations for examination or reexamination of an insured claiming waiver of premiums under this subsection, and may deny waiver for failure to cooperate. If it is found that an insured is no longer totally and permanently disabled, the waiver of premiums shall cease as of the date of such finding and the policy and provision may be continued by payment of premiums as provided therein. In any case in which the Secretary finds that the insured's failure to make timely claim for waiver of premiums, or to submit satisfactory evidence of the existence or continuance of total permanent disability was due to circumstances beyond the insured's control, the Secretary may grant waiver or continuance of waiver of premiums. If the insured dies without filing claim for waiver, the beneficiary, within one year after the death of the insured, or, if the beneficiary is insane or a minor, within one year after removal of such legal disability, may file claim for waiver with evidence of the insured's right to waiver under this subsection. Policies containing a provision for waiver of premiums issued under this subsection may be separately classified for the purpose of dividend distribution from otherwise similar policies not containing such provision.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1948. Total disability provision</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall include in United States Government life insurance policies provision whereby an insured, who is totally disabled as a result of disease or injury for a period of four consecutive months or more before attaining the age of sixty-five years and before default in payment of any premium, shall be paid disability benefits at the rate of $5.75 monthly for each $1,000 of insurance in force when total disability benefits become payable. The amount of such monthly payment under the provisions of this section shall not be reduced because of payment of permanent and total disability benefits under the insurance policy. Such payments shall be effective as of the first day of the fifth consecutive month, and shall be made monthly during the continuance of such total disability. Such payments shall be concurrent with or independent of permanent and total disability benefits under the insurance policy. In addition to the monthly disability benefits the payment of premiums on the life insurance and for the total disability benefits authorized by this section shall be waived during the continuance of such total disability. Regulations shall provide for reexaminations of beneficiaries under this section; and, in the event that it is found that an insured is no longer totally disabled, the waiver of premiums and payment of benefits shall cease and the insurance policy, including the total disability provision, may be continued by payment of premiums as provided in said policy and the total disability provision. Neither the dividends nor the amount payable in any settlement under any United States Government life insurance policy shall be decreased because of disability benefits granted under the provisions of this section. The payment of total disability benefits shall not prejudice the right of any insured, who is totally and permanently disabled, to permanent and total disability benefits under the insured's insurance policy. The provision authorized by this section shall not be included in any United States Government life insurance policy heretofore or hereafter issued, except upon application, payment of premium by the insured, and proof of good health satisfactory to the Secretary. The benefit granted under this section shall be on the basis of multiples of $500, and not less than $1,000 or more than the amount of insurance in force at time of application. The Secretary shall determine the amount of the monthly premium to cover the benefits of this section, and in order to continue such benefits in force the monthly premiums shall be payable until the insured attains the age of sixty-five years or until the prior maturity of the policy. In all other respects such monthly premium shall be payable under the same terms and conditions as the regular monthly premium on the United States Government life insurance policy.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary may provide in insurance contracts for optional settlements, to be selected by the insured, whereby such insurance may be made payable either in one sum or in installments for thirty-six months or more. A provision may also be included in such contracts authorizing the beneficiary to elect to receive payment of the insurance in installments for thirty-six months or more, but only if the insured has not exercised the right of election as provided in this subchapter. Even though the insured may have exercised the right of election the beneficiary may elect to receive such insurance in installments spread over a greater period of time than that selected by the insured. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any insurance contract, the beneficiary may, in the case of insurance maturing after September 30, 1981, and for which the insured has not exercised the right of election of the insured as provided in this subchapter, elect to receive payment of the insurance in one sum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Under such regulations as the Secretary may promulgate, the cash surrender value of any policy of insurance or the proceeds of an endowment contract which matures by reason of completion of the endowment period may be paid to the insured (1) in equal monthly installments of from thirty-six to two hundred and forty in number, in multiples of twelve; or (2) as a refund life income in monthly installments payable for such periods certain as may be required in order that the sum of the installments certain, including a last installment of such reduced amount as may be necessary, shall equal the cash value of the contract, less any indebtedness, with such payments continuing throughout the lifetime of the insured. However, all settlements under option (2) above shall be calculated on the basis of The Annuity Table for 1949. If the option selected requires payment of monthly installments of less than $10, the amount payable shall be paid in such maximum number of monthly installments as are a multiple of twelve as will provide a monthly installment of not less than $10.</p>

Payments from this fund shall be made upon and in accordance with awards by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Whenever benefits under United States Government life insurance become, or have become, payable because of total permanent disability of the insured or because of the death of the insured as a result of disease or injury traceable to the extra hazard of the military or naval service, as such hazard may be determined by the Secretary, the liability shall be borne by the United States. In such cases the Secretary shall transfer from the military and naval insurance appropriation to the United States Government Life Insurance Fund a sum which, together with the reserve of the policy at the time of maturity by total permanent disability or death, will equal the then value of such benefits. When a person receiving total permanent disability benefits under a United States Government life insurance policy recovers from such disability and is then entitled to continue a reduced amount of insurance, the Secretary shall transfer to the military and naval insurance appropriation all of the loss reserve to the credit of such policy claim except a sum sufficient to set up the then required reserve on the reduced amount of the insurance that may be continued, which sum shall be retained in the United States Government Life Insurance Fund for the purpose of such reserve.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Whenever benefits under the total disability provision become, or have become, payable because of total disability of the insured as a result of disease or injury traceable to the extra hazard of the military or naval service, as such hazard may be determined by the Secretary, the liability shall be borne by the United States, and the Secretary shall transfer from the military and naval insurance appropriation to the United States Government Life Insurance Fund from time to time any amounts which become or have become payable to the insured on account of such total disability, and shall transfer from the United States Government Life Insurance Fund to the military and naval insurance appropriation the amount of the reserve held on account of the total disability benefit. When a person receiving such payments on account of total disability recovers from such disability and is then entitled to continued protection under the total disability provision, the Secretary shall transfer to the United States Government Life Insurance Fund a sum sufficient to set up the then required reserve on such total disability benefit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Any disability for which a waiver was required as a condition to tendering a person a commission under Public Law 816, Seventy-seventh Congress, shall be deemed to be a disability resulting from an injury or disease traceable to the extra hazard of military or naval service for the purpose of applying this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In the event that all provisions of the rules and regulations other than the requirements as to the physical condition of the applicant have been complied with, an application for reinstatement, in whole or in part, of lapsed United States Government life insurance may be approved if made within two years after the date of lapse and if the applicant's disability is the result of an injury or disease, or of an aggravation thereof, suffered or contracted in the active military or naval service during the period beginning April 6, 1917, and ending July 2, 1921, and the applicant during the applicant's lifetime submits proof satisfactory to the Secretary showing that the applicant is not totally and permanently disabled. As a condition to the acceptance of an application for reinstatement under this section, the applicant shall be required to pay all the back monthly premiums which would have become payable if such insurance had not lapsed, together with interest at the rate of 5 per centum per annum, compounded annually, on each premium from the date said premium is due by the terms of the policy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Premium liens established under the provisions of section 304 of the World War Veterans&rsquo; Act, 1924, shall continue to bear interest at the rate of 5 per centum per annum, compounded an<!-- PDFPage:260 -->nually, and will be deducted from any settlement of insurance to which they are attached.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1960. Waiver of premium payments on due date</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary is authorized to provide by regulations for waiving the payment of premiums on United States Government life insurance on the due date thereof and the insurance may be deemed not to lapse in the cases of the following persons: (1) those who are confined in hospital under the Department for a compensable disability during the period while they are so confined; (2) those who are rated as temporarily totally disabled by reason of any injury or disease entitling them to compensation during the period of such total disability and while they are so rated; (3) those who, while mentally incompetent and for whom no legal guardian had been or has been appointed, allowed or may allow their insurance to lapse during the period for which they have been or hereafter may be rated mentally incompetent, or until a guardian has notified the Department of the guardian's qualification, but not later than six months after appointment of a guardian. In mentally incompetent cases the waiver is to be made without application and retroactive when necessary. Relief from payment of premiums on the due date thereof shall be for full calendar months, beginning with the month in which said confinement to hospital, the temporary total disability rating, or the mental incompetency began or begins and ending with that month during the half or major fraction of which such persons are no longer entitled to waiver as provided above.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) All premiums the payment of which when due is waived as provided in this section shall bear interest at the rate of 5 percent per annum, compounded annually, from the due date of each premium, and if not paid by the insured shall be deducted from the insurance in any settlement thereunder, or when the same matures either because of permanent total disability or death. In the event any lien or other indebtedness established by this section or prior corresponding provision of law exists against any policy of United States Government life insurance in excess of the then cash surrender value thereof at the time of the termination of such policy of insurance for any reason other than by death or total permanent disability the Secretary is authorized to transfer and pay from the military and naval insurance appropriation to the United States Government Life Insurance Fund a sum equal to the amount such lien or indebtedness exceeds the then cash surrender value.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the Secretary may from time to time adjust the dollar amount of the monthly installments payable to a beneficiary of United States Government Life Insurance who is receiving the proceeds of such insurance under a life annuity settlement option. The Secretary may make such an adjustment only if the Secretary deter<!-- PDFPage:261 -->mines that the adjustment is administratively and actuarially sound. The Secretary may make such an adjustment without regard to the provisions of section 1944 of this title with respect to interest rates and the use of mortality tables.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary shall determine the amount in the trust fund in the Treasury held for payment of proceeds to United States Government Life Insurance beneficiaries attributable to interest and mortality gains on the reserves held for annuity accounts. Such amount shall be available for distribution to the life annuitants referred to in subsection (a) of this section as a fixed percentage of, and in addition to, the monthly installment amount to which the annuitants are entitled under this subchapter. For the purposes of this section, gains on the reserves are defined as funds attributable solely to annuity accounts that are in excess of actuarial liabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The monthly amount of an annuity authorized in section 1944 of this title, as adjusted under this section, may not be less than the monthly amount of such annuity that would otherwise be applicable without regard to this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) During any period in which a member, on active duty or active duty for training under a call or order to such duty that does not specify a period of less than thirty-one days, is insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance, there shall be deducted each month from the member's basic or other pay until separation or release from such duty an amount determined by the Secretary (which shall be the same for all such members) as the share of the cost attributable to insuring such member under such policy, less any costs traceable to the extra hazard of such duty in the uniformed service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) During any month in which a member is assigned to the Ready Reserve of a uniformed service under conditions which meet the qualifications of section 1965(5)(B) of this title, and is insured under a policy of insurance purchased by the Secretary, under section 1966 of this title, <!-- PDFPage:269 -->there shall be contributed from the appropriation made for active duty pay of the uniformed service concerned an amount determined by the Secretary (which shall be the same for all such members) as the share of the cost attributable to insuring such member under this policy, less any costs traceable to the extra hazards of such duty in the uniformed services. Any amounts so contributed on behalf of any individual shall be collected by the Secretary concerned from such individual (by deduction from pay or otherwise) and shall be credited to the appropriation from which such contribution was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If an individual who is required pursuant to subparagraph (A) to make a direct remittance of costs to the Secretary concerned fails to make the required remittance within 60 days of the date on which such remittance is due, such individual's insurance with respect to which such remittance is required shall be terminated by the Secretary concerned. Such termination shall be made by written notice to the individual's official address and shall be effective 60 days after the date of such notice. Such termination of insurance may be vacated if, before the effective date of termination, the individual remits all amounts past due for such insurance and demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary concerned that the failure to make timely remittances was justifiable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) During any fiscal year, or portion thereof, that a member is on active duty or active duty for training under a call or order to such duty that specifies a period of less than thirty-one days, or is authorized or required to perform inactive duty training scheduled in advance by competent authority, and is insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance, the Secretary concerned shall collect from the member (by deduction from pay or otherwise) an amount determined by the Secretary (which shall be the same for all such members) as the share of the cost attributable to insuring such member under such policy, less any costs traceable to the extra hazard of such duty in the uniformed service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any amount not deducted from the basic or other pay of a member insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance, or collected from the member by the Secretary concerned, if not otherwise paid, shall be deducted from the proceeds of any insurance thereafter payable. The initial monthly amount under paragraph (1) or (2) hereof, or fiscal year amount under paragraph (3) hereof, determined by the Secretary to be charged under this section for Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance may be continued from year to year, except that the Secretary may redetermine such monthly or fiscal year amounts from time to time in accordance with experience. No refunds will be made to any member of any amount properly deducted from the member's basic or other pay, or collected from the member by the Secretary concerned, to cover the insurance granted under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) For each month for which any member is so insured, there shall be contributed from the appropriation made for active duty pay of the uniformed service concerned an amount determined by the Secretary and certified to the Secretary concerned to be the cost of Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance which is traceable to the extra hazard of duty in the uniformed services. Effective January 1, 1970, such cost shall be determined by the Secretary on the basis of the excess mortality incurred by members and former members of the uniformed services insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance above what their mortality would have been under peacetime conditions as such mortality is determined by the Secretary using such methods and data as the Secretary shall determine to be reasonable and practicable. The Secretary is authorized to make such adjustments regarding contributions from pay appropriations as may be indicated from actual experience.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) An amount equal to the first amount due on Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance may be advanced from current appropriations for active-service pay to any such member, which amount shall constitute a lien upon any service or other pay accruing to the person from whom such advance was made and shall be collected therefrom if not otherwise paid. No disbursing or certifying officer shall be responsible for any loss incurred by reason of such advance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The sums withheld from the basic or other pay of members, or collected from them by the Secretary concerned, under subsection (a) of this section, and the sums contributed from appropriations under subsection (b) of this section, together with the income derived from any dividends or premium rate adjustments received from insurers shall be deposited to the credit of a revolving fund established in the Treasury of the United States. All premium payments and extra hazard costs on Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance and the administrative cost to the Department of insurance issued under this subchapter shall be paid from the revolving fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary is authorized to set aside out of the revolving fund such amounts as may be required to meet the administrative costs to the Department of insurance issued under this subchapter and all current premium payments and extra hazard costs on any insurance policy or policies purchased under section 1966 of this title. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to invest in and to sell and retire special interest-bearing obligations of the United States for the account of the revolving fund. Such obligations issued for this purpose shall have maturities fixed with due regard for the needs of the fund and shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average market yield (computed by the Secretary of the Treasury on the basis of market quotations as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of issue) on all marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt which are not due or callable until after the expiration of four years from the end of such calendar month; except that where such average market yield is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest of such obligation shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum nearest such market yield.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1982 of this title, the Secretary shall, from time to time, determine the administrative costs to <!-- PDFPage:270 -->the Department which in the Secretary's judgment are properly allocable to insurance issued under this subchapter and shall transfer such cost from the revolving fund to the appropriation &ldquo;General Operating Expenses, Department of Veterans Affairs&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations for the administration of the functions of the Secretaries of the military departments under this section. Such regulations shall prescribe such procedures as the Secretary of Defense, after consultation with the Secretary, may consider necessary to ensure that such functions are carried out in a timely and complete manner and in accordance with the provisions of this section, including specifically the provisions of subsection (a)(2) of this section relating to contributions from appropriations made for active duty pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) No tax, fee, or other monetary payment may be imposed or collected by any State, or by any political subdivision or other governmental authority of a State, on or with respect to any premium paid under an insurance policy purchased under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be construed to exempt any company issuing a policy of insurance under this subchapter from the imposition, payment, or collection of a tax, fee, or other monetary payment on the net income or profit accruing to or realized by that company from business conducted under this subchapter, if that tax, fee, or payment is applicable to a broad range of business activity.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1970. Beneficiaries; payment of insurance</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Any amount of insurance under this subchapter in force on any member or former member on the date of the insured's death shall be paid, upon the establishment of a valid claim therefor, to the person or persons surviving at the date of the insured's death, in the following order of precedence:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">First, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries as the member or former member may have designated by a writing received prior to death (1) in the uniformed services if insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance, or (2) in the administrative office established under section 1966(b) of this title if separated or released from service, or if assigned to the Retired Reserve, and insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance, or if insured under Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Second, if there be no such beneficiary, to the widow or widower of such member or former member;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Third, if none of the above, to the child or children of such member or former member and descendants of deceased children by representation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Fourth, if none of the above, to the parents of such member or former member or the survivor of them;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Fifth, if none of the above, to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of such member or former member;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Sixth, if none of the above, to other next of kin of such member or former member entitled under the laws of domicile of such member or former member at the time of the insured's death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If any person otherwise entitled to payment under this section does not make claim therefor within one year after the death of the member or former member, or if payment to such person within that period is prohibited by Federal statute or regulation, payment may be made in the order of precedence as if such person had predeceased the member or former member, and any such payment shall be a bar to recovery by any other person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If, within two years after the death of the member or former member, no claim for payment has been filed by any person entitled under the order of precedence set forth in this section, and neither the Secretary nor the administrative office established by the insurance company or companies pursuant to section 1966(b) of this title has received any notice that any such claim will be made, payment may be made to a claimant as may in the judgment of the Secretary be equitably entitled thereto, and such payment shall be a bar to recovery by any other person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The member may elect settlement of insurance under this subchapter either in a lump sum or in thirty-six equal monthly installments. If no such election is made by the member the beneficiary or beneficiaries may elect settlement either in a lump sum or in thirty-six equal monthly installments. If the member has elected settlement in a lump sum, the beneficiary or beneficiaries may elect settlement in thirty-six equal monthly installments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Until and unless otherwise changed, a beneficiary designation and settlement option filed by a member with the member's uniformed service under prior provisions of law will be effective with respect to the increased insurance authorized under the Veterans&rsquo; Insurance Act of 1974 <!-- PDFPage:272 -->and the insurance shall be settled in the same proportionate amount as the portion designated for such beneficiary or beneficiaries bore to the amount of insurance heretofore in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, payment of matured Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance or Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance benefits may be made directly to a minor widow or widower on his or her own behalf, and payment in such case shall be a complete acquittance to the insurer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Any payments due or to become due under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance or Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance made to, or on account of, an insured or a beneficiary shall be exempt from taxation, shall be exempt from the claims of creditors, and shall not be liable to attachment, levy, or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatever, either before or after receipt by the beneficiary. The preceding sentence shall not apply to (1) collection of amounts not deducted from the member's pay, or collected from him by the Secretary concerned under section 1969(a) of this title, (2) levy under subchapter D of chapter 64 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6331 et seq.) (relating to the seizure of property for collection of taxes), and (3) the taxation of any property purchased in part or wholly out of such payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Insurance payable under this subchapter may not be paid in any amount to the extent that such amount would escheat to a State. Payment of insurance under this subchapter may not be made to the estate of the insured or the estate of any beneficiary of the insured unless it is affirmatively shown that any amount to be paid will not escheat to a State. Any amount to be paid under this subchapter shall be reduced to the extent necessary to comply with this subsection.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1971. Basic tables of premiums; readjustment of rates</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Each policy or policies purchased under section 1966 of this title shall include for the <!-- PDFPage:273 -->first policy year a schedule of basic premium rates by age which the Secretary shall have determined on a basis consistent with the lowest schedule of basic premium rates generally charged for new group life insurance policies issued to large employers, this schedule of basic premium rates by age to be applied, except as otherwise provided in this section, to the distribution by age of the amount of group life insurance under the policy at its date of issue to determine an average basic premium per $1,000 of insurance. Each policy so purchased shall also include provisions whereby the basic rates of premium determined for the first policy year shall be continued for subsequent policy years, except that they may be readjusted for any subsequent year, based on the experience under the policy, such readjustment to be made by the insurance company or companies issuing the policy on a basis determined by the Secretary in advance of such year to be consistent with the general practice of life insurance companies under policies of group life insurance issued to large employers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The total premiums for Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance shall be the sum of the amounts computed according to the provisions of subsection (a) above and the estimated cost traceable to the extra hazard of active duty in the uniformed services as determined by the Secretary, subject to the provision that such estimated costs traceable to the extra hazard shall be retroactively readjusted annually in accordance with section 1969(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Each policy so purchased shall include a provision that, in the event the Secretary determines that ascertaining the actual age distribution of the amounts of group life insurance in force at the date of issue of the policy or at the end of the first or any subsequent year of insurance thereunder would not be possible except at a disproportionately high expense, the Secretary may approve the determination of a tentative average group life premium, for the first or any subsequent policy year, in lieu of using the actual age distribution. Such tentative average premium rate shall be redetermined by the Secretary during any policy year upon request by the insurance company or companies issuing the policy, if experience indicates that the assumptions made in determining the tentative average premium rate for that policy year were incorrect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Each policy so purchased shall contain a provision stipulating the maximum expense and risk charges for the first policy year, which charges shall have been determined by the Secretary on a basis consistent with the general level of such charges made by life insurance companies under policies of group life insurance issued to large employers. Such maximum charges shall be continued from year to year, except that the Secretary may redetermine such maximum charges for any year either by agreement with the insurance company or companies issuing the policy or upon written notice given by the Secretary to such companies at least one year in advance of the beginning of the year for which such redetermined maximum charges will be effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Each such policy shall provide for an accounting to the Secretary not later than ninety days after the end of each policy year, which shall set forth, in a form approved by the Secretary, (1) the amounts of premiums actually accrued under the policy from its date of issue to the end of such policy year, (2) the total of all mortality and other claim charges incurred for that period, and (3) the amounts of the insurers&rsquo; expense and risk charge for that period. Any excess of the total of item (1) over the sum of items (2) and (3) shall be held by the insurance company or companies issuing the policy as a special contingency reserve to be used by such insurance company or companies for charges under such policy only, such reserve to bear interest at a rate to be determined in advance of each policy year by the insurance company or companies issuing the policy, which rate shall be approved by the Secretary as being consistent with the rates generally used by such company or companies for similar funds held under other group life insurance policies. If and when the Secretary determines that such special contingency reserve has attained an amount estimated by the Secretary to make satisfactory provision for adverse fluctuations in future charges under the policy, any further excess shall be deposited to the credit of the revolving fund established under section 1969(d)(1) of this title. If and when such policy is discontinued, and if after all charges have been made, there is any positive balance remaining in such special contingency reserve, such balance shall be deposited to the credit of the revolving fund, subject to the right of the insurance company or companies issuing the policy to make such deposit in equal monthly installments over a period of not more than two years.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1977. Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance shall be issued in the amounts specified in section 1967(a) of this title. In the case of any individual, the amount of Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance may not exceed the amount of Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance coverage continued in force after the expiration of the period of duty or travel under section 1967(b) or 1968(a) of this title. No person may carry a combined amount of Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance and Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance in excess of $200,000 at any one time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If any person insured under Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance again becomes insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance but dies before terminating or converting such person's Veterans&rsquo; Group Insurance, Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance shall be payable only if such person is insured for less than $200,000 under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance, and then only in an amount which, when added to the amount of Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance payable, does not exceed $200,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance shall (1) provide protection against death; (2) be issued on a renewable five-year term basis; (3) have no cash, loan, paid-up, or extended values; (4) except as otherwise provided, lapse for nonpayment of premiums; and (5) contain such other terms and conditions as the Secretary determines to be reasonable and practicable which are not specifically provided for in this section, including any provisions of this subchapter not specifically made inapplicable by the provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The premiums for Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance shall be established under the criteria set forth in sections 1971(a) and (c) of this title, except that the Secretary may provide for average premiums for such various age groupings as the Secretary may decide to be necessary according to sound actuarial principles, and shall include an amount necessary to cover the administrative cost of such insurance to the company or companies issuing such insurance. Such premiums shall be payable by the insureds thereunder as provided by the Secretary directly to the administrative office established for such insurance under section 1966(b) of this title. In any case in which a member or former member who was mentally incompetent on the date such member or former member first became insured under Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance dies within one year of such date, such insurance shall be deemed not to have lapsed for nonpayment of premiums and to have been in force on the date of death. Where insurance is in force under the preceding sentence, any unpaid premiums may be deducted from the proceeds of the insurance. Any person who claims eligibility for Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance based on disability incurred during a period of duty shall be required to submit evidence of qualifying health conditions and, if required, to submit to physical examinations at their own expense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Any amount of Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance in force on any person on the date of such person's death shall be paid, upon the establishment of a valid claim therefor, pursuant to the provisions of section 1970 of this title. However, any designation of beneficiary or beneficiaries for Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance filed with a uniformed service until changed, shall be considered a designation of beneficiary or beneficiaries for Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance, but not for more than sixty days after the effective date of the insured's Veterans&rsquo; Group Insurance, unless at the end of such sixty-day period, the insured is incompetent in which event such designation may continue in force until the disability is removed but not for more than five years after the effective date of the insured's Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance. Except as indicated above in incompetent cases, after such sixty-day period, any designation of beneficiary or beneficiaries for Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance to be effective must be by a writing signed by the <!-- PDFPage:276 -->insured and received by the administrative office established under section 1966(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) An insured under Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance shall have the right at any time to convert such insurance to an individual policy of life insurance upon written application for conversion made to the participating company the insured selects and payment of the required premiums. The individual policy will be issued without medical examination on a plan then currently written by such company which does not provide for the payment of any sum less than the face value thereof or for the payment of an additional amount as premiums in the event the insured performs active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training. The Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance policy converted to an individual policy under this subsection shall terminate on the day before the date on which the individual policy becomes effective. Upon request to the administrative office established under section 1966(b) of this title, an insured under Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance shall be furnished a list of life insurance companies participating in the program established under this subchapter. In addition to the life insurance companies participating in the program established under this subchapter, the list furnished to an insured under this section shall include additional life insurance companies (not so participating) which meet qualifying criteria, terms, and conditions established by the Secretary and agree to sell insurance to former members in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The provisions of subsections (d) and (e) of section 1971 of this title shall be applicable to Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance. However, a separate accounting shall be required for each program of insurance authorized under this subchapter. In such accounting, the Secretary is authorized to allocate claims and other costs among such programs of insurance according to accepted actuarial principles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Any person whose Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance was continued in force after termination of duty or discharge from service under the law as in effect prior to the date on which the Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance program (provided for under section 1977 of this title) became effective, and whose coverage under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance terminated less than four years prior to such date, shall be eligible within one year from the effective date of the Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance program to apply for and be granted Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance in an amount equal to the amount of the insured's Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance which was not converted to an individual policy under prior law. Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance issued under this subsection shall be issued for a term period equal to five years, less the time elapsing between the termination of the applicant's Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance and the effective date on which the Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance program became effective. Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance under this subsection shall only be issued upon application to the administrative office established under section 1966(b) of this title, payment of the required premium, and proof of good health satisfactory to that office, which proof shall be submitted at the applicant's own expense. Any person who cannot meet the good health requirements for insurance under this subsection solely because of a service-connected disability shall have such disability waived.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1984. Suits on insurance</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In the event of disagreement as to claim, including claim for refund of premiums, under contract of National Service Life Insurance, United States Government life insurance, or yearly renewable term insurance between the Secretary and any person or persons claiming thereunder an action on the claim may be brought against the United States either in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the district court of the United States in and for the district in which such per<!-- PDFPage:280 -->son or any one of them resides, and jurisdiction is conferred upon such courts to hear and determine all such controversies. All persons having or claiming to have an interest in such insurance may be made parties to such suit, and such as are not inhabitants of or found within the district in which suit is brought may be brought in by order of the court to be served personally or by publication or in such other reasonable manner as the court may direct. In all cases where the Secretary acknowledges the indebtedness of the United States upon any such contract of insurance and there is a dispute as to the person or persons entitled to payment, a suit in the nature of a bill of interpleader may be brought at the request of the Secretary in the name of the United States against all persons having or claiming to have any interest in such insurance in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the district court in and for the district in which any such claimant resides; however, no less than thirty days before instituting such suit the Secretary shall mail a notice of such intention to each of the persons to be made parties to the suit. The courts of appeals for the several circuits, including the District of Columbia, shall respectively exercise appellate jurisdiction and, except as provided in section 1254 of title 28, the decrees of such courts of appeals shall be final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) No suit on yearly renewable term insurance, United States Government life insurance, or National Service Life Insurance shall be allowed under this section unless the same shall have been brought within six years after the right accrued for which the claim is made. For the purposes of this section it shall be deemed that the right accrued on the happening of the contingency on which the claim is founded. The limitation of six years is suspended for the period elapsing between the filing with the Secretary of the claim sued upon and the denial of the claim. However, if a claim is timely filed the claimant shall have not less than ninety days from the date of mailing of notice of denial within which to file suit. After June 28, 1936, notice of denial of the claim under a contract of insurance shall be by registered mail or by certified mail directed to the claimant's last address of record. Infants, insane persons, or persons under other legal disability, or persons rated as incompetent or insane by the Secretary shall have three years in which to bring suit after the removal of their disabilities. If suit is seasonably begun and fails for defect in process, or for other reasons not affecting the merits, a new action, if one lies, may be brought within a year though the period of limitation has elapsed. No State or other statute of limitations shall be applicable to suits filed under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In any suit, action, or proceeding brought under the provisions of this section subpenas for witnesses who are required to attend a court of the United States in any district may run into any other district. However, no writ of subpena shall issue for witnesses living out of the district in which the court is held at a greater distance than one hundred miles from the place of holding the same without the permission of the court being first had upon proper application and cause shown. The word &ldquo;district&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;district court&rdquo; as used in this section shall be construed to include the District of Columbia and the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Attorneys of the Department, when assigned to assist in the trial of cases, and employees of the Department when ordered in writing by the Secretary to appear as witnesses, shall be paid the regular travel and subsistence allowance paid to other employees when on official travel status.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Part-time and fee-basis employees of the Department, in addition to their regular travel and subsistence allowance, when ordered in writing by the Secretary to appear as witnesses in suits under this section, may be allowed, within the discretion and under written orders of the Secretary, a fee in an amount not to exceed $50 per day.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Employees of the Department who are subpenaed to attend the trial of any suit, under the provisions of this section, as witnesses for a party to such suit shall be granted court leave or authorized absence, as applicable, for the period they are required to be away from the Department in answer to such subpenas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Whenever a judgment or decree shall be rendered in an action brought under the provisions of this section, the court, as a part of its judgment or decree, shall determine and allow reasonable fees for the attorneys of the successful party or parties and apportion same if proper, said fees not to exceed 10 per centum of the amount recovered and to be paid by the Department out of the payments to be made under the judgment or decree at a rate not exceeding one-tenth of each of such payments until paid; except that, in a suit brought by or on behalf of an insured during the insured's lifetime for waiver of premiums on account of total disability, the court, as part of its judgment or decree, shall determine and allow a reasonable fee to be paid by the insured to the insured's attorney.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The term &ldquo;claim&rdquo; as used in this section means any writing which uses words showing an intention to claim insurance benefits; and the term &ldquo;disagreement&rdquo; means a denial of the claim, after consideration on its merits, by the Secretary or any employee or organizational unit of the Department heretofore or hereafter designated therefor by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) The Attorney General of the United States is authorized to agree to a judgment to be rendered by the chief judge of the United States court having jurisdiction of the case, pursuant to compromise approved by the Attorney General upon the recommendation of the United States attorney charged with the defense, upon such terms and for sums within the amount claimed to be payable, in any suit brought under the provisions of this section, on a contract of yearly renewable term insurance, and the Secretary shall make payments in accordance with any such judgment. The Comptroller General of the United States shall allow credit in the accounts of disbursing officers for all payments of insurance made in accordance with any such judgment. All such judgments shall constitute final settlement of the claim and no appeal therefrom shall be authorized.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The United States shall automatically insure any eligible veteran who is or has been granted assistance in securing a suitable housing unit under this chapter against the death of the veteran unless the veteran (1) submits to the Secretary in writing the veterans&rsquo; election not to be insured under this section, or (2) fails to respond in a timely manner to a request from the Secretary for information on which the premium for such insurance can be based.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The amount of insurance provided a veteran under this section may not exceed the lesser of $90,000 or the amount of the loan outstanding on the housing unit. The amount of such insurance shall be reduced according to the amortization schedule of the loan and may not at any time exceed the amount of the outstanding loan with interest. If there is no outstanding loan on the housing unit, insurance is not payable under this section. If an eligible veteran elects not to be insured under this section, the veteran may thereafter be insured under this section, but only upon submission of an application, payment of required premiums, and compliance with such health requirements and other terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:286 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) The premiums charged a veteran for insurance under this section shall be paid at such time and in such manner as the Secretary prescribes. The rates for such premiums shall be based on such mortality data as the Secretary considers appropriate to cover only the mortality cost of insuring standard lives. In the case of a veteran receiving compensation or other cash benefits paid to the veteran by the Secretary, the Secretary shall deduct from such compensation or other benefits the premiums charged the veteran under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The United States shall bear the costs of insurance under this section to the extent that such costs exceed premiums established by the Secretary. Premiums collected on insurance under this section shall be credited to the &ldquo;Veterans Insurance and Indemnities&rdquo; appropriation account, and all disbursements of insurance proceeds under this section shall be made from that account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for such account such amounts as may be necessary to carry out this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Any amount of insurance in force under this section on the date of the death of an eligible veteran insured under this section shall be paid to the holder of the mortgage loan, for payment of which the insurance was granted, for credit on the loan indebtedness. Any liability of the United States under such insurance shall be satisfied when such payment is made. If the Secretary is the holder of the mortgage loan, the insurance proceeds shall be credited to the loan indebtedness and deposited in the Veterans Housing Benefit Program Fund established by section 3722 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary may prescribe such regulations relating to eligibility for insurance under this section, the maximum amount of insurance, the effective date of insurance, the maximum duration of insurance, and other pertinent matters not specifically provided for in this section as the Secretary determines are in the best interest of veterans or the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The amount of the insurance in force at any time shall be the amount necessary to pay the mortgage indebtedness in full, except as otherwise limited by subsection (b) of this section or regulations prescribed by the Secretary under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The Secretary shall issue to each veteran insured under this section a certificate setting forth the benefits to which the veteran is entitled under the insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Insurance under this section shall terminate upon whichever of the following events first occurs:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Satisfaction of the veteran's indebtedness under the loan upon which the insurance is based.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The veteran's seventieth birthday.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Termination of the veteran's ownership of the property securing the loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Discontinuance of payment of premiums by the veteran.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Termination of life insurance under this section shall not affect the guaranty or insurance of the loan by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Applications for payments under section 2302 of this title must be filed within two years after the burial of the veteran. If the burial allowance was not payable at the death of the veteran because of the nature of the veteran's discharge from the service, but after the veteran's death the veteran's discharge has been corrected by competent authority so as to reflect a discharge from the service under conditions other than dishonorable, then the burial allowance may be paid if a claim is filed within two years from the date of correction of the discharge. If a claimant's application is incomplete at the time it is originally submitted, the Secretary shall notify the applicant of the evidence necessary to complete the application. If such evidence is not received within one year from the date of such notification, no allowance may be paid.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary shall furnish, when requested, an appropriate memorial headstone or <!-- PDFPage:292 -->marker for the purpose of commemorating an eligible individual whose remains are unavailable.

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall provide an outer burial receptacle for each new grave in an open cemetery under the control of the National Cemetery Administration in which remains are interred in a casket.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to pay the amount by which the cost of the outer burial receptacle exceeds the cost of the grave liner that would otherwise have been provided in the absence of the election; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to pay the amount of the administrative costs incurred by the Secretary (or, with respect to Arlington National Cemetery, the Secretary of the Army) in providing the outer burial receptacle in lieu of such grave liner.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Regulations or procedures under paragraph (2) may provide for the use of a voucher system, or other system of reimbursement approved by the Secretary (or, with respect to Arlington National Cemetery, the Secretary of the Army), for payment for outer burial receptacles other than grave liners provided under such regulations or procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) When the Secretary has furnished a headstone or marker under subsection (a) for the unmarked grave of an individual, the Secretary shall, if feasible, add a memorial inscription to that headstone or marker rather than furnishing a separate headstone or marker under that subsection for the surviving spouse of such individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Secretary has furnished a memorial headstone or marker under subsection (b) for purposes of commemorating a veteran or an individual who died in the active military, naval, or air service, the Secretary shall, if feasible, add a memorial inscription to that headstone or marker rather than furnishing a separate memorial headstone or marker under that subsection for the surviving spouse of such individual.</p>
