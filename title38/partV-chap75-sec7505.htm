<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Amount of Repayment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall establish, by regulations, procedures for determining the amount of the repayment required under this section and the circumstances under which an exception to the required repayment may be granted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Waiver or Suspension of Compliance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall prescribe regulations providing for the waiver or suspension of any obligation of an individual for service or payment under this chapter (or an agreement under this chapter) whenever&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) noncompliance by the individual is due to circumstances beyond the control of the individual; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary determines that the waiver or suspension of compliance is in the best interest of the United States.</p>
