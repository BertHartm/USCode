<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) In consideration of reciprocal services extended to the United States, the Secretary, upon request of the proper officials of the government of any nation allied or associated with the United States in World War I (except any nation which was an enemy of the United States during World War II), or in World War II, may furnish to discharged members of the armed forces of such government, under agreements requiring reimbursement in cash of expenses so incurred, at such rates and under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, medical, surgical, and dental treatment, hospital care, transportation and traveling expenses, prosthetic appliances, education, training, or similar benefits authorized by the laws of such nation for its veterans, and services required in extending such benefits. Hospitalization in a Department facility shall not be afforded under this section, except in emergencies, unless there are available beds surplus to the needs of veterans of this country. The Secretary may also pay the court costs and other expenses incident to the proceedings taken for the commitment of such discharged members who are mentally incompetent to institutions for the care or treatment of the insane.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary, in carrying out the provisions of this subsection, may contract for necessary services in private, State, and other Government hospitals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) All amounts received by the Department as reimbursement for such services shall be credited to the current appropriation of the Department from which expenditures were made under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Persons who served in the active service in the armed forces of any government allied with the United States in World War II and who at time of entrance into such active service were citizens of the United States shall, by virtue of such service, and if otherwise qualified, be entitled to the benefits of chapters 31 and 37 of this title in the same manner and to the same extent as veterans of World War II are entitled. No such benefit shall be extended to any person who is not a resident of the United States at the time of filing claim, or to any person who has applied for and received the same or any similar benefit from the government in whose armed forces such person served.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Any person who served during World War I or World War II as a member of any armed force of the Government of Czechoslovakia or Poland and participated while so serving in armed conflict with an enemy of the United States and has been a citizen of the United States for at least ten years shall, by virtue of such service, and upon satisfactory evidence thereof, be entitled to hospital and domiciliary care and medical services within the United States under chapter 17 of this title to the same extent as if such service had been performed in the Armed Forces of the United States unless such person is entitled to, or would, upon application thereof, be entitled to, payment for equivalent care and services under a program established by the foreign government concerned for persons who served in its armed forces in World War I or World War II.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In order to assist the Secretary in making a determination of proper service eligibility under this subsection, each applicant for the benefits thereof shall furnish an authenticated certification from the French Ministry of Defense or the British War Office as to records in either such Office which clearly indicate military service of the applicant in the Czechoslovakian or Polish armed forces and subsequent service in or with the armed forces of France or Great Britain during the period of World War I or World War II.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under regulations prescribed by the President pursuant to the provisions of this section, the Secretary may pay the actual necessary expense of travel (including lodging and subsistence), or in lieu thereof an allowance based upon mileage traveled, of any person to or from a Department facility or other place in connection with vocational rehabilitation, counseling required by the Secretary pursuant to chapter 34 or 35 of this title, or for the purpose of examination, treatment, or care. In addition to the mileage allowance authorized by this section, there may be allowed reimbursement for the actual cost of ferry fares, and bridge, road, and tunnel tolls.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section and notwithstanding subsection (g)(2)(A) of this section or any other provision of law, if, with respect to any fiscal year, the Secretary exercises the authority under this section to make any payments, the Secretary shall make the payments provided for in this section to or for the following persons for travel during such fiscal year for examination, treatment, or care for which the person is eligible:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A veteran or other person whose travel is in connection with treatment or care for a service-connected disability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A veteran with a service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A veteran receiving pension under section 1521 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) A veteran (i) whose annual income (as determined under section 1503 of this title) does not exceed the maximum annual rate of pension which would be payable to such veteran if such veteran were eligible for pension under section 1521 of this title, or (ii) who is determined, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to be unable to defray the expenses of the travel for which payment under this section is claimed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, a veteran or other person whose travel to or from a Department facility is medically required to be performed by a special mode of travel and who is determined under such regulations to be unable to defray the expenses of the travel for which payment under this section is claimed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) A veteran whose travel to a Department facility is incident to a scheduled compensation and pension examination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may make payments provided for in this section to or for any person not covered by paragraph (1) of this subsection for travel by such person for examination, treatment, or care. Such payments shall be made in accordance with regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall not make payments under this section for travel performed by a special mode of travel unless (i) the travel by such mode is medically required and is authorized by the Secretary before the travel begins, or (ii) the travel by such mode is in connection with a medical emergency of such a nature that the delay incident to obtaining authorization from the Secretary to use that mode of travel would have been hazardous to the person's life or health.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of travel by a person to or from a Department facility by special mode of travel, the Secretary may provide payment under this section to the provider of the transportation by special mode before determining the eligibility of such person for such payment if the Secretary determines that providing such payment is in the best interest of furnishing care and services. Such a payment shall be made subject to subsequently recovering from such person the amount <!-- PDFPage:31 -->of the payment if such person is determined to have been ineligible for payment for such travel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Secretary, in making a payment under this section to or for a person described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of subsection (b)(1) of this section for travel for examination, treatment, or care, shall deduct from the amount otherwise payable an amount equal to $3 for each one-way trip.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a person who is determined by the Secretary to be a person who is required to make six or more one-way trips for needed examination, treatment, or care during the remainder of the calendar month in which the determination is made or during any subsequent calendar month during the one-year period following the last day of the month in which the determination is made, the amount deducted by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection from payments for trips made to or from such facility during any such month shall not, except as provided in paragraph (5) of this subsection, exceed $18.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No deduction shall be made pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection in the case of a person whose travel to or from a Department facility is performed by a special mode of travel for which payment under this section is authorized under subsection (b)(3) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may waive the deduction requirement of paragraph (1) of this subsection in the case of the travel of any veteran for whom the imposition of the deduction would cause severe financial hardship. The Secretary shall prescribe in regulations the conditions under which a finding of severe financial hardship is warranted for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Whenever the Secretary increases or decreases the rates of allowances or reimbursement to be paid under this section, the Secretary shall, effective on the date on which such increase or decrease takes effect, adjust proportionately the dollar amounts specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection as such amounts may have been increased or decreased pursuant to this paragraph before such date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Payment of the following expenses or allowances in connection with vocational rehabilitation, counseling, or upon termination of examination, treatment, or care, may be made before the completion of travel:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The mileage allowance authorized by subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Actual local travel expenses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The expense of hiring an automobile or ambulance, or the fee authorized for the services of a nonemployee attendant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) When any person entitled to mileage under this section requires an attendant (other than an employee of the Department) in order to perform such travel, the attendant may be allowed expenses of travel upon the same basis as such person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary may provide for the purchase of printed reduced-fare requests for use by veterans and their authorized attendants when traveling at their own expense to or from any Department facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) In carrying out the purposes of this section, the Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of General Services, the Secretary of Transportation, the Comptroller General of the United States, and representatives of organizations of veterans, shall conduct periodic investigations of the actual cost of travel (including lodging and subsistence) to beneficiaries while traveling to or from a Department facility or other place pursuant to the provisions of this section, and the estimated cost of alternative modes of travel, including public transportation and the operation of privately owned vehicles. The Secretary shall conduct such investigations immediately following any alteration in the rates described in paragraph (3)(C) of this subsection, and, in any event, immediately following the enactment of this subsection and not less often than annually thereafter, and based thereon, shall determine rates of allowances or reimbursement to be paid under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In no event shall payment be provided under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) unless the person claiming reimbursement has been determined, pursuant to regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, to be unable to defray the expenses of such travel (except with respect to a person receiving benefits for or in connection with a service-connected disability under this title, a veteran receiving or eligible to receive pension under section 1521 of this title, or a person whose annual income, determined in accordance with section 1503 of this title, does not exceed the maximum annual rate of pension which would be payable to such person if such person were eligible for pension under section 1521 of this title);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to reimburse for the cost of travel by privately owned vehicle in any amount in excess of the cost of such travel by public transportation unless (i) public transportation is not reasonably accessible or would be medically inadvisable, or (ii) the cost of such travel is not greater than the cost of public transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in excess of the actual expense incurred by such person as certified in writing by such person.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In conducting investigations and determining rates under this section, the Secretary shall review and analyze, among other factors, the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) Depreciation of original vehicle costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) gasoline and oil costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) maintenance, accessories, parts, and tire costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) insurance costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) State and Federal taxes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The availability of and time required for public transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The per diem rates, mileage allowances, and expenses of travel authorized under sections 5702 and 5704 of title 5 for employees of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Before determining rates or adjusting amounts under this section and not later than sixty days after any alteration in the rates described in paragraph (3)(C) of this subsection, the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Senate a report containing the <!-- PDFPage:32 -->rates and amounts the Secretary proposes to establish or continue with a full justification therefor in terms of each of the limitations and factors set forth in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The Secretary, in consultation and coordination with the Secretary of Transportation and appropriate representatives of veterans&rsquo; service organizations, shall take all appropriate steps to facilitate the establishment and maintenance of a program under which such organizations, or individuals who are volunteering their services to the Department, would take responsibility for the transportation, without reimbursement from the Department, to Department facilities of veterans (primarily those residing in areas which are geographically accessible to such facilities) who seek services or benefits from the Department under chapter 17 or other provisions of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;114. Multiyear procurement</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary may enter into a multiyear contract for the procurement of supplies or services if the Secretary makes each of the following determinations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Appropriations are available for obligations that are necessary for total payments that would be required during the fiscal year in which the contract is entered into, plus the estimated amount of any cancellation charge payable under the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The contract is in the best interest of the United States by reason of the effect that use of a multiyear, rather than one-year, contract would have in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) reducing costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) achieving economies in contract administration or in any other Department activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) increasing quality of performance by or service from the contractors; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) encouraging effective competition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) During the proposed contract period&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) there will be a continuing or recurring need for the supplies or services being procured;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there is not a substantial likelihood of substantial changes in the need for such supplies or services in terms of the total quantity of such supplies or services or of the rate of delivery of such supplies or services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the specifications for the supplies or services are expected to be reasonably stable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The risks relating to the prospective contractor's ability to perform in accordance with the specifications and other terms of the contract are not excessive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The use of a multiyear contract will not inhibit small business concerns in competing for the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) In the case of the procurement of a pharmaceutical item for which a patent has expired less than four years before the date on which the solicitation of offers is issued, there is no substantial likelihood that increased competition among potential contractors <!-- PDFPage:36 -->would occur during the term of the contract as the result of the availability of generic equivalents increasing during the term of the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) A multiyear contract authorized by this section shall contain&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a provision that the obligation of the United States under the contract during any fiscal year which is included in the contract period and is subsequent to the fiscal year during which the contract is entered into is contingent on the availability of sufficient appropriations (as determined by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection) if, at the time the contract is entered into, appropriations are not available to cover the total estimated payments that will be required during the full term of the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) notwithstanding section 1502(a) of title 31, a provision for the payment of reasonable cancellation charges to compensate the contractor for nonrecurring, unrecovered costs, if any, if the performance is cancelled pursuant to the provision required by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If, during a fiscal year after the fiscal year during which a multiyear contract is entered into under this section, the Secretary determines that, in light of other funding needs involved in the operation of Department programs, the amount of funds appropriated for such subsequent fiscal year is not sufficient for such contract, the Secretary shall cancel such contract pursuant to the provisions required by paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Cancellation charges under a multiyear contract shall be paid from the appropriated funds which were originally available for performance of the contract or the payment of cancellation costs unless such funds are not available in an amount sufficient to pay the entire amount of the cancellation charges payable under the contract. In a case in which such funds are not available in such amount, funds available for the procurement of supplies and services for use for the same purposes as the supplies or services procured through such contract shall be used to the extent necessary to pay such cost.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to restrict the Secretary's exercise of the right to terminate for convenience a contract under any other provision of law which authorizes multiyear contracting.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations for the implementation of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) For the purposes of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;appropriations&rdquo; has the meaning given that term in section 1511 of title 31.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;multiyear contract&rdquo; means a contract which by its terms is to remain in effect for a period which extends beyond the end of the fiscal year during which the contract is entered into but not beyond the end of the fourth fiscal year following such fiscal year. Such term does not include a contract for construction or for a lease of real property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;nonrecurring, unrecovered costs&rdquo; means those costs reasonably incurred by the contractor in performing a multiyear contract which (as determined under regulations prescribed under subsection (d) of this section) are generally incurred on a one-time basis.</p>
