<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) As long as unemployment and underemployment continue as serious problems among disabled veterans and Vietnam-era veterans, alleviating unemployment and underemployment among such veterans is a national responsibility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Because of the special nature of employment and training needs of such veterans and the national responsibility to meet those <!-- PDFPage:644 -->needs, policies and programs to increase opportunities for such veterans to obtain employment, job training, counseling, and job placement services and assistance in securing advancement in employment should be effectively and vigorously implemented by the Secretary of Labor and such implementation should be accomplished through the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans&rsquo; Employment and Training.</p>
