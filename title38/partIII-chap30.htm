<p class="statutory-body">(2) No educational assistance allowance may be paid under this chapter to an individual for any month during which such individual is pursuing a program of education consisting exclusively of flight training until the Secretary has received from that individual and the institution providing such training a certification of the flight training received by the individual during that month and the tuition and other fees charged for that training.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The number of months of entitlement charged in the case of any individual for a program of education described in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be equal to the number (including any fraction) determined by dividing the <!-- PDFPage:307 -->total amount of educational assistance paid such individual for such program by the monthly rate of educational assistance which, except for paragraph (1) of this subsection, such individual would otherwise be paid under subsection (a)(1), (b)(1), (d), or (e)(1) of section 3015 of this title, as the case may be.</p>
