<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the veteran's certificate of discharge or release from active duty does not bear a certification that the veteran was provided, within the 90-day period immediately before the date of such discharge or release, a complete dental examination (including dental X-rays) and all appropriate dental services and treatment indicated by the examination to be needed;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, in any year in which the President's Budget for the fiscal year beginning October 1 of such year includes an amount for expenditures for contract dental care under the provisions of this subsection and section 1703 of this title during such fiscal year in excess of the level of expenditures made for such purpose during fiscal year 1978, the Secretary shall, not later than February 15 of such year, submit a report to the appropriate committees of the Congress justifying the requested level of expenditures for contract dental care and explaining why the application of the criteria prescribed in section 1703 of this title for contracting with private facilities and in the second sentence of section 1710(c) of this title for furnishing incidental dental care to hospitalized veterans will not preclude the need for expenditures for contract dental care in excess of the fiscal year 1978 level of expenditures for such purpose. In any case in which the amount included in the President's Budget for any fiscal year for expenditures for contract dental care under such provisions is not in excess of the level of expenditures made for such purpose during fiscal year 1978 and the Secretary determines after the date of submission of such budget and before the end of such fiscal year that the level of expenditures for such contract dental care during such fiscal year will exceed the fiscal year 1978 level of expenditures, the Secretary shall submit a report to the appropriate committees of the Congress containing both a justification (with respect to the projected level of expenditures for such fiscal year) and an explanation as required in the preceding sentence in the case of a report submitted pursuant to such sentence. Any report submitted pursuant to this paragraph shall include a comment by the Secretary on the effect of the application of the criteria prescribed in the second sentence of section 1710(c) of this title for furnishing incidental dental care to hospitalized veterans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A report under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph with respect to a fiscal year is not required if, in the documents submitted by the Secretary to the Congress in justification for the amounts included for Department programs in the President's Budget, the Secretary specifies with respect to contract dental care described in such subparagraph&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Dental services and related appliances for a dental condition or disability described in para<!-- PDFPage:204 -->graph (1)(B) of subsection (a) shall be furnished on a one-time completion basis, unless the services rendered on a one-time completion basis are found unacceptable within the limitations of good professional standards, in which event such additional services may be afforded as are required to complete professionally acceptable treatment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Dental appliances, wheelchairs, artificial limbs, trusses, special clothing, and similar appliances to be furnished by the Secretary under this section may be procured by the Secretary either by purchase or by manufacture, whichever the Secretary determines may be advantageous and reasonably necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary shall furnish to each veteran who is receiving additional compensation or allowance under chapter 11 of this title, or increased pension as a veteran of a period of war, by reason of being permanently housebound or in need of regular aid and attendance, such drugs and medicines as may be ordered on prescription of a duly licensed physician as specific therapy in the treatment of any illness or injury suffered by such veteran. The Secretary shall continue to furnish such drugs and medicines so ordered to any such veteran in need of regular aid and attendance whose pension payments have been discontinued solely because such veteran's annual income is greater than the applicable maximum annual income limitation, but only so long as such veteran's annual income does not exceed such maximum annual income limitation by more than $1,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) In order to assist the Secretary of Health and Human Services in carrying out national immunization programs under other provisions of law, the Secretary may authorize the administration of immunizations to eligible veterans who voluntarily request such immunizations in connection with the provision of care for a disability under this chapter in any Department health care facility. Any such immunization shall be made using vaccine furnished by the Secretary of Health and Human Services at no cost to the Department. For such purpose, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may provide such vaccine to the Department at no cost. Section 7316 of this title shall apply to claims alleging negligence or malpractice on the part of Department personnel granted immunity under such section.</p>

Such counseling may include a general mental and psychological assessment of the veteran to ascertain whether such veteran has mental or psychological problems associated with readjustment to civilian life.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) applies to the following veterans:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Any veteran who served on active duty&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) in a theater of combat operations (as determined by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Defense) during the Vietnam era; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Any veteran (other than a veteran covered by clause (i)) who served on active duty during the Vietnam era who seeks or is furnished such counseling before January 1, 2004.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;hostilities&rdquo; means an armed conflict in which the members of the Armed Forces are subjected to danger comparable to the danger to which members of the Armed Forces have been subjected in combat with enemy armed forces during a period of war, as determined by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) If, on the basis of the assessment furnished under subsection (a) of this section, a physician or psychologist employed by the Department (or, in areas where no such physician or psychologist is available, a physician or psychologist carrying out such function under a contract or fee arrangement with the Secretary) determines that the provision of mental health services to such veteran is necessary to facilitate the successful readjustment of the veteran to civilian life, such veteran shall, within the limits of Department facilities, be furnished such services on an outpatient basis. For the purposes of furnishing such mental health services, the counseling furnished under subsection (a) of this section shall be considered to have been furnished by the Department as a part of hospital care. Any hospital care and other medical services considered necessary on the basis of the assessment furnished under subsection (a) of this section shall be furnished only in accordance with the eligibility criteria otherwise set forth in this chapter (including the eligibility criteria set forth in section 1784 of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Mental health services furnished under paragraph (1) of this subsection may, if determined to be essential to the effective treatment and readjustment of the veteran, include such consultation, counseling, training, services, and expenses as are described in sections 1782 and 1783 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">[(c) Repealed. Pub. L. 104&ndash;262, title III, &sect;331(b), Oct. 9, 1996, 110 Stat. 3198.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Under Secretary for Health may provide for such training of professional, paraprofessional, and lay personnel as is necessary to carry out this section effectively, and, in carrying out this section, may utilize the services of paraprofessionals, individuals who are volunteers working without compensation, and individuals who are veteran-students (as described in section 3485 of this title) in initial intake and screening activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) In furnishing counseling and related mental health services under subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the Secretary shall have available the same authority to enter into contracts with private facilities that is available to the Secretary (under sections 1703(a)(2) and 1710(a)(1)(B) of this title) in furnishing medical services to veterans suffering from total service-connected disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before furnishing counseling or related mental health services described in subsections (a) and (b) of this section through a contract facility, as authorized by this subsection, the Secretary shall approve (in accordance with criteria which the Secretary shall prescribe by regulation) the quality and effectiveness of the program operated by such facility for the purpose for which the counseling or services are to be furnished.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A closure or relocation of a center which is proposed in such national plan may be carried out only after the end of the 120-day period beginning on the date on which the national plan is submitted. A closure or relocation of a center not proposed in such plan may be carried out only after the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date the Secretary submits a revision to such plan in which the closure or relocation of that center is proposed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary may relocate a center in existence on January 1, 1988, without regard to the national plan (including any revision to such plan) if such relocation is to a new location away from a Department general health-care facility when such relocation is necessitated by circumstances beyond the control of the Depart<!-- PDFPage:211 -->ment. Such a relocation may be carried out only after the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the Secretary notifies the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the proposed relocation, of the circumstances making it necessary, and of the reason for the selection of the new site for the center.</p>

Such report shall give particular attention, in light of the results of the study required by section 102 of the Veterans&rsquo; Health Care Amendments of 1983 (Public Law 98&ndash;160), to the provision of such counseling and services to veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and to the diagnosis and treatment of such disorder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The report required by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the opinion of the Secretary with respect to (I) the extent to which the readjustment needs of veterans who served on active duty during the Vietnam era remain unmet, and (II) the extent to which the provision of readjustment counseling services under this section in centers is needed to meet such needs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in light of the opinion submitted pursuant to clause (i) of this subparagraph, such recommendations for amendments to this subsection and for other legislative and administrative action as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary, after considering the recommendations of the Under Secretary for Health, shall submit to such committees a report setting forth a national plan for all centers in existence on January 1, 1988. Such national plan shall set forth the Secretary's proposals as to each such center for a period (to be determined by the Secretary) of not less than 12 months beginning on the date of the submission of the report. The plan shall include, as to each center, whether the Secretary proposes to relocate the center to a general Department facility, relocate the center to a new location away from a general Department facility, expand the center in the same location, or close the center. The plan shall also set forth any proposal of the Secretary to open additional centers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The plan shall include the Secretary's evaluation as to how, in light of each of the criteria described in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, the proposal set forth in the plan for each center covered by the plan would ensure the continued availability and effective furnishing of readjustment counseling services to eligible veterans needing such services in the geographic area served by that center.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall make the evaluation described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph with respect to any center in light of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The distribution of Vietnam-era veterans in the geographic area served by the center and the relationships between the location of such center and the general Department facility and such distribution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The distance between the center and the general Department facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The availability of other entities (such as State, local, or private outreach facilities) which provide assistance to Vietnam-era veterans in the area served by the center.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) The availability of transportation to, and parking at, the center and the general Department facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) The availability, cost, and suitability of the space at the general Department facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) The overall cost impact of the proposed closure or relocation, including a comparison of the recurring nonpersonnel costs of providing readjustment counseling to the same estimated number of veterans at the center and the general Department facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) The workload trends over the two previous fiscal years, and projected over the next fiscal year (or longer), at the center.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(viii) Such other factors as the Secretary determines to be relevant to making the evaluation described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For the purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;general Department facility&rdquo; means a Department facility which is not a center and at which readjustment counseling would be furnished in a particular geographic area upon the closure or relocation of a center.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) After submitting the plan required by paragraph (3) of this subsection, the Secretary may submit to the committees a revision to such plan in order to modify the proposal set forth in the plan as to any center. Any such revision shall include, with respect to each center addressed in the revision, a description of the Secretary's evaluation of the matters specified in paragraphs (3)(B) and (3)(C) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For purposes of determining a period of time under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, if the national plan (or a revision to the national plan) is submitted to the committees during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before and ending 60 days after the final day of a session of the Congress, it shall be deemed to have been submitted on the sixty-first day after the final day of such session.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">[(h) Repealed. Pub. L. 102&ndash;83, &sect;4(b)(6), Aug. 6, 1991, 105 Stat. 405.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) For the purposes of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;center&rdquo; means a facility (including a Resource Center designated under subsection (h)(3)(A) of this section) which is operated by the Department for the provision of services under this section and which (A) is situated apart from Department general health-care facilities, or (B) was so situated but has been relocated to a Department general health-care facility.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1)(A) The Secretary may furnish adult day health care services to a veteran enrolled under section 1705(a) of this title who would otherwise require nursing home care.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may provide in-kind assistance (through the services of Department employees and the sharing of other Department resources) to a facility furnishing care to veterans under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. Any such in-kind assistance shall be provided under a contract or agreement between the Secretary and the facility concerned.

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) For the purposes of section 1710(a)(2)(G) of this title, a veteran shall be considered to be unable to defray the expenses of necessary care if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the veteran is eligible to receive medical assistance under a State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the veteran is in receipt of pension under section 1521 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the veteran's attributable income is not greater than the amount set forth in subsection (b).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) For purposes of subsection (a)(3), the income threshold for the calendar year beginning on January 1, 1990, is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) $17,240 in the case of a veteran with no dependents; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $20,688 in the case of a veteran with one dependent, plus $1,150 for each additional dependent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For a calendar year beginning after December 31, 1990, the amounts in effect for purposes of this subsection shall be the amounts in effect for the preceding calendar year as adjusted under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Effective on January 1 of each year, the amounts in effect under subsection (b) of this section shall be increased by the percentage by which the maximum rates of pension were increased under section 5312(a) of this title during the preceding calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Notwithstanding the attributable income of a veteran, the Secretary may refuse to make a determination described in paragraph (2) of this subsection if the corpus of the estate of the veteran is such that under all the circumstances it is reasonable that some part of the corpus of the estate of the veteran be consumed for the veteran's maintenance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A determination described in this paragraph is a determination that for purposes of subsection (a)(3) of this section a veteran's attributable income is not greater than the amount determined under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the corpus of the estate of a veteran shall be determined in the same manner as the manner in which determinations are made of the corpus of the estates of persons under section 1522 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) In order to avoid a hardship to a veteran described in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Secretary may deem the veteran to have an attributable income during the previous year not greater than the amount determined under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A veteran is described in this paragraph for the purposes of subsection (a) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the veteran has an attributable income greater than the amount determined under subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the current projections of such veteran's income for the current year are that the veteran's income for such year will be substantially below the amount determined under subsection (b).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) For purposes of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;attributable income&rdquo; means the income of a veteran for the previous year determined in the same manner as the manner in which a determination is made of the total amount of income by which the rate of pension for such veteran under section 1521 of this title would be reduced if such veteran were eligible for pension under that section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;corpus of the estate of the veteran&rdquo; includes the corpus of the estates of the veteran's spouse and dependent children, if any.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;previous year&rdquo; means the calendar year preceding the year in which the veteran applies for care or services under section 1710(a) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) For the purposes of section 1724(c) of this title, the fact that a veteran is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) eligible to receive medical assistance under a State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a veteran with a service-connected disability; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in receipt of pension under any law administered by the Secretary,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:233 --><p class="statutory-body-block">shall be accepted as sufficient evidence of such veteran's inability to defray necessary expenses.</p>

Neither the absence of a contract or agreement between the Secretary and the provider nor any provision of a contract, agreement, or assignment to the contrary shall operate to modify, limit, or negate the requirement in the preceding sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Independent Right of Recovery</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the United States shall have the independent right to recover any amount paid under this section when, and to the extent that, a third party subsequently makes a payment for the same emergency treatment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any amount paid by the United States to the veteran (or the veteran's personal representative, successor, dependents, or survivors) or to any other person or organization paying for such treatment shall constitute a lien in favor of the United States against any recovery the payee subsequently receives from a third party for the same treatment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any amount paid by the United States to the provider that furnished the veteran's emergency treatment shall constitute a lien against any subsequent amount the provider receives from a third party for the same emergency treatment for which the United States made payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The veteran (or the veteran's personal representative, successor, dependents, or survivors) shall ensure that the Secretary is promptly notified of any payment received from any third party for emergency treatment furnished to the veteran. The veteran (or the veteran's personal representative, successor, dependents, or survivors) shall immediately forward all documents relating to such payment, cooperate with the Secretary in the investigation of such payment, and assist the Secretary in enforcing the United <!-- PDFPage:237 -->States right to recover any payment made under subsection (c)(3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Waiver</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, may waive recovery of a payment made to a veteran under this section that is otherwise required by subsection (d)(1) when the Secretary determines that such waiver would be in the best interest of the United States, as defined by regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;emergency treatment&rdquo; means medical care or services furnished, in the judgment of the Secretary&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) until such time as the veteran can be transferred safely to a Department facility or other Federal facility.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;health-plan contract&rdquo; includes any of the following:</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1729. Recovery by the United States of the cost of certain care and services</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, in any case in which a veteran is furnished care or services under this chapter for a non-service-connected disability described in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the United States has the right to recover or collect reasonable charges for such care or services (as determined by the Secretary) from a third party to the extent that the veteran (or the provider of the care or services) would be eligible to receive payment for such care or services from such third party if the care or services had not been furnished by a department or agency of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection applies to a non-service-connected disability&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that is incurred incident to the veteran's employment and that is covered under a workers&rsquo; compensation law or plan that provides for payment for the cost of health care and <!-- PDFPage:239 -->services provided to the veteran by reason of the disability;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that is incurred as the result of a motor vehicle accident to which applies a State law that requires the owners or operators of motor vehicles registered in that State to have in force automobile accident reparations insurance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that is incurred as the result of a crime of personal violence that occurred in a State, or a political subdivision of a State, in which a person injured as the result of such a crime is entitled to receive health care and services at such State's or subdivision's expense for personal injuries suffered as the result of such crime;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) that is incurred by a veteran&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) who does not have a service-connected disability; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) who is entitled to care (or payment of the expenses of care) under a health-plan contract; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) for which care and services are furnished before October 1, 2007, under this chapter to a veteran who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) has a service-connected disability; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) is entitled to care (or payment of the expenses of care) under a health-plan contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of a health-plan contract that contains a requirement for payment of a deductible or copayment by the veteran&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the veteran's not having paid such deductible or copayment with respect to care or services furnished under this chapter shall not preclude recovery or collection under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount that the United States may collect or recover under this section shall be reduced by the appropriate deductible or copayment amount, or both.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) As to the right provided in subsection (a) of this section, the United States shall be subrogated to any right or claim that the veteran (or the veteran's personal representative, successor, dependents, or survivors) may have against a third party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In order to enforce any right or claim to which the United States is subrogated under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the United States may intervene or join in any action or proceeding brought by the veteran (or the veteran's personal representative, successor, dependents, or survivors) against a third party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The United States may institute and prosecute legal proceedings against the third party if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) an action or proceeding described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph is not begun within 180 days after the first day on which care or services for which recovery is sought are furnished to the veteran by the Secretary under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the United States has sent written notice by certified mail to the veteran at the veteran's last-known address (or to the veteran's personal representative or successor) of the intention of the United States to institute such legal proceedings; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) a period of 60 days has passed following the mailing of such notice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A proceeding under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph may not be brought after the end of the six-year period beginning on the last day on which the care or services for which recovery is sought are furnished.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Secretary may compromise, settle, or waive any claim which the United States has under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary, after consultation with the Comptroller General of the United States, shall prescribe regulations for the purpose of determining reasonable charges for care or services under subsection (a)(1) of this section.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) at the time of initiating the assistance the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is furnishing the veteran medical services on an outpatient basis or hospital, domiciliary, or nursing home care; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
