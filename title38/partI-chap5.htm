<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) applies to an administrative reorganization of any unit of the Central Office that is the duty station for 30 or more employees if the reorganization involves a reduction in any fiscal year in the number of full-time equivalent employees with permanent duty station in such unit by 50 percent or more.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;administrative reorganization&rdquo; does not include a consolidation or redistribution of functions at a covered field office or facility, or between components of the Veterans Benefits Administration and the Veterans Health Administration at a Department medical and regional office center, if after the consolidation or redistribution the same number of full-time equivalent employees continues to perform the affected functions at that field office, facility, or center.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) For purposes of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;covered field office or facility&rdquo; means a Department office or facility outside the Central Office that is the permanent duty station for 25 or more employees or that is a free-standing outpatient clinic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;detailed plan and justification&rdquo; means, with respect to an administrative reorganization, a written report that, at a minimum, includes the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Specification of the number of employees by which each covered office or facility affected is to be reduced, the responsibilities of those employees, and the means by which the reduction is to be accomplished.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Identification of any existing or planned office or facility at which the number of employees is to be increased and specification of the number and responsibilities of the additional employees at each such office or facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) A description of the changes in the functions carried out at any existing office or facility and the functions to be assigned to an office or facility not in existence on the date that the plan and justification are submitted pursuant to subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) An explanation of the reasons for the determination that the reorganization is appropriate and advisable in terms of the statutory missions and long-term goals of the Department.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) A description of the effects that the reorganization may have on the provision of benefits and services to veterans and dependents of veterans (including the provision of benefits and services through offices and facilities of the Department not directly affected by the reorganization).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Estimates of the costs of the reorganization and of the cost impact of the reorganization, together with analyses supporting those estimates.</p>
