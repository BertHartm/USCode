<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) hold unlawful and set aside decisions, findings (other than those described in clause (4) of this subsection), conclusions, rules, and regulations issued or adopted by the Secretary, the Board of Veterans&rsquo; Appeals, or the Chairman of the Board found to be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in the case of a finding of material fact adverse to the claimant made in reaching a decision in a case before the Department with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary, hold unlawful and set aside or reverse such finding if the finding is clearly erroneous.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
