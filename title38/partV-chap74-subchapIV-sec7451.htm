<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7451. Nurses and other health-care personnel: competitive pay</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) It is the purpose of this section to ensure, by a means providing increased responsibility and authority to directors of Department health-care facilities, that the rates of basic pay for health-care personnel positions described in paragraph (2) in each Department health-care facility (including the rates of basic pay of personnel employed in such positions on a part-time basis) are sufficient for that facility to be competitive, on the basis of pay and other employee benefits, with non-Department health-care facilities in the same labor-market area in the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel for those positions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The health-care personnel positions referred to in paragraph (1) (hereinafter in this section referred to as &ldquo;covered positions&rdquo;) are the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Registered nurse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Such positions referred to in paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 7401 of this title (other than the positions of physician, dentist, and registered nurse) as the Secretary may determine upon the recommendation of the Under Secretary for Health.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the rates of basic pay for covered positions in the Department shall be established and adjusted in accordance with this section instead of subsection (b)(1) of section 7404 of this title or chapter 53 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Under such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe, the Secretary shall establish and adjust the rates of basic pay for covered positions at the following health-care facilities in order to provide rates of basic pay that enable the Secretary to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of health-care personnel in such positions at those facilities:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The Veterans Memorial Medical Center in the Republic of the Philippines.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Department of Veterans Affairs health-care facilities located outside the contiguous States, Alaska, and Hawaii.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary, after receiving the recommendation of the Under Secretary for Health, shall prescribe regulations setting forth criteria and procedures to carry out this section and section 7452 of this title. Requirements in such regulations for directors to provide and maintain documentation of actions taken under this section shall require no more documentation than the minimum essential for responsible administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary shall maintain the five grade levels for nurses employed by the Department under section 7401(1) of this title as specified in the Nurse Schedule in section 7404(b) of this title. The Secretary shall, pursuant to regulations prescribed to carry out this subchapter, establish grades for other covered positions as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) For each grade in a covered position, there shall be a range of basic pay. The maximum rate of basic pay for a grade shall be 133 percent of the minimum rate of basic pay for the grade, except that, if the Secretary determines that a higher maximum rate is necessary with respect to any such grade in order to recruit and retain a sufficient number of high-quality health-care personnel, the Secretary may raise the maximum rate of basic pay for that grade to a rate not in excess of 175 percent of the minimum rate of basic pay for the grade. Whenever the Secretary exercises the authority under the <!-- PDFPage:633 -->preceding sentence to establish the maximum rate of basic pay at a rate in excess of 133 percent of the minimum rate for that grade, the Secretary shall, in the next annual report required by subsection (g), provide justification for doing so to the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The maximum rate of basic pay for any grade for a covered position may not exceed the maximum rate of basic pay established for positions in level V of the Executive Schedule under section 5316 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The range of basic pay for each such grade shall be divided into equal increments, known as &ldquo;steps&rdquo;. The Secretary shall prescribe the number of steps. Each grade in a covered position shall have the same number of steps. Rates of pay within a grade may not be established at rates other than whole steps. Any increase (other than an adjustment under subsection (d)) within a grade in the rate of basic pay payable to an employee in a covered position shall be by one or more of such step increments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The rates of basic pay for each grade in a covered position shall be adjusted periodically in accordance with this subsection in order to achieve the purposes of this section. Such adjustments shall be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) whenever there is an adjustment under section 5305 of title 5 in the rates of pay under the General Schedule, with the adjustment under this subsection to have the same effective date as the adjustment in the rates of basic pay under the General Schedule; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) at such additional times as the director of a Department health-care facility, with respect to employees in that grade at that facility, or the Under Secretary for Health, with respect to covered Regional and Central Office employees in that grade, determines.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An adjustment in rates of basic pay under this subsection for a grade shall be carried out by adjusting the amount of the minimum rate of basic pay for that grade in accordance with paragraph (3) and then adjusting the other rates for that grade to conform to the requirements of subsection (c). Such an adjustment in the minimum rate of basic pay for a grade shall be made by the director of a Department health-care facility so as to achieve consistency with the beginning rate of compensation for corresponding health-care professionals in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) labor-market area of that facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In the case of a Department health-care facility located in an area for which there is current information, based upon an industry-wage survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for that labor market, on beginning rates of compensation for corresponding health-care professionals for the BLS labor-market area of that facility, the director of the facility concerned shall use that information as the basis for making adjustments in rates of pay under this subsection. Whenever the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the results of a new industry-wage survey for that labor market that includes information on beginning rates of compensation for corresponding health-care professionals, the director of that facility shall determine, not later than 30 days after the results of the survey are released, whether an adjustment in rates of pay for employees at that facility for any covered position is necessary in order to meet the purposes of this section. If the director determines that such an adjustment is necessary, the adjustment, based upon the information determined in the survey, shall take effect on the first day of the first pay period beginning after that determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a Department health-care facility located in an area for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not have current information on beginning rates of compensation for corresponding health-care professionals for the labor-market area of that facility for any covered position, the director of that facility shall conduct a survey in accordance with this subparagraph and shall adjust the amount of the minimum rate of basic pay for grades in that covered position at that facility based upon that survey. Any such survey shall be conducted in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Those regulations shall be developed in consultation with the Secretary of Labor in order to ensure that the director of a facility collects information that is valid and reliable and is consistent with standards of the Bureau. The survey should be conducted using methodology comparable to that used by the Bureau in making industry-wage surveys except to the extent determined infeasible by the Secretary. Upon conducting a survey under this subparagraph, the director concerned shall determine, not later than 30 days after the date on which the collection of information through the survey is completed, whether an adjustment in rates of pay for employees at that facility for any covered position is necessary in order to meet the purposes of this section. If the director determines that such an adjustment is necessary, the adjustment, based upon the information determined in the survey, shall take effect on the first day of the first pay period beginning after that determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) A director of a Department health-care facility may use data on the beginning rates of compensation paid to certified registered nurse anesthetists who are employed on a salary basis by entities that provide anesthesia services through certified registered nurse anesthetists in the labor-market area only if the director&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) has conducted a survey of beginning rates of compensation for certified registered nurse anesthetists in the local labor-market area of the facility under subparagraph (B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) has used all available administrative authority with regard to collection of survey data; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) makes a determination (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) that such survey methods are insufficient to permit the adjustments referred to in subparagraph (B) for such nurse anesthetists employed by the facility.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For the purposes of this subparagraph, certified registered nurse anesthetists who are so employed by such entities shall be deemed to be corresponding health-care professionals to the certified registered nurse anesthetists employed by the facility.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:634 --><p class="statutory-body">(iii) The authority of the director to use such additional data under this subparagraph with respect to certified registered nurse anesthetists expires on January 1, 1998.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Under Secretary for Health shall prescribe regulations providing for the adjustment of the rates of basic pay for Regional and Central Office employees in covered positions in order to assure that those rates are sufficient and competitive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) The director of a facility or Under Secretary for Health may not adjust rates of basic pay under this subsection for any pay grade so that the minimum rate of basic pay for that grade is greater than the beginning rates of compensation for corresponding positions at non-Department health-care facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the director of a Department health-care facility, or the Under Secretary for Health with respect to Regional and Central Office employees, determines, after any survey under paragraph (3)(B) or at any other time that an adjustment in rates of pay is scheduled to take place under this subsection, that it is not necessary to adjust the rates of basic pay for employees in a grade of a covered position at that facility in order to carry out the purpose of this section, such an adjustment for employees at that facility in that grade shall not be made. Whenever a director makes such a determination, the director shall within 10 days notify the Under Secretary for Health of the decision and the reasons for the decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Information collected by the Department in surveys conducted under this subsection is not subject to disclosure under section 552 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;beginning rate of compensation&rdquo;, with respect to health-care personnel positions in non-Department health-care facilities corresponding to a grade of a covered position, means the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the minimum rate of pay established for personnel in such positions who have education, training, and experience equivalent or similar to the education, training, and experience required for health-care personnel employed in the same category of Department covered positions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) other employee benefits for those positions to the extent that those benefits are reasonably quantifiable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &ldquo;corresponding&rdquo;, with respect to health-care personnel positions in non-Department health-care facilities, means those positions for which the education, training, and experience requirements are equivalent or similar to the education, training, and experience requirements for health-care personnel positions in Department health-care facilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Adjustments in rates of basic pay under subsection (d) may increase or reduce the rates of basic pay applicable to any grade of a covered position. In the case of such an adjustment that reduces the rates of pay for a grade, an employee serving at a Department health-care facility on the day before the effective date of that adjustment in a position affected by the adjustment may not (by reason of that adjustment) incur a reduction in the rate of basic pay applicable to that employee so long as the employee continues to serve in that covered position at that facility. If such an employee is subsequently promoted to a higher grade, or advanced to a higher step within the employee's grade, for which the rate of pay as so adjusted is lower than the employee's rate of basic pay on the day before the effective date of the promotion, the employee shall continue to be paid at a rate of basic pay not less than the rate of basic pay applicable to the employee before the promotion so long as the employee continues to serve in that covered position at that facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Not later than February 1 of 1991, 1992, and 1993, the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives a report regarding any pay adjustments under the authority of subsection (d)(1)(A) effective during the 12 months preceding the submission of the report. Each such report shall set forth, by health-care facility, the percentage of such increases and, in any case in which no increase was made, the basis for not providing an increase.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Not later than December 1 of 1991, 1992, and 1993, the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives a report regarding the exercise of the authorities provided in this section for the preceding fiscal year. Each such report shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A review of the use of the authorities provided in this section (including the Secretary's and Under Secretary for Health's actions, findings, recommendations, and other activities under this section) during the preceding fiscal year, including an assessment of the effects of the exercise of such authorities on the ability of the Department to recruit and retain qualified health-care professionals for covered positions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The plans for the use of the authorities provided in this subchapter for the next fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A description of the rates of basic pay in effect during the preceding fiscal year, with a comparison to the rates in effect during the previous fiscal year, shown by facility and by covered position.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The numbers of employees in covered positions (shown separately for registered nurses and for each other covered position) who during the preceding fiscal year (A) left employment with the Department, (B) left employment at one Department medical facility for employment at another Department medical facility, or (C) changed from full-time status to part-time status (and from part-time status to full-time status), and a summary of the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The number of vacancies in covered positions in the Administration and a summary of the reasons that those positions are vacant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The number of employees who during the preceding fiscal year left employment at a health-care facility in one Bureau of Labor Statistics labor-market area for employment at a health-care facility in another such labor-market area, without changing residence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Justification for setting the maximum rate of basic pay for any grade at a rate in ex<!-- PDFPage:635 -->cess of 133 percent of the minimum rate of basic pay for that grade.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The discussion required by section 7452(b)(2) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The justification required by section 7452(e) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The number of nurses, shown by facility and by grade, who are on pay retention or in the top step of any grade and, with respect to those employees, comprehensive information (by facility) as to whether an extension of the pay grades was sought for these positions, and with respect to each such request for extension, whether such request was granted or denied.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) For the purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;health-care facility&rdquo; means a medical center, an independent outpatient clinic, or an independent domiciliary facility.</p>
