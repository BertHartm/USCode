<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the Court shall deposit in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund an amount equal to the additional amount it would have contributed to such Fund but for the election under subsection (d); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) if subparagraphs (C) and (D) of this paragraph are complied with, service on the Court shall be treated as service with respect to which deductions and contributions had been made during the period of service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) There shall be deducted and withheld each pay period from the pay of a judge who has made an election under subsection (b) of this section a sum equal to 3.5 percent of the judge's pay.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) at or before the time of the expiration of that term, the judge is eligible for and elects to receive retired pay under section 7296 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if the judge is survived by a surviving spouse but not by a dependent child, there shall be paid to the surviving spouse an annuity beginning with the day of the death of the judge or following the surviving spouse's attainment of the age of 50 years, whichever is the later, in an amount computed as provided in subsection (k) of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the judge is survived by a surviving spouse and a dependent child or children, there shall be paid to the surviving spouse an immediate annuity in an amount computed as provided in subsection (k) of this section and there shall also be paid to or on behalf of each such child an immediate annuity equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) 10 percent of the average annual pay of such judge (determined in accordance with subsection (k) of this section), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) 20 percent of such average annual pay, divided by the number of such children; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) if the judge is not survived by a surviving spouse but is survived by a dependent child or children, there shall be paid to or on behalf of each such child an immediate annuity equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) 20 percent of the average annual pay of such judge (determined in accordance with subsection (k) of this section), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) 40 percent of such average annual pay, divided by the number of such children.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The annuity payable to a surviving spouse under this subsection shall be terminated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) upon the surviving spouse's death; or</p>

In any case in which the annuity of a dependent child is terminated, the annuities of any remaining dependent child or children, based upon the service of the same judge, shall be recomputed and paid as though the child whose annuity was so terminated had not survived the judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Questions of family relationships, dependency, and disability arising under this section shall be determined in the same manner as such questions arising under chapter 84 of title 5 are determined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) If&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the right of all persons entitled to an annuity under subsection (f) of this section based on the service of such judge terminates before a claim for such benefits has been established,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the total amount credited to the individual account of such judge (with interest at 3 percent per year, compounded on December 31 of each year, to the date of the death of such judge) shall be paid in the manner specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An amount payable under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be paid, upon the establishment of a valid claim therefor, to the person or persons surviving at the date title to the payment arises, in the following order of precedence:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) To the beneficiary or beneficiaries whom the judge designated in writing filed before death with the chief judge (except that in the case of the chief judge such designation shall be filed before death as prescribed by the Court).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) To the surviving spouse of the judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) To the child or children of the judge (and the descendants of any deceased children by representation).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) To the parents of the judge or the survivor of them.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) To the executor or administrator of the estate of the judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) To such other next of kin of the judge as may be determined by the chief judge to be entitled under the laws of the domicile of the judge at the time of the judge's death.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Determination as to the surviving spouse, child, or parent of a judge for the purposes of paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be made without regard to the definitions in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Payment under this subsection in the manner provided in this subsection shall be a bar to recovery by any other person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In a case in which the annuities of all persons entitled to annuity based upon the service of a judge terminate before the aggregate <!-- PDFPage:572 -->amount of annuity paid equals the total amount credited to the individual account of such judge (with interest at 3 percent per year, compounded on December 31 of each year to the date of the death of the judge), the difference shall be paid, upon establishment of a valid claim therefor, in the order of precedence prescribed in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any accrued annuity remaining unpaid upon the termination (other than by death) of the annuity of any individual based upon the service of a judge shall be paid to that individual. Any accrued annuity remaining unpaid upon the death of an individual receiving an annuity based upon the service of a judge shall be paid, upon the establishment of a valid claim therefor, in the following order of precedence:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) To the executor or administrator of the estate of that person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) After 30 days after the date of the death of such individual, to such individual or individuals as may appear in the judgment of the chief judge to be legally entitled thereto.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such payment shall be a bar to recovery by any other individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) When a payment under this section is to be made to a minor, or to a person mentally incompetent or under other legal disability adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, the payment may be made to the person who is constituted guardian or other fiduciary by the law of the State of residence of such claimant or is otherwise legally vested with the care of the claimant or the claimant's estate. If no guardian or other fiduciary of the person under legal disability has been appointed under the laws of the State of residence of the claimant, the chief judge shall determine the person who is otherwise legally vested with the care of the claimant or the claimant's estate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Annuities under this section shall accrue monthly and shall be due and payable in monthly installments on the first business day of the month following the month or other period for which the annuity has accrued. An annuity under this section is not assignable, either in law or in equity, or subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) The annuity of the surviving spouse of a judge making an election under subsection (b) of this section shall be an amount equal to the sum of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) 1.5 percent of the judge's average annual pay; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the sum of the judge's years of judicial service, the judge's years of prior allowable service as a Member of Congress, the judge's years of prior allowable service performed as a member of the Armed Forces, and the judge's years, not exceeding 15, of prior allowable service performed as a congressional employee (as defined in section 2107 of title 5).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Three-fourths of 1 percent of the judge's average annual pay multiplied by the judge's years of allowable service not counted under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An annuity computed under this subsection may not exceed 50 percent of the judge's average annual pay and may not be less than 25 percent of such average annual pay. Such annuity shall be further reduced in accordance with subsection (d) of this section (if applicable).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;average annual pay&rdquo;, with respect to a judge, means the average annual pay received by the judge for judicial service (including periods in which the judge received retired pay under section 7296(d) of this title) or for any other prior allowable service during the period of three consecutive years in which the judge received the largest such average annual pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) Subject to subsection (d) of this section, the years of service of a judge which are allowable as the basis for calculating the amount of the annuity of the judge's surviving spouse shall include the judge's years of service as a judge of the Court, the judge's years of service as a Member of Congress, the judge's years of active service as a member of the Armed Forces not exceeding 5 years in the aggregate and not including any such service for which credit is allowed for the purposes of retirement or retired pay under any other provision of law, and the judge's years of any other civilian service within the purview of section 8332 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prevent a surviving spouse eligible therefor from simultaneously receiving an annuity under this section and any annuity to which such spouse would otherwise be entitled under any other law without regard to this section, but in computing such other annuity service used in the computation of such spouse's annuity under this section shall not be credited.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(n) A judge making an election under subsection (b) of this section shall, at the time of such election, waive all benefits under the civil service retirement laws except section 8440d of title 5. Such a waiver shall be made in the same manner and shall have the same force and effect as an election filed under section 7296(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>o</em>) Whenever the salaries of judges paid under section 7253(e) of this title are increased, each annuity payable from the retirement fund which is based, in whole or in part, upon a deceased judge having rendered some portion of that judge's final 18 months of service as a judge of the Court, shall also be increased. The amount of the increase in the annuity shall be determined by multiplying the amount of the annuity on the date on which the increase in salaries becomes effective by 3 percent for each full 5 percent by which those salaries were increased.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Amounts in the fund are available for the payment of judges&rsquo; retired pay under section 7296 of this title and of annuities, refunds, and allowances under section 7297 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Amounts deposited by, or deducted and withheld from the salary and retired pay of, a judge under section 7296 or 7297 of this title shall be deposited in the fund and credited to an individual account of the judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The chief judge of the Court of Veterans Appeals shall submit to the President an annual estimate of the expenditures and appropriations necessary for the maintenance and operation of the fund, and such supplemental and deficiency estimates as may be required from time to time for the same purposes, according to law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) The chief judge may cause periodic examinations of the retirement fund to be made by an actuary, who may be an actuary employed by another department of the Government temporarily assigned for the purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Subject to the availability of appropriations, there shall be deposited in the Treasury to the credit of the retirement fund, not later than the close of each fiscal year, such amounts as may be required to reduce to zero the unfunded liability (if any) of the fund. Such deposits shall be taken from sums available for that fiscal year for the payment of the expenses of the Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;unfunded liability&rdquo;, with respect to any fiscal year, means the amount estimated by the chief judge to be equal to the excess (as of the close of that fiscal year) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the present value of all benefits payable from the fund (determined on an annual basis in accordance with section 9503 of title 31), over</p>
