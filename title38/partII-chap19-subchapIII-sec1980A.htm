<p class="statutory-body">(4) A member shall not be considered for the purposes of this section to be a member insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance if the member is insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance only as an insurable dependent of another member pursuant to subparagraph (A)(ii) or (C)(ii) of section 1967(a)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A payment may be made to a member under this section only for a qualifying loss that results directly from a traumatic injury sustained while the member is covered against loss under this section and from no other cause.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) The cost attributable to insuring members under this section for any month or other period specified by the Secretary, less the premiums paid by the members, shall be paid by the Secretary concerned to the Secretary. The Secretary shall allocate the amount payable among the uniformed services using such methods and data as the Secretary determines to be reasonable and practicable. Payments under this paragraph shall be made on a monthly basis or at such other intervals as may be specified by the Secretary and shall be made within 10 days of the date on which the Secretary provides notice to the Secretary concerned of the amount required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) For each period for which a payment by a Secretary concerned is required under paragraph (6), the Secretary concerned shall contribute such amount from appropriations available for active duty pay of the uniformed service concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The sums withheld from the basic or other pay of members, or collected from them by the Secretary concerned, under this subsection, and the sums contributed from appropriations under this subsection, together with the income derived from any dividends or premium rate adjustments received from insurers shall be deposited to the credit of the revolving fund established in the Treasury of the United States under section 1869(d)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) When a claim for benefits is submitted under this section, the Secretary of Defense or, in the case of a member not under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary concerned, shall certify to the Secretary whether the member with respect to whom the claim is submitted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) was at the time of the injury giving rise to the claim insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance for the purposes of this section; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Payment for a loss resulting from traumatic injury may not be made under the insurance coverage under this section if the member dies before the end of a period prescribed by the Secretary, by regulation, for such purpose that begins on the date on which the member sustains the injury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a member eligible for a payment under this section dies before payment to the member can be made, the payment shall be made to the beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom the payment would be made if the payment were life insurance under section 1967(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Coverage for loss resulting from traumatic injury provided under this section shall cease at midnight on the date of the termination of the member's duty status in the uniformed services that established eligibility for Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance. The termination of coverage under this section is effective in accordance with the preceding sentence, notwithstanding any continuation after the date specified in that sentence of Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance coverage pursuant to section 1968(a) of this title for a period specified in that section.</p>
