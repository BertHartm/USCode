<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of paragraph (1), the capacity of the Department (and each geographic service area of the Veterans Health Administration) to provide for the specialized treatment and rehabilitative needs of disabled veterans within distinct programs or facilities shall be measured for veterans with spinal cord dysfunction, traumatic brain injury, blindness, or prosthetics and sensory aids as follows (with all such data to be provided by geographic service area and totaled nationally):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) For spinal cord injury and dysfunction specialized centers and for blind rehabilitation specialized centers, the number of staffed beds and the number of full-time equivalent employees assigned to provide care at such centers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For prosthetics and sensory aids, the annual amount expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) For traumatic brain injury, the number of patients treated annually and the amounts expended.</p>
