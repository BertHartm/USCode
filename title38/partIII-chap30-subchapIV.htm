<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an individual eligible for educational assistance under this chapter is enrolled under this chapter in an educational institution not regularly operated on the quarter or semester system and the period of such individual's entitlement under this chapter would, under section 3013, expire after a major portion of the course is completed, such period shall be extended to the end of the course or for 12 weeks, whichever is the lesser period of extension.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, an individual's last discharge or release from active duty shall not include any discharge or release from a period of active duty of less than 90 days of continuous service unless the individual involved is discharged or released for a service-connected disability, for a medical condition which preexisted such service and which <!-- PDFPage:313 -->the Secretary determines is not service connected, for hardship, or as a result of a reduction in force as described in section 3011(a)(1)(A)(ii)(III) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The amount of the educational assistance allowance payable to an individual described in subsection (a) of this section is the lesser of (1) the amount of the educational assistance allowance otherwise payable to such individual under this chapter, or (2) the established charges for tuition and fees that the educational institution involved requires similarly circumstanced nonveterans enrolled in the same program to pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the amount of the monthly educational assistance allowance payable to an individual pursuing a full-time program of apprenticeship or other on-job training under this chapter is&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for each of the months following the first 12 months of the individual's pursuit of such program, 35 percent of such monthly educational assistance allowance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any month in which an individual pursuing a program of education consisting of a program of apprenticeship or other on-job training fails to complete 120 hours of training, the amount of monthly educational assistance allowance payable under this chapter to the individual shall be limited to the same proportion of the applicable rate determined under paragraph (1) of this subsection as the number of hours worked during such month, rounded to the nearest eight hours, bears to 120 hours.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, for each month that an individual is paid a monthly educational assistance allowance under this chapter, the individual's entitlement under this chapter shall be charged at the rate of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any such charge to the individual's entitlement shall be reduced proportionately in accordance with the reduction in payment under paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1)(A) The amount of the educational assistance allowance payable under this chapter to an individual who enters into an agreement to pursue, and is pursuing, a program of education exclusively by correspondence is an amount equal to 55 percent of the established charge which the institution requires nonveterans to pay for the course or courses pursued by such individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;established charge&rdquo; means the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the charge for the course or courses determined on the basis of the lowest extended time payment plan offered by the institution and approved by the appropriate State approving agency; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such allowance shall be paid quarterly on a pro rata basis for the lessons completed by the individual and serviced by the institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In each case in which the rate of payment to an individual is determined under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the period of entitlement of such individual under this chapter shall be charged at the rate of one month for each payment of educational assistance to the individual that is equal to the amount of monthly educational assistance the individual would otherwise be eligible to receive for full-time pursuit of an institutional course under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, each individual who is pursuing a program of education consisting exclusively of flight training approved as meeting the requirements of section 3034(d) of this title shall be paid an educational assistance allowance under this chapter in the amount equal to 60 percent of the established charges for tuition and fees which similarly circumstanced nonveterans enrolled in the same flight course are required to pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No educational assistance allowance may be paid under this chapter to an individual for any month during which such individual is pursuing a program of education consisting exclusively of flight training until the Secretary has received from that individual and the institution providing such training a certification of the flight training received by the individual during that month and the tuition and other fees charged for that training.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The number of months of entitlement charged in the case of any individual for a program of education described in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be equal to the number (including any fraction) determined by dividing the total amount of educational assistance paid such individual for such program by the monthly rate of educational assistance which, except for paragraph (1) of this subsection, such individual would otherwise be paid under subsection (a)(1), (b)(1), (d), or (e)(1) of section 3015 of this title, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The number of solo flying hours for which an individual may be paid an educational assistance allowance under this subsection may not exceed the minimum number of solo flying hours required by the Federal Aviation Administration for the flight rating or certification which is the goal of the individual's flight training.</p>
