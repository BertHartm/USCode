The insurance shall be effective the first day of active duty or active duty for training, or the beginning of a period of inactive duty training scheduled in advance by competent authority, or the first day a member of the Ready Reserve meets the qualifications set forth in section 1965(5)(B) of this title, or the date certified by the Secretary to the Secretary concerned as the date Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance under this subchapter for the class or group concerned takes effect, whichever is the later date.</p>

In determining whether or not such individual was so authorized or required to perform such duty, and whether or not such member was rendered uninsurable or died within one hundred and twenty days thereafter from a disability so incurred or aggravated, there shall be taken into account the call or order to duty, the orders and authorizations of competent authority, the hour on which the member began to so proceed or to return, the hour on which such member was scheduled to arrive for, or on which such member ceased to perform such duty; the method of travel employed; such member's itinerary; the manner in which the travel was performed; and the immediate cause of disability or death. Whenever any claim is filed alleging that the claimant is entitled to benefits by reason of this subsection, the burden of proof shall be on the claimant.</p>

Any former member insured under Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance who again becomes eligible for Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance and declines such coverage solely for the purpose of maintaining such member's Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance in effect shall upon termination of coverage under Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance be automatically insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance, if otherwise eligible therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Whenever a member has the opportunity to make an election under subsection (a) not to be insured under this subchapter, or to be insured under this subchapter in an amount less than the maximum amount of $200,000, and at such other times periodically thereafter as the Secretary concerned considers appropriate, the Secretary concerned shall furnish to the member general information concerning life insurance. Such information shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the purpose and role of life insurance in financial planning;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the difference between term life insurance and whole life insurance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the availability of commercial life insurance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the relationship between Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance and Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The effective date and time for any change in benefits under the Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance Program shall be based on the date and time according to the time zone immediately west of the International Date Line.</p>
