<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) who is rendered uninsurable at standard premium rates according to the good health standards approved by the Secretary, or dies within one hundred and twenty days thereafter, from a disability, or aggravation of a preexisting disability, incurred by such member while proceeding directly to or returning directly from such active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training as the case may be;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be deemed to have been on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training, as the case may be, and to have been insured under this subchapter at the time such disability was incurred or aggravated, and if death occurs within one hundred and twenty days thereafter as a result of such disability to have been insured at the time of death. In determining whether or not such individual was so authorized or required to perform such duty, and whether or not such member was rendered uninsurable or died within one hundred and twenty days thereafter from a disability so incurred or aggravated, there shall be taken into account the call or order to duty, the orders and authorizations of competent authority, the hour on which the member began to so proceed or to return, the hour on which such member was scheduled to arrive for, or on which such member ceased to perform such duty; the method of travel employed; such member's itinerary; the manner in which the travel was performed; and the immediate cause of disability or death. Whenever any claim is filed alleging that the claimant is entitled to benefits by reason of this subsection, the burden of proof shall be on the claimant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If a person eligible for insurance under this subchapter is not so insured, or is insured for less than the maximum amount provided for the person under subparagraph (A) of subsection (a)(3), by reason of an election made by a member under subparagraph (B) of that subsection, the person may thereafter be insured under this subchapter in the maximum amount or any lesser amount elected as provided in such subparagraph (B) upon written application by the member, proof of good health of each person (other than a child) to be so insured, and compliance with such other terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary. Any former member insured under Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance who again becomes eligible for Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance and declines such coverage solely for the purpose of maintaining such member's Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance in effect shall upon termination of coverage under Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance be automatically insured under Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance, if otherwise eligible therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Whenever a member has the opportunity to make an election under subsection (a) not to be insured under this subchapter, or to be insured under this subchapter in an amount less than the maximum amount in effect under paragraph (3)(A)(i) of that subsection, and at such other times periodically thereafter as the Secretary concerned considers appropriate, the Secretary concerned shall furnish to the member general information concerning life insurance. Such information shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the purpose and role of life insurance in financial planning;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the difference between term life insurance and whole life insurance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the availability of commercial life insurance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the relationship between Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance and Veterans&rsquo; Group Life Insurance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The effective date and time for any change in benefits under the Servicemembers&rsquo; Group Life Insurance Program shall be based on the date and time according to the time zone immediately west of the International Date Line.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) If a member who is married and who is eligible for insurance under this section makes an election under subsection (a)(2)(A) not to be insured under this subchapter, the Secretary concerned shall notify the member's spouse, in writing, of that election.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a member who is married and who is insured under this section and whose spouse is designated as a beneficiary of the member under this subchapter, whenever the member makes an election under subsection (a)(3)(B) for insurance of the member in an amount that is less than the maximum amount provided under subsection (a)(3)(A)(i), the Secretary concerned shall notify the member's spouse, in writing, of that election&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of the first such election; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of any subsequent such election if the effect of such election is to reduce the amount of insurance coverage of the member from that in effect immediately before such election.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of a member who is married and who is insured under this section, if the member <!-- PDFPage:331 -->makes a designation under section 1970(a) of this title of any person other than the spouse or a child of the member as the beneficiary of the member for any amount of insurance under this subchapter, the Secretary concerned shall notify the member's spouse, in writing, that such a beneficiary designation has been made by the member, except that such a notification is not required if the spouse has previously received such a notification under this paragraph and if immediately before the new designation by the member under section 1970(a) of this title the spouse is not a designated beneficiary of the member for any amount of insurance under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A notification required by this subsection is satisfied by a good faith effort to provide the required information to the spouse at the last address of the spouse in the records of the Secretary concerned. Failure to provide a notification required under this subsection in a timely manner does not affect the validity of any election specified in paragraph (1) or (2) or beneficiary designation specified in paragraph (3).</p>
