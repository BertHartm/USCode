<p class="statutory-body">(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, each eligible veteran and eligible person may make not more than one change of program of education, but an eligible veteran or eligible person whose program has been interrupted or discontinued due to the veteran's or person's own misconduct, the veteran's or person's own neglect, or the veteran's or person's own lack of application shall not be entitled to any such change.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary, in accordance with procedures that the Secretary may establish, may approve a change other than a change under subsection (a) of this section (or an initial change in the case of a veteran or person not eligible to make a change under subsection (a)) in program if the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) For the purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;change of program of education&rdquo; shall not be deemed to include a change by a veteran or eligible person from the pursuit of one program to the pursuit of another program if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the veteran or eligible person has successfully completed the former program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the program leads to a vocational, educational, or professional objective in the same general field as the former program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the former program is a prerequisite to, or generally required for, pursuit of the subsequent program; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in the case of a change from the pursuit of a subsequent program to the pursuit of a former program, the veteran or eligible person resumes pursuit of the former program without loss of credit or standing in the former program.</p>
