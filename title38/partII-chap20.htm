<p class="statutory-body">(3) In a case in which the Secretary has authorized the provision of services, per diem payments under paragraph (1) may be paid retroactively for services provided not more than three days before the authorization was provided.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) During the five-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this section, paragraph (1) shall not apply to an entity that received a grant under section 3 of the Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Service Programs Act of 1992 (Public Law 102&ndash;590; 38 U.S.C. 7721 note)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2012_1_target" name="2012_1">1</a></sup> before that date if the entity meets fire and safety requirements established by the Secretary.</p>
