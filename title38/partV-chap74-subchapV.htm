<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Disciplinary Appeals Boards appointed under section 7464 of this title shall have exclusive jurisdiction to review any case&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) which arises out of (or which includes) a question of professional conduct or competence of a section 7401(1) employee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in which a major adverse action was taken.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The board shall include in its record of decision in any mixed case a statement of the board's exclusive jurisdiction under this subsection and the basis for such exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of paragraph (2), a mixed case is a case that includes both a major adverse action arising out of a question of professional conduct or competence and an adverse action which is not a major adverse action or which does not arise out of a question of professional conduct or competence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In any case in which charges are brought against a section 7401(1) employee which arises out of, or includes, a question of professional conduct or competence which could result in a major adverse action, the employee is entitled to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) At least 30 days advance written notice from the Under Secretary for Health or other charging official specifically stating the basis for each charge, the adverse actions that could be taken if the charges are sustained, and a statement of any specific law, regulation, policy, procedure, practice, or other specific instruction that has been violated with respect to each charge, except that the requirement for notification in advance may be waived if there is reasonable cause to believe that the employee has committed a crime for which the employee may be imprisoned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A reasonable time, but not less than seven days, to present an answer orally and in writing to the Under Secretary for Health or other deciding official, who shall be an official higher in rank than the charging official, and to submit affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the answer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case described in paragraph (1), the employee is entitled to be represented by an attorney or other representative of the employee's choice at all stages of the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If a proposed adverse action covered by this section is not withdrawn, the deciding official shall render a decision in writing within 21 days of receipt by the deciding official of the employee's answer. The decision shall include a statement of the specific reasons for the decision with respect to each charge. If a major adverse action is imposed, the decision shall state whether any of the charges sustained arose out of a question of professional conduct or competence. If any of the charges are sustained, the notice of the decision to the employee shall include notice of the employee's rights of appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding the 21-day period specified in subparagraph (A), a proposed adverse action may be held in abeyance if the employee requests, and the deciding official agrees, that the employee shall seek counseling or treatment for a condition covered under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Any such abeyance of a proposed action may not extend for more than one year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Secretary may require that any answer and submission under paragraph (1)(B) be submitted so as to be received within 30 days of the date of the written notice of the charges, except that the Secretary shall allow the granting of extensions for good cause shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall require that any appeal to a Disciplinary Appeals Board from a decision to impose a major adverse action shall be received within 30 days after the date of service of the written decision on the employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) When a Disciplinary Appeals Board convenes to consider an appeal in a case under this <!-- PDFPage:833 -->section, the board, before proceeding to consider the merits of the appeal, shall determine whether the case is properly before it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon hearing such an appeal, the board shall, with respect to each charge appealed to the board, sustain the charge, dismiss the charge, or sustain the charge in part and dismiss the charge in part. If the deciding official is sustained (in whole or in part) with respect to any such charge, the board shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) approve the action as imposed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) approve the action with modification, reduction, or exception; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) reverse the action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A board shall afford an employee appealing an adverse action under this section an opportunity for an oral hearing. If such a hearing is held, the board shall provide the employee with a transcript of the hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The board shall render a decision in any case within 45 days of completion of the hearing, if there is a hearing, and in any event no later than 120 days after the appeal commenced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) After resolving any question as to whether a matter involves professional conduct or competence, the Secretary shall cause to be executed the decision of the Disciplinary Appeals Board in a timely manner and in any event in not more than 90 days after the decision of the Board is received by the Secretary. Pursuant to the board's decision, the Secretary may order reinstatement, award back pay, and provide such other remedies as the board found appropriate relating directly to the proposed action, including expungement of records relating to the action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary finds a decision of the board to be clearly contrary to the evidence or unlawful, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reverse the decision of the board, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) vacate the decision of the board and remand the matter to the Board for further consideration.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Secretary finds the decision of the board (while not clearly contrary to the evidence or unlawful) to be not justified by the nature of the charges, the Secretary may mitigate the adverse action imposed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary's execution of a board's decision shall be the final administrative action in the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary may designate an employee of the Department to represent management in any case before a Disciplinary Appeals Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) A section 7401(1) employee adversely affected by a final order or decision of a Disciplinary Appeals Board (as reviewed by the Secretary) may obtain judicial review of the order or decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which judicial review is sought under this subsection, the court shall review the record and hold unlawful and set aside any agency action, finding, or conclusion found to be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary shall from time to time appoint boards to hear appeals of major adverse actions described in section 7462 of this title. Such boards shall be known as Disciplinary Appeals Boards. Each board shall consist of three employees of the Department, each of whom shall be of the same grade as, or be senior in grade to, the employee who is appealing an adverse action. At least two of the members of each board shall be employed in the same category of position as the employee who is appealing the adverse action. Members of a board shall be appointed from individuals on the panel established under subsection (d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In appointing a board for any case, the Secretary shall designate one of the members to be chairman and one of the members to be secretary of the board, each of whom shall have authority to administer oaths.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Appointment of boards, and the proceedings of such boards, shall be carried out under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. A verbatim record shall be maintained of board hearings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Notwithstanding sections 5701 and 7332 of this title, the chairman of a board, upon request of an employee whose case is under consideration by the board (or a representative of that employee) may, in connection with the considerations of the board, review records or information covered by those sections and may authorize the disclosure of such records or information to that employee (or representative) to the extent the board considers appropriate for purposes of the proceedings of the board in that case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any such case the board chairman may direct that measures be taken to protect the personal privacy of individuals whose records are involved. Any person who uses or discloses a record or information covered by this subsection for any purpose other than in connection with the proceedings of the board shall be fined not more than $5,000 in the case of a first offense and not more than $20,000 in the case of a subsequent offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Secretary shall provide for the periodic designation of employees of the Department who are qualified to serve on Disciplinary Appeals Boards. Those employees shall constitute the panel from which board members in a case are appointed. The Secretary shall provide (without charge) a list of the names of employees on the panel to any person requesting such list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall announce periodically, and not less often than annually, that the roster of employees on the panel is available as described in paragraph (1). Such announcement shall be made at Department medical facilities and through publication in the Federal Register. Notice of a name being on the list must be provided at least 30 days before the individual selected may serve on a Board or as a grievance examiner. Employees, employee organizations, and other interested parties may submit comments to the Secretary concerning the suitability for service on the panel of any employee whose name is on the list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall provide training in the functions and duties of Disciplinary Appeals Boards and grievance procedures under section 7463 of this title for employees selected to be on the panel.</p>
