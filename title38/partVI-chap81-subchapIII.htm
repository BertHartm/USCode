<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations for the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In those regulations, the Secretary shall prescribe for each State the number of nursing home and domiciliary beds for which assistance under this subchapter may be furnished. Such regulations shall be based on projected demand for such care 10 years after the date of the enactment of the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act by veterans who at such time are 65 years of age or older and who reside in that State. In determining such projected demand, the Secretary shall take into account travel distances for veterans and their families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In those regulations, the Secretary shall establish criteria under which the Secretary shall determine, with respect to an application for assistance under this subchapter for a project described in subparagraph (B) which is from a State that has a need for additional beds as determined under subsections (a)(2) and (d)(1), whether the need for such beds is most aptly characterized as great, significant, or limited. Such criteria shall take into account the availability of beds already operated by the Secretary and other providers which appropriately serve the needs which the State proposes to meet with its application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) This paragraph applies to a project for the construction or acquisition of a new State home facility, a project to increase the number of beds available at a State home facility, and a project to replace beds at a State home facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall review and, as necessary, revise regulations prescribed under paragraphs (2) and (3) not less often than every four years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary shall prescribe the following by regulation:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) General standards of construction, repair, and equipment for facilities constructed or acquired with assistance received under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) General standards for the furnishing of care in facilities which are constructed or acquired with assistance received under this subchapter, which standards shall be no less stringent than those standards prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to section 1720(b) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary may inspect any State facility constructed or acquired with assistance received under this subchapter at such times as the Secretary deems necessary to insure that such facility meets the standards prescribed under subsection (b)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) In prescribing regulations to carry out this subchapter, the Secretary shall provide that in the case of a State that seeks assistance under this subchapter for a project described in subsection (a)(3)(B), the determination of the unmet need for beds for State homes in that State shall be reduced by the number of beds in all previous applications submitted by that State under this subchapter, including beds which have not been recognized by the Secretary under section 1741 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Financial assistance under this subchapter for a renovation project may only be provided for a project for which the total cost of construction is in excess of $400,000 (as adjusted from time-to-time in such regulations to reflect changes in costs of construction).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, a renovation project is a project to remodel or alter existing buildings for which financial assistance under this subchapter may be provided and does not include maintenance and repair work which is the responsibility of the State.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may not accord any priority to a project for the construction or acquisition of a hospital; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The Secretary shall defer approval of an application that otherwise meets the requirements of this section if the State submitting the application does not, by the July 1 deadline (as defined in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph), demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the State has provided adequate financial support for construction of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In a case in which approval of an application is deferred under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall select for award of a grant or grants under this subsection an application or applications which would not have been approved during the fiscal year but for the deferral and to which the Secretary accords the highest priority under paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) An application deferred in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph shall be accorded priority in any subsequent fiscal year ahead of applications that had not been approved before the first day of the fiscal year in which the deferred application was first approved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For the purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;July 1 deadline&rdquo; means July 1 of the fiscal year in which the State is notified by the Secretary of the availability of funding for a grant for such project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) The Secretary may conditionally approve a project under this section, conditionally award a grant for the project, and obligate funds for the grant if the Secretary determines that the application for the grant is sufficiently complete to warrant awarding the grant and that, based on assurances provided by the State submitting the application, the State will complete the application and meet all the requirements referred to in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection by the date, not later than 180 days after the date of the conditional approval, specified by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If a State does not complete the application and meet all the requirements referred to in such paragraph by the date specified by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall rescind the conditional approval and award under such subparagraph and deobligate the funds previously obli<!-- PDFPage:937 -->gated in connection with the application. In the event the Secretary rescinds conditional approval of a project under this subparagraph, the Secretary may not further obligate funds for the project during the fiscal year in which the Secretary rescinds such approval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the Secretary may increase the amount of any grant awarded to any State for a project under this section by an amount by which the Secretary determines that the estimated cost of the construction or acquisition has increased from the estimated cost on which the Secretary based the determination to award the grant, without regard to the position of such project on the list established under paragraph (4) of this subsection, if the Secretary determines that the grant was awarded before the State entered into a contract for the construction or acquisition provided for in such project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A grant may not be increased under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph by more than 10 percent of the amount of the grant initially awarded for such project, and the amount of such grant, as increased, may not exceed 65 percent of the cost of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) No application submitted to the Secretary under this section shall be disapproved until the Secretary has afforded the applicant notice and an opportunity for a hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The amount of a grant under this subchapter shall be paid to the applicant or, if designated by the applicant, the State home for which such project is being carried out or any other agency or instrumentality of the applicant. Such amount shall be paid, in advance or by way of reimbursement, and in such installments consistent with the progress of the project as the Secretary may determine and certify for payment to the Secretary of the Treasury. Funds paid under this section for an approved project shall be used solely for carrying out such project as so approved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Any amendment of any application, whether or not approved, shall be subject to approval in the same manner as an original application.</p>
