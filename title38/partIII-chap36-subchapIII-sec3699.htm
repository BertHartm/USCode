<p class="statutory-body">(a) There is hereby established in the Treasury of the United States a revolving fund to be known as the &ldquo;Department of Veterans Affairs Education Loan Fund&rdquo; (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Fund&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Fund shall be available to the Secretary, without fiscal year limitation, for the making of loans under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) There shall be deposited in the Fund (1) by transfer from current and future appropriations for readjustment benefits such amounts as may be necessary to establish and supplement the Fund in order to meet the requirements of the Fund, and (2) all collections of fees and principal and interest (including overpayments declared under section 3698(e) of this title) on loans made under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary shall determine annually whether there has developed in the Fund a surplus which, in the Secretary's judgment, is more than necessary to meet the needs of the Fund, and such surplus, if any, shall be deemed to have been appropriated for readjustment benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A fee shall be collected from each veteran or person obtaining a loan made under this subchapter for the purpose of insuring against defaults on loans made under this subchapter; and no loan shall be made under this subchapter until the fee payable with respect to such loan has been collected and remitted to the Secretary. The amount of the fee shall be established from time to time by the Secretary, but shall in no event exceed 3 percent of the total loan amount. The amount of the fee may be included in the loan to the veteran or person and paid from the proceeds thereof.</p>
