<p class="statutory-body-1em">(s) If the veteran has a service-connected disability rated as total, and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, or, (2) by reason of such veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is permanently housebound, then the monthly compensation shall be $2,199. For the purpose of this subsection, the requirement of &ldquo;permanently housebound&rdquo; will be considered to have been met when the veteran is substantially confined to such veteran's house (ward or clinical areas, if institutionalized) or immediate premises due to a service-connected disability or disabilities which it is reasonably certain will remain throughout such veteran's lifetime.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Secretary determines that a presumption of service connection is not warranted, the Secretary, not later than 60 days after making the determination, shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of that determination. The notice shall include an explanation of the scientific basis for that determination. If the disease already is included in regulations providing for a presumption of service connection, the Secretary, not later than 60 days after publication of the notice of a determination that the presumption is not warranted, shall issue proposed regulations removing the presumption for the disease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 90 days after the date on which the Secretary issues any proposed regulations under this subsection, the Secretary shall issue final regulations. Such regulations shall be effective on the date of issuance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Whenever a disease is removed from regulations prescribed under this section&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Persian Gulf War Veterans&rsquo; Benefits</h4>
<p class="note-body">Sections 102 to 105, 107, 109, and 110 of title I of Pub. L. 103&ndash;446, as amended by Pub. L. 104&ndash;262, title III, &sect;352(a), Oct. 9, 1996, 110 Stat. 3210, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 102. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) During the Persian Gulf War, members of the Armed Forces were exposed to numerous potentially toxic substances, including fumes and smoke from military operations, oil well fires, diesel exhaust, paints, pesticides, depleted uranium, infectious agents, investigational drugs and vaccines, and indigenous diseases, and were also given multiple immunizations. It is not known whether these servicemembers were exposed to chemical or biological warfare agents. However, threats of enemy use of chemical and biological warfare heightened the psychological stress associated with the military operation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Significant numbers of veterans of the Persian Gulf War are suffering from illnesses, or are exhibit<!-- PDFPage:91 -->ing symptoms of illness, that cannot now be diagnosed or clearly defined. As a result, many of these conditions or illnesses are not considered to be service connected under current law for purposes of benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The National Institutes of Health Technology Assessment Workshop on the Persian Gulf Experience and Health, held in April 1994, concluded that the complex biological, chemical, physical, and psychological environment of the Southwest Asia theater of operations produced complex adverse health effects in Persian Gulf War veterans and that no single disease entity or syndrome is apparent. Rather, it may be that the illnesses suffered by those veterans result from multiple illnesses with overlapping symptoms and causes that have yet to be defined.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) That workshop concluded that the information concerning the range and intensity of exposure to toxic substances by military personnel in the Southwest Asia theater of operations is very limited and that such information was collected only after a considerable delay.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) In response to concerns regarding the health-care needs of Persian Gulf War veterans, particularly those who suffer from illnesses or conditions for which no diagnosis has been made, the Congress, in Public Law 102&ndash;585 [see Short Title of 1992 Amendments note under section 101 of this title], directed the establishment of a Persian Gulf War Veterans Health Registry, authorized health examinations for veterans of the Persian Gulf War, and provided for the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive review and assessment of information regarding the health consequences of military service in the Persian Gulf theater of operations and to develop recommendations on avenues for research regarding such health consequences. In Public Law 103&ndash;210 [see Tables for classification], the Congress authorized the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide health care services on a priority basis to Persian Gulf War veterans. The Congress also provided in Public Law 103&ndash;160 (the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994) [see Tables for classification] for the establishment of a specialized environmental medical facility for the conduct of research into the possible health effects of exposure to low levels of hazardous chemicals, especially among Persian Gulf veterans, and for research into the possible health effects of battlefield exposure in such veterans to depleted uranium.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In response to concerns about the lack of objective research on Gulf War illnesses, Congress included research provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 [Pub. L. 103&ndash;337, see Tables for classification], which was passed by the House and Senate in September 1994. This legislation requires the Secretary of Defense to provide research grants to non-Federal researchers to support three types of studies of the Gulf War syndrome. The first type of study will be an epidemiological study or studies of the incidence, prevalence, and nature of the illness and symptoms and the risk factors associated with symptoms or illnesses. This will include illnesses among spouses and birth defects and illnesses among offspring born before and after the Gulf War. The second group of studies shall be conducted to determine the health consequences of the use of pyridostigmine bromide as a pretreatment antidote enhancer during the Persian Gulf War, alone or in combination with exposure to pesticides, environmental toxins, and other hazardous substances. The final group of studies shall include clinical research and other studies on the causes, possible transmission, and treatment of Gulf War syndrome, and will include studies of veterans and their spouses and children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Further research and studies must be undertaken to determine the underlying causes of the illnesses suffered by Persian Gulf War veterans and, pending the outcome of such research, veterans who are seriously ill as the result of such illnesses should be given the benefit of the doubt and be provided compensation benefits to offset the impairment in earnings capacities they may be experiencing.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 103. PURPOSES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The purposes of this title [see Short Title of 1994 Amendments note under section 101 of this title] are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to provide compensation to Persian Gulf War veterans who suffer disabilities resulting from illnesses that cannot now be diagnosed or defined, and for which other causes cannot be identified;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop at the earliest possible date case assessment strategies and definitions or diagnoses of such illnesses;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to promote greater outreach to Persian Gulf War veterans and their families to inform them of ongoing research activities, as well as the services and benefits to which they are currently entitled; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to ensure that research activities and accompanying surveys of Persian Gulf War veterans are appropriately funded and undertaken by the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 104. DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICAL EVALUATION PROTOCOL.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Uniform Medical Evaluation Protocol</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall develop and implement a uniform and comprehensive medical evaluation protocol that will ensure appropriate medical assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of Persian Gulf War veterans who are suffering from illnesses the origins of which are (as of the date of the enactment of this Act [Nov. 2, 1994]) unknown and that may be attributable to service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War. The protocol shall include an evaluation of complaints relating to illnesses involving the reproductive system.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) If such a protocol is not implemented before the end of the 120-day period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act [Nov. 2, 1994], the Secretary shall, before the end of such period, submit to the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives a report as to why such a protocol has not yet been developed.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(3)(A) The Secretary shall ensure that the evaluation under the protocol developed under this section is available at all Department medical centers that have the capability of providing the medical assessment, diagnosis, and treatment required under the protocol.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(B) The Secretary may enter into contracts with non-Department medical facilities for the provision of the evaluation under the protocol.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(C) In the case of a veteran whose residence is distant from a medical center described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary may provide the evaluation through a Department medical center described in that subparagraph and, in such a case, may provide the veteran the travel and incidental expenses therefor pursuant to the provisions of section 111 of title 38, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(4)(A) If the Secretary is unable to diagnose the symptoms or illness of a veteran provided an evaluation, or if the symptoms or illness of a veteran do not respond to treatment provided by the Secretary, the Secretary may use the authority in section 1703 of title 38, United States Code, in order to provide for the veteran to receive diagnostic tests or treatment at a non-Department medical facility that may have the capability of diagnosing or treating the symptoms or illness of the veteran. The Secretary may provide the veteran the travel and incidental expenses therefor pursuant to the provisions of section 111 of title 38, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(B) The Secretary shall request from each non-Department medical facility that examines or treats a veteran under this paragraph such information relating to the diagnosis or treatment as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:92 --><p class="note-body">&ldquo;(5) In each year after the implementation of the protocol, the Secretary shall enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences under which agreement appropriate experts shall review the adequacy of the protocol and its implementation by the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Relationship to Other Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Protocols</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall ensure that the information collected through the protocol described in this section is collected and maintained in a manner that permits the effective and efficient cross-reference of that information with information collected and maintained through the comprehensive clinical protocols of the Department of Defense for Persian Gulf War veterans.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Case Definitions and Diagnoses</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall develop case definitions or diagnoses for illnesses associated with the service described in subsection (a)(1). The Secretary shall develop such definitions or diagnoses at the earliest possible date.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 105. OUTREACH TO PERSIAN GULF VETERANS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall implement a comprehensive outreach program to inform Persian Gulf War veterans and their families of the medical care and other benefits that may be provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense arising from service in the Persian Gulf War.</p>

This Act [amending this section, enacting provisions set out as notes under this section, and <!-- PDFPage:100 -->amending provisions set out as notes under this section and section 1116 of this title] may be cited as the &lsquo;Veterans&rsquo; Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act&rsquo;.</p>
<!-- field-end:shorttitle-note -->
<!-- field-start:miscellaneous-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Veterans who served in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era and veterans who participated in atmospheric nuclear tests or the American occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, Japan, are deeply concerned about possible long-term health effects of exposure to herbicides containing dioxin or to ionizing radiation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) There is scientific and medical uncertainty regarding such long-term adverse health effects.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In section 102 of Public Law 97&ndash;22 [see Tables for classification], the Congress responded to that uncertainty by authorizing priority medical care at Veterans&rsquo; Administration [now Department of Veterans Affairs] facilities for any disability of a veteran who may have been so exposed (even though there is insufficient medical evidence linking such disability with such exposure) unless the disability is found to have resulted from a cause other than the exposure.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The Congress has further responded to that medical and scientific uncertainty by requiring, in section 307 of Public Law 96&ndash;151 [set out as a note under section 1116 of this title] and section 601 of Public Law 98&ndash;160 [set out below], the conduct of thorough epidemiological studies of the health effects experienced by veterans in connection with exposure both to herbicides containing dioxin and (if not determined to be scientifically infeasible) to radiation, and by requiring in Public Law 97&ndash;414 [see Tables for classification], the development of radioepidemiological tables setting forth the probabilities of causation between various cancers and exposure to radiation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) There is some evidence that most types of leukemia, malignancies of the thyroid, female breast, lung, bone, liver, and skin, and polycythemia vera are associated with exposure to certain levels of ionizing radiation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) As of the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 24, 1984], there are sixty-six federally sponsored research projects being conducted relating to herbicides containing dioxin, at a cost to the Federal Government in excess of $130,000,000 and, as of 1981, federally sponsored research projects relating to ionizing radiation were costing the Federal Government more than $115,000,000.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The initial results of one project&mdash;an epidemiological study, conducted by the United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine, of the health status of the &lsquo;Ranch Hand&rsquo; veterans who carried out the loading and aerial spraying of herbicides containing dioxin in Vietnam and in the process came into direct skin contact with such herbicides in their most concentrated liquid form&mdash;were released on February 24, 1984, and contained the conclusion &lsquo;that there is insufficient evidence to support a cause and effect relationship between herbicide exposure and adverse health in the Ranch Hand group at this time&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The &lsquo;film badges&rsquo; which were originally issued to members of the Armed Forces in connection with the atmospheric nuclear test program have previously constituted a primary source of dose information for veterans (and survivors of veterans) filing claims for Veterans&rsquo; Administration [now Department of Veterans Affairs] disability compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation in connection with exposure to radiation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) These film badges often provide an incomplete measure of radiation exposure, since they were not capable of recording inhaled, ingested, or neutron doses (although the Defense Nuclear Agency currently has the capability to reconstruct individual estimates of such doses), were not issued to most of the participants in nuclear tests, often provided questionable readings because they were shielded during the detonation, and were worn for only limited periods during and after each nuclear detonation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Standards governing the reporting of dose estimates in connection with radiation-related claims for Veterans&rsquo; Administration [now Department of Veterans Affairs] disability compensation vary among the several branches of the Armed Forces, and no uniform minimum standards exist.</p>
