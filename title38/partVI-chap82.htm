<p class="statutory-body">(d) Payments made pursuant to grants under this chapter may be made in installments, and either in advance or by way of reimbursement, with necessary adjustments on account of overpayments or underpayments, as the Secretary may determine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) In carrying out the purposes of this chapter, the Secretary may lease to any eligible institution for such consideration and under such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate, such land, buildings, and structures (including equipment therein) under the control and jurisdiction of the Department as may be necessary. The three-year limitation on the term of a lease prescribed in section 8122(a) of this title shall not apply with respect to any lease entered into pursuant to this chapter, but no such lease may be for a period of more than 50 years. Any lease entered into pursuant to this chapter may be entered into without regard to the provisions of section 3709 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5). Notwithstanding section 1302 of title 40, or any other provision of law, a lease entered into pursuant to this chapter may provide for the maintenance, protection, or restoration, by the lessee, of the property leased, as a part or all of the consideration of the lease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) In making grants under this chapter, the Secretary shall give special consideration to applications from institutions which provide reasonable assurances, which shall be included in the grant agreement, that priority for admission to health manpower and training programs carried out by such institutions will be given to otherwise qualified veterans who during their military service acquired medical military occupation specialties, and that among such qualified veterans those who served during the Vietnam era and those who are entitled to disability compensation under laws administered by the Secretary or whose discharge or release was for a disability incurred or aggravated in line of duty will be given the highest priority. In carrying out this chapter and section 7302 of this title in connection with health manpower and training programs assisted or conducted under this title or in affiliation with a Department medical facility, the Secretary shall take appropriate steps to encourage the institutions involved to afford the priorities described in the first sentence of this subsection and to advise all qualified veterans with such medical military occupation specialties of the steps the Secretary has taken under this subsection and the opportunities available to them as a result of such steps.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Each recipient of assistance under this chapter shall keep such records as the Secretary shall prescribe, including records which fully disclose the amount and disposition by such recipient of the proceeds of such assistance, the total cost of the project or undertaking in connection with which such assistance is made or used, the amount of that portion of the cost of the project or undertaking supplied by other sources, and such records as will facilitate an effective audit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access for the purpose of audit and examination to any books, documents, papers, and records of the recipient of any assistance under this chapter which are pertinent to such assistance.</p>
