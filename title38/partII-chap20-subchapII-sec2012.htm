<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The rate for such per diem payments shall be the daily cost of care estimated by the grant recipient or eligible entity adjusted by the Secretary under subparagraph (B). In no case may the rate determined under this paragraph exceed the rate authorized for State homes for domiciliary care under subsection (a)(1)(A) of section 1741 of this title, as the Secretary may increase from time to time under subsection (c) of that section.</p>

No per diem payment may be provided to a grant recipient or eligible entity under this section unless the facilities of the grant recipient or eligible entity meet such standards as the Secretary shall prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Life Safety Code</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a per diem payment may not be provided under this section to a grant recipient or eligible entity unless the facilities of the grant recipient or eligible entity, as the case may be, meet applicable fire and safety requirements under the Life Safety Code of the National Fire Protection Association or such other comparable fire and safety requirements as the Secretary may specify.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) During the five-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this section, paragraph (1) shall not apply to an entity that received a grant under section 3 of the Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Service Programs Act of 1992 (Public Law 102&ndash;590; 38 U.S.C. 7721 note)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2012_1_target" name="2012_1">1</a></sup> before that date if the entity meets fire and safety requirements established by the Secretary.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Grant recipients or eligible entities that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) meet at least one, but not all, of the transitional and supportive services criteria prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (a)(1); and</p>
