<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) designate each Department health-care facility that as of August 26, 1980, was operating a geriatric research, education, and clinical center unless (on the recommendation of the Under Secretary for Health) the Secretary determines that such facility does not meet the requirements of subsection (c) or has not demonstrated effectiveness in carrying out the established purposes of such center or the purposes of title III of the Veterans&rsquo; Administration Health-Care Amendments of 1980 (Public Law 96&ndash;330; 94 Stat. 1048) or the potential to carry out such purposes effectively in the reasonably foreseeable future; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) assure appropriate geographic distribution of such facilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary may not designate a health-care facility as a location for a center under subsection (a) unless the peer review panel established under subsection (d) has determined under that subsection that the proposal submitted by such facility as a location for a new center under subsection (a) is among those proposals which have met the highest competitive standards of scientific and clinical merit, and the Secretary (upon the recommendation of the Under Secretary for Health) determines that the facility has (or may reasonably be anticipated to develop) each of the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The capability to conduct effectively evaluations of the activities of such center.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) In order to provide advice to assist the Secretary and the Under Secretary for Health in carrying out their responsibilities under this section, the Assistant Under Secretary for Health described in section 7306(b)(3) of this title shall establish a panel to assess the scientific and clinical merit of proposals that are submitted to the Secretary for the establishment of new centers under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The membership of the panel shall consist of experts in the fields of geriatric and gerontological research, education, and clinical care. Members of the panel shall serve as consultants to the Department for a period of no longer than six months.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) The panel shall not be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Before providing funds for the operation of any such center at a health-care facility other than a health-care facility designated under subsection (b)(1), the Secretary shall assure that the center at each facility designated under such subsection is receiving adequate funding to enable such center to function effectively in the areas of geriatric research, education, and clinical activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for the support of the research and education activities of the centers established pursuant to subsection (a). The Under Secretary for Health shall allocate to such centers from other funds appropriated generally for the Department medical care account and medical and prosthetics research account, as appropriate, such amounts as the Under Secretary for Health determines appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Activities of clinical and scientific investigation at each center established under subsection (a) shall be eligible to compete for the award of funding from funds appropriated for the Department medical and prosthetics research account and shall receive priority in the award of funding from such account insofar as funds are awarded to projects for research in geriatrics and gerontology.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">for damages for personal injury, including death, allegedly arising from malpractice or negligence of a medical care employee of the Administration in furnishing medical care or treatment while in the exercise of that employee's duties in or for the Administration shall be exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding by reason of the same subject matter against the medical care employee (or employee's estate) whose act or omission gave rise to such claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;medical care employee of the Administration&rdquo; means a physician, dentist, podiatrist, optometrist, nurse, physician assistant, expanded-function dental auxiliary, pharmacist, or paramedical (such as medical and dental technicians, nursing assistants, and therapists), or other supporting personnel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Attorney General shall defend any civil action or proceeding brought in any court against any person referred to in subsection (a) (or such person's estate) for any such damage or injury. Any such person against whom such civil action or proceeding is brought shall deliver within such time after date of service or knowledge of service as determined by the Attorney General, all process served upon such person or an attested true copy thereof to such person's immediate superior or to whomever was designated by the Secretary to receive such papers and such person shall promptly furnish copies of the pleading and process therein to the United States attorney for the district embracing the place wherein the proceeding is brought, to the Attorney General, and to the Secretary.</p>

After removal the United States shall have available all defenses to which it would have been entitled if the action had originally been commenced against the United States. Should a United States district court determine on a hearing on a motion to remand held before a trial on the merits that the employee whose act or omission gave rise to the suit was not acting within the scope of such person's office or employment, the case shall be remanded to the State court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Attorney General may compromise or settle any claim asserted in such civil action or proceeding in the manner provided in section 2677 of title 28, and with the same effect.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Indemnity under paragraph (1) is indemnity against either or both of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Liability (including reasonable expenses of litigation or settlement) to third persons, except liability under State or Federal workers&rsquo; injury compensation laws to employees of the contractor employed at the site of and in connection with the contract for which indemnification is granted, for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property, from a risk that the contract defines as unusually hazardous.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Loss of or damage to property of the contractor from a risk that the contract defines as unusually hazardous.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A contract that provides for indemnification in accordance with subsection (a) must also provide for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) notice to the United States of any claim or suit against the contractor for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) control of or assistance in the defense by the United States, at its election, of any such suit or claim for which indemnification is provided hereunder.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A payment may not be made under subsection (a) unless the Secretary certifies that the amount is just and reasonable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) funds obligated for the performance of the contract concerned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) funds available for research or development or both, and not otherwise obligated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) funds appropriated for those payments.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Each contractor which is a party to an indemnification agreement under subsection (a) shall have and maintain financial protection of such type and in such amounts as the Secretary shall require to cover liability to third persons and loss of or damage to the contractor's property. The amount of financial protection required shall be the maximum amount of insurance available from private sources, except that the Secretary may establish a lesser amount, taking into consideration the cost and terms of private insurance. Such financial protection may include private insurance, private contractual indemnities, self-insurance, other proof of financial responsibility, or a combination of such measures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) In administering the provisions of this section, the Secretary may use the facilities and services of private insurance organizations and may contract to pay a reasonable compensation therefor. Any contract made under the provisions of this section may be made without regard to the provisions of section 3709 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5), upon a showing by the Secretary that advertising is not reasonably practicable, and advance payments may be made under any such contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The authority to indemnify contractors under this section does not create any rights in third persons which would not otherwise exist by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Funds appropriated to carry out this section shall remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) In this section, the term &ldquo;contractor&rdquo; includes subcontractors of any tier under a contract containing an indemnification provision pursuant to subsection (a).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The content of any record referred to in subsection (a) may be disclosed by the Secretary in accordance with the prior written consent of the patient or subject with respect to whom such record is maintained, but only to such extent, under such circumstances, and for such purposes as may be allowed in regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whether or not any patient or subject, with respect to whom any given record referred to in subsection (a) is maintained, gives written consent, the content of such record may be disclosed by the Secretary as follows:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) In the case of any record which is maintained in connection with the performance of any program or activity relating to infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, to a Federal, State, or local public-health authority charged under Federal or State law with the protection of the public health, and to which Federal or State law requires disclosure of such record, if a qualified representative of such authority has made a written request that such record be provided as required pursuant to such law for a purpose authorized by such law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) A person to whom a record is disclosed under this paragraph may not redisclose or use such record for a purpose other than that for which the disclosure was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) If authorized by an appropriate order of a court of competent jurisdiction granted after application showing good cause therefor. In assessing good cause the court shall weigh the public interest and the need for disclosure against the injury to the patient or subject, to the physician-patient relationship, and to the treatment services. Upon the granting of such order, the court, in determining the extent to which any disclosure of all or any part of any record is necessary, shall impose appropriate safeguards against unauthorized disclosure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the event that the patient or subject who is the subject of any record referred to in subsection (a) is deceased, the content of any such record may be disclosed by the Secretary only upon the prior written request of the next of kin, executor, administrator, or other personal representative of such patient or subject and only if the Secretary determines that such disclosure is necessary for such survivor to obtain benefits to which such survivor may be entitled, including the pursuit of legal action, but then only to the extent, under such circumstances, and for such purposes as may be allowed in regulations prescribed pursuant to section 7334 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) The prohibitions of this section shall continue to apply to records concerning any person who has been a patient or subject, irrespective of whether or when such person ceases to be a patient.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The prohibitions of this section shall not prevent any interchange of records&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) within and among those components of the Department furnishing health care to veterans, or determining eligibility for benefits under this title; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a) but subject to paragraph (2), a physician or a professional counselor may disclose information or records indicating that a patient or subject is infected with the human immunodeficiency virus if the disclosure is made to (A) the spouse of the patient or subject, or (B) to an individual whom the patient or subject has, during the process of professional counseling or of testing to determine whether the patient or subject is infected with such virus, identified as being a sexual partner of such patient or subject.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A disclosure under paragraph (1) may be made only if the physician or counselor, after making reasonable efforts to counsel and encourage the patient or subject to provide the information to the spouse or sexual partner, reasonably believes that the patient or subject will not provide the information to the spouse or sexual partner and that the disclosure is necessary to protect the health of the spouse or sexual partner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A disclosure under such paragraph may be made by a physician or counselor other than the physician or counselor referred to in subparagraph (A) if such physician or counselor is unavailable by reason of absence or termination of employment to make the disclosure.</p>
