<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary may not in any fiscal year implement an administrative reorganization described in subsection (c) unless the Secretary first submits to the appropriate committees of the Congress a report containing a detailed plan and justification for the administrative reorganization. No action to carry out such reorganization may be taken after the submission of such report until the end of a 45-day period following the date of the submission of the report, not less than 30 days of which shall be days during which Congress shall have been in continuous session. For purposes of the preceding sentence, continuity of a session of Congress is broken only by adjournment sine die, and there shall be excluded from the computation of any period of continuity of session any day during which either House of Congress is not in session during an adjournment of more than three days to a day certain.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) For purposes of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;covered field office or facility&rdquo; means a Department office or facility outside the Central Office that is the permanent duty station for 25 or more employees or that is a free-standing outpatient clinic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;detailed plan and justification&rdquo; means, with respect to an administrative reorganization, a written report that, at a minimum, includes the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Specification of the number of employees by which each covered office or facility affected is to be reduced, the responsibilities of those employees, and the means by which the reduction is to be accomplished.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Identification of any existing or planned office or facility at which the number of employees is to be increased and specification of the number and responsibilities of the additional employees at each such office or facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) A description of the changes in the functions carried out at any existing office or facility and the functions to be assigned to an office or facility not in existence on the date that the plan and justification are submitted pursuant to subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) An explanation of the reasons for the determination that the reorganization is appropriate and advisable in terms of the statutory missions and long-term goals of the Department.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) A description of the effects that the reorganization may have on the provision of benefits and services to veterans and dependents of veterans (including the provision of benefits and services through offices and facilities of the Department not directly affected by the reorganization).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Estimates of the costs of the reorganization and of the cost impact of the reorganization, together with analyses supporting those estimates.</p>
