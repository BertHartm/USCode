<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Hospital care or medical services to a veteran for the treatment of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a service-connected disability;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Diagnostic services necessary for determination of eligibility for, or of the appropriate course of treatment in connection with, furnishing medical services at independent Department out-patient clinics to obviate the need for hospital admission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall allocate all amounts collected under this subsection with respect to a designated geographic service area of the Veterans Health Administration, net of payments to the contractor, to that region.</p>
