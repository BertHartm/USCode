<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The institution does not utilize advertising of any type which is erroneous or misleading, either by actual statement, omission, or intimation.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) The institution does not exceed its enrollment limitations as established by the State approving agency.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">if the Secretary determines, pursuant to regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, that such requirements would work an undue administrative hardship because the total amount of tuition, fees, and other charges at such institution is nominal.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3677. Approval of training on the job</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Any State approving agency may approve a program of training on the job (other than a program of apprenticeship) only when it finds that the job which is the objective of the training is one in which progression and appointment to the next higher classification are based upon skills learned through organized and supervised training on the job and not on such factors as length of service and normal turnover, and that the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section are met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The training establishment offering training which is desired to be approved for the purposes of this chapter must submit to the appropriate State approving agency a written application for approval which, in addition to furnishing such information as is required by the State approving agency, contains a certification that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the wages to be paid the eligible veteran or person (A) upon entrance into training, are not less than wages paid nonveterans in the same training position and are at least 50 per centum of the wages paid for the job for which the veteran or person is to be trained, and (B) such wages will be increased in regular periodic increments until, not later than the last full month of the training period, they will be at least 85 per centum of the wages paid for the job for which such eligible veteran or person is being trained; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there is reasonable certainty that the job for which the eligible veteran or person is to be trained will be available to the veteran or person at the end of the training period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) As a condition for approving a program of training on the job (other than a program of apprenticeship) the State approving agency must find upon investigation that the following criteria are met:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The training content of the course is adequate to qualify the eligible veteran or person for appointment to the job for which the veteran or person is to be trained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The job customarily requires full-time training for a period of not less than six months and not more than two years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The length of the training period is not longer than that customarily required by the training establishments in the community to provide an eligible veteran or person with the required skills, arrange for the acquiring of job knowledge, technical information, and other facts which the eligible veteran or person will need to learn in order to become competent on the job for which the veteran or person is being trained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Provision is made for related instruction for the individual eligible veteran or person who may need it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) There is in the training establishment adequate space, equipment, instructional material, and instructor personnel to provide satisfactory training on the job.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Adequate records are kept to show the progress made by each eligible veteran or person toward such veteran's or person's job objective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) No course of training will be considered bona fide if given to an eligible veteran or person who is already qualified by training and experience for the job.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) A signed copy of the training agreement for each eligible veteran or person, including the training program and wage scale as approved by the State approving agency, is provided to the veteran or person and to the Secretary and the State approving agency by the employer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the eligible veteran or person withdraws because he or she is ordered to active duty; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary finds there are mitigating circumstances, except that, in the first instance of withdrawal (without regard to withdrawals described in subclause (A) of this clause) by the eligible veteran or person from a course or courses with respect to which the veteran or person has been paid assistance under this title, mitigating circumstances shall be considered to exist with respect to courses totaling not more than six semester hours or the equivalent thereof.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary may, subject to such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe, continue to pay allowances to eligible veterans and eligible persons enrolled in courses set forth in clause (1) of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) during periods when the schools are temporarily closed under an established policy based upon an Executive order of the President or due to an emergency situation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) during periods between consecutive school terms where such veterans or persons transfer from one approved educational institution to another approved educational institution for the purpose of enrolling in and pursuing a similar course at the second institution if the period between such consecutive terms does not exceed 30 days; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) during periods between a semester, term, or quarter where the educational institution certifies the enrollment of the eligible veteran or eligible person on an individual semester, term, or quarter basis if the interval between such periods does not exceed one full calendar month.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) No educational assistance allowance shall be paid to an eligible veteran or spouse or surviving spouse enrolled in and pursuing a program of education exclusively by correspondence until the Secretary shall have received&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) from the training establishment a certification, or an endorsement on the veteran's or person's certificate, that such veteran or person was enrolled in and pursuing a program of apprenticeship or other on-job training during such period.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Advance Payment of Initial Educational Assistance or Subsistence Allowance</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The educational assistance or subsistence allowance advance payment provided for in this subsection is based upon a finding by the Congress that eligible veterans and eligible persons may need additional funds at the beginning of a school term to meet the expenses of books, travel, deposits, and payment for living quarters, the initial installment of tuition, and the other special expenses which are concentrated at the beginning of a school term.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to the provisions of this subsection, and under regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, an eligible veteran or eligible person shall be paid an educational assistance allowance or subsistence allowance, as appropriate, advance payment. Such advance payment shall be made in an amount equivalent to the allowance for the month or fraction thereof in which pursuit of the program will commence, plus the allowance for the succeeding month. In the case of a person on active duty, who is pursuing a program of education, the advance payment shall be in a lump sum based upon the amount payable for the entire quarter, semester, or term, as applicable. In no event shall an advance payment be made under this subsection to a veteran or person intending to pursue a program of education on less than a half-time basis. An advance payment may not be made under this subsection to any veteran or person unless the veteran or person requests such payment and the Secretary finds that the educational institution at which such veteran or person is accepted or enrolled has agreed to, and can satisfactorily, carry out the provisions of paragraphs (4)(B) and (C) and (5) of this subsection. The application for advance payment, to be made on a form prescribed by the Secretary, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of an initial enrollment of a veteran or person in an educational institution, contain information showing that the veteran or person (i) is eligible for educational benefits, (ii) has been accepted by the institution, and (iii) has notified the institution of such veteran's or person's intention to attend that institution; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a re-enrollment of a veteran or person, contain information showing that the veteran or person (i) is eligible to continue such veteran's or person's program of education or training and (ii) intends to re-enroll in the same institution,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:375 --><p class="statutory-body-block">and, in either case, shall also state the number of semester or clock-hours to be pursued by such veteran or person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of the Secretary's determination whether any veteran or person is eligible for an advance payment under this section, the information submitted by the institution, the veteran or person, shall establish such veteran's or person's eligibility unless there is evidence in such veteran's or person's file in the processing office establishing that the veteran or person is not eligible for such advance payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The advance payment authorized by paragraph (2) of this subsection shall, in the case of an eligible veteran or eligible person, be (A) drawn in favor of the veteran or person; (B) mailed to the educational institution listed on the application form for temporary care and delivery to the veteran or person by such institution; and (C) delivered to the veteran or person upon such veteran's or person's registration at such institution, but in no event shall such delivery be made earlier than thirty days before the program of education is to commence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Upon delivery of the advance payment pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection, the institution shall submit to the Secretary a certification of such delivery. If such delivery is not effected within thirty days after commencement of the program of education in question, such institution shall return such payment to the Secretary forthwith.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Recovery of Erroneous Payments</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), if an eligible veteran or eligible person fails to enroll in or pursue a course for which an educational assistance or subsistence allowance advance payment is made, the amount of such payment and any amount of subsequent payments which, in whole or in part, are due to erroneous information required to be furnished under subsection (d)(2) of this section, shall become an overpayment and shall constitute a liability of such veteran or person to the United States and may be recovered, unless waived pursuant to section 5302 of this title, from any benefit otherwise due such veteran or person under any law administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs or may be recovered in the same manner as any other debt due the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the recovery of an overpayment of an educational allowance or subsistence allowance advance payment to an eligible veteran or eligible person who fails to enroll in or pursue a course of education for which the payment is made if such failure is due to the death of the veteran or person.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Payments for Less Than Half-Time Training</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Payment of educational assistance allowance in the case of any eligible veteran or eligible person pursuing a program of education on less than a half-time basis shall be made in an amount computed for the entire quarter, semester, or term not later than the last day of the month immediately following the month in which certification is received from the educational institution that such veteran or person has enrolled in and is pursuing a program at such institution. Such lump sum payment shall be computed at the rate provided in section 3482(b) or 3532(a)(2) of this title, as applicable.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Determination of Enrollment, Pursuit, and Attendance</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Secretary may, pursuant to regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, determine and define enrollment in, pursuit of, and attendance at, any program of education or training or course by an eligible veteran or eligible person for any period for which the veteran or person receives an educational assistance or subsistence allowance under this chapter for pursuing such program or course. Subject to such reports and proof as the Secretary may require to show an eligible veteran's or eligible person's enrollment in and satisfactory pursuit of such person's program, the Secretary may withhold payment of benefits to such eligible veteran or eligible person until the required proof is received and the amount of the payment is appropriately adjusted. The Secretary may accept such veteran's or person's monthly certification of enrollment in and satisfactory pursuit of such veteran's or person's program as sufficient proof of the certified matters.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the veteran or eligible person and the educational institution offering a course in which such veteran or eligible person is enrolled under chapter 31, 34,,<sup><a href="#3684_1_target" name="3684_1">1</a></sup> 35, or 36 of this title shall, without delay, report to the Secretary, in the form prescribed by the Secretary, such enrollment and any interruption or termination of the education of each such veteran or eligible person. The date of such interruption or termination will be the last date of pursuit, or, in the case of correspondence training, the last date a lesson was serviced by a school.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the case of a program of independent study pursued on less than a half-time basis in an educational institution, the Secretary may approve a delay by the educational institution in reporting the enrollment or reenrollment of an eligible veteran or eligible person until the end of the term, quarter, or semester if the educational institution requests the delay and the Secretary determines that it is not feasible for the educational institution to monitor interruption or termination of the veteran's or eligible person's pursuit of such program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An educational institution which, pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, is delaying the reporting of the enrollment or reenrollment of a veteran shall provide the veteran with notice of the delay at the time that the veteran enrolls or reenrolls.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, an educational institution offering courses on a term, quarter, or semester basis may certify the enrollment of a veteran who is not on active duty, or of an eligible person, in such courses for more than one term, quarter, or semester at a time, but not for a period extending beyond the end of a school year (including the summer enrollment period).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to any term, quarter, or semester for which the veteran or eligible person is enrolled on a less than half-time basis and shall not be construed as restricting the Secretary from requiring that an educational institution, in reporting an enrollment for more than one term, quarter, or semester, specify the dates of any intervals within or between any such terms, quarters, or semesters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary, prior to making payment of a reporting fee to an educational institution, as provided for in subsection (c) of this section, shall require such institution to certify that it has exercised reasonable diligence in determining whether such institution or any course offered by such institution approved for the enrollment of veterans or eligible persons meets <!-- PDFPage:381 -->all of the applicable requirements of chapters 31, 34, 35, and 36 of this title and that it will, without delay, report any failure to meet any such requirement to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary may pay to any educational institution, or to any joint apprenticeship training committee acting as a training establishment, furnishing education or training under either this chapter or chapter 31, 34, or 35 of this title, a reporting fee which will be in lieu of any other compensation or reimbursement for reports or certifications which such educational institution or joint apprenticeship training committee is required to submit to the Secretary by law or regulation. Such reporting fee shall be computed for each calendar year by multiplying $7 by the number of eligible veterans or eligible persons enrolled under this chapter or chapter 31, 34, or 35 of this title, or $11 in the case of those eligible veterans and eligible persons whose educational assistance checks are directed in care of each institution for temporary custody and delivery and are delivered at the time of registration as provided under section 3680(d)(4) of this title, on October 31 of that year; except that the Secretary may, where it is established by such educational institution or joint apprenticeship training committee that eligible veteran plus eligible person enrollment on such date varies more than 15 percent from the peak eligible veteran enrollment plus eligible person enrollment in such educational institution or joint apprenticeship training committee during such calendar year, establish such other date as representative of the peak enrollment as may be justified for such educational institution or joint apprenticeship training committee. The reporting fee shall be paid to such educational institution or joint apprenticeship training committee as soon as feasible after the end of the calendar year for which it is applicable. No reporting fee payable to an educational institution under this subsection shall be subject to offset by the Secretary against any liability of such institution for any overpayment for which such institution may be administratively determined to be liable under section 3685 of this title unless such liability is not contested by such institution or has been upheld by a final decree of a court of appropriate jurisdiction.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Each eligible veteran (as defined in section 3452(a)(1) and (2) of this title) and each eligible spouse or surviving spouse (as defined in section 3501(a)(1)(B), (C), or (D) of this title) who enters into an enrollment agreement to pursue a program of education exclusively by correspondence shall be paid an educational assistance allowance computed at the rate of 55 percent of the established charge which the institution requires nonveterans to pay for the course or courses pursued by the eligible veteran or spouse or surviving spouse. The term &ldquo;established charge&rdquo; as used herein means the charge for the course or courses determined on the basis of the lowest extended time payment plan offered by the institution and approved by the appropriate State approving agency or the actual cost to the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse, whichever is the lesser. Such allowance shall be paid quarterly on a pro rata basis for the lessons completed by the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse and serviced by the institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The period of entitlement of any veteran or spouse or surviving spouse who is pursuing any program of education exclusively by correspondence shall be charged with one month for each $376 which is paid to the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse as an educational assistance allowance for such course.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law unless enacted in express limitation of this paragraph, funds in the Department of Veterans Affairs readjustment benefits account shall be available for payments under paragraph (1) of this subsection for pursuit of a program of education exclusively by correspondence in which the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse enrolls after September 30, 1981.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The enrollment agreement shall fully disclose the obligation of both the institution and the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse and shall prominently display the provisions for affirmance, termination, refunds, and the conditions under which payment of the allowance is made by the Secretary to the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse. A copy of the enrollment agreement shall be furnished to each such veteran or spouse or surviving spouse at the time such veteran or spouse or surviving spouse signs such agreement. No such agreement shall be effective unless such veteran or spouse or surviving spouse shall, after the expiration of ten days after the enrollment agreement is signed, have signed and submitted to the Secretary a written statement, with a signed copy to the institution, specifically affirming the enrollment agreement. In the event the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse at any time notifies the institution of such veteran's or spouse's intention not to affirm the agreement in accordance with the preceding sentence, the institution, without imposing any penalty or charging any fee shall promptly make a full refund of all amounts paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In the event a veteran or spouse or surviving spouse elects to terminate such veteran's or spouse's enrollment under an affirmed enrollment agreement, the institution may charge the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse a registration or similar fee not in excess of 10 percent of the tuition for the course, or $50, whichever is less. Where the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse elects to terminate the agreement after completion of one or more but less than 25 percent of the total number of lessons comprising the course, the institution may retain such registration or similar fee plus 25 percent of the tuition for the course. Where the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse elects to terminate the agreement after completion of 25 percent but less than 50 percent of the lessons comprising the course, the institution may retain the full registration or similar fee plus 50 percent of the course tuition. If 50 percent or more of the lessons are completed, no refund of tuition is required.</p>

<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Overcharges by Educational Institutions</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) If the Secretary finds that an educational institution has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) charged or received from any eligible veteran or eligible person pursuing a program of education under this chapter or chapter 34 or 35 of this title any amount for any course in excess of the charges for tuition and fees which such institution requires similarly circumstanced nonveterans not receiving assistance under such chapters who are enrolled in the same course to pay, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) instituted, after October 24, 1972, a policy or practice with respect to the payment of tuition, fees, or other charges in the case of eligible veterans and the Secretary finds that the effect of such policy or practice substantially denies to veterans the benefits of the advance allowances under such section,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Secretary may disapprove such educational institution for the enrollment of any eligible <!-- PDFPage:390 -->veteran or eligible person not already enrolled therein under this chapter or chapter 31, 34, or 35 of this title.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Discontinuance of Allowances</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary may discontinue the educational assistance allowance of any eligible veteran or eligible person if the Secretary finds that the program of education or any course in which the veteran or person is enrolled fails to meet any of the requirements of this chapter or chapter 34 or 35 of this title, or if the Secretary finds that the educational institution offering such program or course has violated any provision of this chapter or chapter 34 or 35 of this title, or fails to meet any of the requirements of such chapters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, any action by the Secretary under paragraph (1) of this subsection to discontinue (including to suspend) assistance provided to any eligible veteran or eligible person under this chapter or chapter 31, 32, 34, or 35 of this title shall be based upon evidence that the veteran or eligible person is not or was not entitled to such assistance. Whenever the Secretary so discontinues any such assistance, the Secretary shall concurrently provide written notice to such veteran or person of such discontinuance and that such veteran or person is entitled thereafter to a statement of the reasons for such action and an opportunity to be heard thereon.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary may suspend educational assistance to eligible veterans and eligible persons already enrolled, and may disapprove the enrollment or reenrollment of any eligible veteran or eligible person, in any course as to which the Secretary has evidence showing a substantial pattern of eligible veterans or eligible persons, or both, who are receiving such assistance by virtue of their enrollment in such course but who are not entitled to such assistance because (i) the course approval requirements of this chapter are not being met, or (ii) the educational institution offering such course has violated one or more of the recordkeeping or reporting requirements of this chapter or chapter 30, 32, 34, or 35 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Action may be taken under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph only after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Secretary provides to the State approving agency concerned and the educational institution concerned written notice of any such failure to meet such approval requirements and any such violation of such recordkeeping or reporting requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) such institution refuses to take corrective action or does not within 60 days after such notice (or within such longer period as the Secretary determines is reasonable and appropriate) take corrective action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the Secretary, not less than 30 days before taking action under such subparagraph, provides to each eligible veteran and eligible person already enrolled in such course written notice of the Secretary's intent to take such action (and the reasons therefor) unless such corrective action is taken within such 60 days (or within such longer period as the Secretary has determined is reasonable and appropriate), and of the date on which the Secretary intends to take action under such subparagraph.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Examination of Records</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the records and accounts of educational institutions pertaining to eligible veterans or eligible persons who received educational assistance under this chapter or chapter 31, 32, 34, or 35 of this title, as well as the records of other students which the Secretary determines necessary to ascertain institutional compliance with the requirements of such chapters, shall be available for examination by duly authorized representatives of the Government.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">False or Misleading Statements</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Whenever the Secretary finds that an educational institution has willfully submitted a false or misleading claim, or that a veteran or person, with the complicity of an educational institution, has submitted such a claim, the Secretary shall make a complete report of the facts of the case to the appropriate State approving agency and, where deemed advisable, to the Attorney General of the United States for appropriate action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, each eligible veteran shall be entitled to a loan under this subchapter (if the program of education is pursued in a State) in an amount determined under, and subject to the conditions specified in, subsection (b)(1) of this section if the veteran satisfies the requirements set forth in subsection (c) of this section and the criteria established under subsection (g) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except in the case of a veteran to whom section 3462(a)(2) of this title is applicable, no loan may be made under this subchapter after September 30, 1981.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, the amount of the loan to which an eligible veteran shall be entitled under this subchapter for any academic year shall be equal to the amount needed by such veteran to pursue a program of education at the institution at which the veteran is enrolled, as determined under paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The amount needed by a veteran to pursue a program of education at an institution for any academic year shall be determined by subtracting (i) the total amount of financial resources (as defined in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph) available to the veteran which may be reasonably expected to be expended by such veteran for educational purposes in any year from (ii) the actual cost of attendance (as defined in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph) at the institution in which such veteran is enrolled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The term &ldquo;total amount of financial resources&rdquo; of any veteran for any year means the total of the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The amount of financial assistance received by the veteran under the provisions of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Educational assistance received by the veteran under this title other than under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) Financial assistance received by the veteran under any scholarship or grant program other than those specified in clauses (iii) and (iv).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The term &ldquo;actual cost of attendance&rdquo; means, subject to such regulations as the Secretary may provide, the actual per-student charges for tuition, fees, room and board (or expenses related to reasonable commuting), books, and an allowance for such other expenses as the Secretary determines by regulation to be reasonably related to attendance at the institution at which the veteran is enrolled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The aggregate of the amounts any veteran may borrow under this subchapter may not exceed $376 multiplied by the number of months such veteran is entitled to receive educational assistance under section 3461 of this title, but not in excess of $2,500 in any one regular academic year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) An eligible veteran shall be entitled to a loan under this subchapter if such veteran&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is in attendance at an educational institution on at least a half-time basis and (A) is enrolled in a course leading to a standard college degree, or (B) is enrolled in a course, the completion of which requires six months or longer, leading to an identified and predetermined professional or vocational objective, except that the Secretary may waive the requirements of subclause (B) of this clause, in whole or in part, if the Secretary determines, pursuant to regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, it to be in the interest of the eligible veteran and the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) enters into an agreement with the Secretary meeting the requirements of subsection (d) of this section; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">No loan shall be made under this subchapter to an eligible veteran pursuing a program of correspondence, or apprenticeship or other on-job training.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Any agreement between the Secretary and a veteran under this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall include a note or other written obligation which provides for repayment to the Secretary of the principal amount of, and payment of interest on, the loan in installments (A) over a period beginning nine months after the date on which the borrower ceases to be at least a half-time student and ending ten years and nine months after such date, or (B) over such shorter period as the Secretary may have prescribed under subsection (g) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall include provision for acceleration of repayment of all or any part of the loan, without penalty, at the option of the borrower;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall provide that the loan shall bear interest, on the unpaid balance of the loan, at a rate prescribed by the Secretary, at the time the loan is contracted for which rate shall be comparable to the rate of interest charged students at such time on loans insured by the Secretary of Education under part B of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, but in no event shall the rate so prescribed by the Secretary exceed the rate charged students on such insured loans, and shall provide that no interest shall accrue prior to the beginning date of repayment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) shall provide that the loan shall be made without security and without endorsement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, whenever the Secretary determines that a default has occurred on any loan made under this subchapter, the Secretary shall declare an overpayment, and such overpayment shall be recovered from the veteran concerned in the same manner as any other debt due the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a veteran who has received a loan under this section dies or becomes permanently and totally disabled, then the Secretary shall discharge the veteran's liability on such loan by repaying the amount owed on such loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Payment of a loan made under this section shall be drawn in favor of the eligible veteran and mailed promptly to the educational institution in which such veteran is enrolled. Such institution shall deliver such payment to the eligible veteran as soon as practicable after receipt thereof. Upon delivery of such payment to the eligible veteran, such educational institution shall promptly submit to the Secretary a certification, on such form as the Secretary shall prescribe, of such delivery, and such delivery shall be deemed to be an advance payment under section 3680(d)(4) of this title for purposes of section 3684(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) The Secretary shall conduct, on a continuing basis, a review of the default experience with respect to loans made under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) To ensure that loans are made under this section on the basis of financial need directly related to the costs of education, the Secretary may, by regulation, establish (i) criteria for eligibility for such loans, in addition to the criteria and requirements prescribed by subsections (c) and (d) of this section, in order to limit eligibility for such loans to eligible veterans attending educational institutions with relatively high rates of tuition and fees, and (ii) criteria under which the Secretary may prescribe a repayment period for certain types of loans made under this section that is shorter than the repayment period otherwise applicable under subsection (d)(1)(A) of this section. Criteria established by the Secretary under clause (i) of the preceding sentence may include a minimum amount of tuition and fees that an eligible veteran may pay in order to be eligible for such a loan (except that any such criterion shall not apply with respect to a loan for which the veteran is eligible as a result of an extension of the period of eligibility of such veteran for loans under this section provided for by section 3462(a)(2) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In prescribing regulations under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall take into consideration information developed in the course of the review required by paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Regulations may be prescribed under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph only after opportunity has been afforded for public comment thereon.</p>
