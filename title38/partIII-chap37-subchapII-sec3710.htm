<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A loan to a veteran may be guaranteed by the Secretary under this chapter for the purpose specified in clause (8) of subsection (a) of this section without regard to the amount of outstanding guaranty entitlement available for use by such veteran, and the amount of such veteran's guaranty entitlement shall not be charged as a result of any guaranty provided for such purpose.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purpose of determining whether a veteran meets the standards referred to in subsection (b)(3) of this section and section 3712(e)(2) of this title, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations which establish&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) credit underwriting standards to be used in evaluating loans to be guaranteed under this chapter; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Any lender making a loan under this chapter shall certify, in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe, that the lender has complied with the credit information and loan processing standards established under paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection, and that, to the best of the lender's knowledge and belief, the loan meets the underwriting standards established under paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any lender who knowingly and willfully makes a false certification under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty equal to two times the amount of the Secretary's loss on the loan involved or to another appropriate amount, not to exceed $10,000, whichever is greater. All determinations necessary to carry out this subparagraph shall be made by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Pursuant to regulations prescribed to carry out this paragraph, the Secretary may, in extraordinary situations, waive the application of the credit underwriting standards established under paragraph (2) of this subsection when the Secretary determines, considering the totality of circumstances, that the veteran is a satisfactory credit risk.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) A loan may not be guaranteed under subsection (a)(12) unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the development, project, or structure of the cooperative housing corporation complies with such criteria as the Secretary prescribes in regulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the dwelling unit that the purchase of stock or membership in the development, project, or structure of the cooperative housing corporation entitles the purchaser to occupy is a single family residential unit.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In this subsection, the term &ldquo;cooperative housing corporation&rdquo; has the meaning given such term in section 216(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) When applying the term &ldquo;value of the property&rdquo; to a loan guaranteed under subsection (a)(12), such term means the appraised value of the stock or membership entitling the purchaser to the permanent occupancy of the dwelling unit in the development, project, or structure of the cooperative housing corporation.</p>
