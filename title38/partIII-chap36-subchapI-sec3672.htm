<p class="statutory-body">(a) An eligible person or veteran shall receive the benefits of this chapter and chapters 34 and 35 of this title while enrolled in a course of education offered by an educational institution only if (1) such course is approved as provided in this chapter and chapters 34 and 35 of this title by the State approving agency for the State where such educational institution is located, or by the Secretary, or (2) such course is approved (A) for the enrollment of the particular individual under the provisions of section 3536 of this title or (B) for special restorative training under subchapter V of chapter 35 of this title.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The period of a program of apprenticeship may be determined based upon a specific period of time (commonly referred to as a &ldquo;time-based program&rdquo;), based upon the demonstration of successful mastery of skills (commonly referred to as a &ldquo;competency-based program&rdquo;), or based upon a combination thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In the case of a competency-based program of apprenticeship, State approving agencies shall determine the period for which payment may be made for such a program under chapters 30 and 35 of this title and chapter 1606 of title 10.

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The sponsor of a competency-based program of apprenticeship shall provide notice to <!-- PDFPage:462 -->the State approving agency involved of any such standards that may apply to the program and the proposed approximate period of training under the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The sponsor of a competency-based program of apprenticeship shall notify the Secretary upon the successful completion of a program of apprenticeship by an individual under chapter 30 or 35 of this title, or chapter 1606 of title 10, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary and State approving agencies shall actively promote the development of apprenticeship and on the job training programs for the purposes of sections 3677 and 3687 of this title and shall utilize the services of disabled veterans&rsquo; outreach program specialists under section 4103A of this title to promote the development of such programs. The Secretary of Labor shall provide assistance and services to the Secretary, and to State approving agencies, to increase the use of apprenticeships.</p>
