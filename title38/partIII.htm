<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In any case in which the Secretary determines that a veteran has been prevented from participating in a vocational rehabilitation program under this chapter within the period of eligibility prescribed in subsection (a) of this section because a medical condition of such veteran made it infeasible for such veteran to participate in such a program, the twelve-year period of eligibility shall not run during the period of time that such veteran was so prevented from participating in such a program, and such period of eligibility shall again begin to run on the first day following such veteran's recovery from such condition on which it is reasonably feasible, as determined under regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, for such veteran to participate in such a program.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such veteran had not met the requirement of a discharge or release from active military, naval, or air service under conditions other than dishonorable before (i) the nature of such discharge or release was changed by appropriate authority, or (ii) the Secretary determined, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, that such discharge or release was under conditions other than dishonorable, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such veteran's discharge or dismissal was, under section 5303 of this title, a bar to benefits under this title before the Secretary made a determination that such discharge or dismissal is not a bar to such benefits,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">the twelve-year period of eligibility shall not run during the period of time that such veteran was so prevented from participating in such a program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any case in which the Secretary determines that a veteran has been prevented from participating in a vocational rehabilitation program under this chapter within the period of eligibility prescribed in subsection (a) of this section because such veteran had not established the existence of a service-connected disability described in section 3102(1)(A)(i) of this title, the twelve-year period of eligibility shall not run during the period such veteran was so prevented from participating in such a program.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:300 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) In any case in which the Secretary determines that a veteran is in need of services to overcome a serious employment handicap, such veteran may be afforded a vocational rehabilitation program after the expiration of the period of eligibility otherwise applicable to such veteran if the Secretary also determines, on the basis of such veteran's particular employment handicap and need for such services, that an extension of the applicable period of eligibility is necessary for such veteran and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that such veteran had not previously been rehabilitated to the point of employability;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the period of a vocational rehabilitation program for a veteran under this chapter following a determination of the current reasonable feasibility of achieving a vocational goal may not exceed forty-eight months, except that the counseling and placement and postplacement services described in section 3104(a)(2) and (5) of this title may be provided for an additional period not to exceed eighteen months in any case in which the Secretary determines the provision of such counseling and services to be necessary to accomplish the purposes of a rehabilitation program in the individual case.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that such veteran had previously been rehabilitated to the point of employability but (A) such veteran's need for further vocational rehabilitation has arisen out of a worsening of such veteran's service-connected disability that precludes such veteran from performing the duties of the occupation for which such veteran had been so rehabilitated, or (B) the occupation for which such veteran had been so rehabilitated is not suitable in view of such veteran's employment handicap and capabilities; or</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary shall provide any veteran who has a service-connected disability described in clause (i) or (ii) of section 3102(1)(A) of this title and who applies for benefits under this chapter with an initial evaluation consisting of such services described in section 3104(a)(1) of this title as are necessary (1) to determine whether such veteran is entitled to and eligible for benefits under this chapter, and (2) in the case of a veteran who is determined to be entitled to and eligible for such benefits, to determine&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) whether such veteran has a serious employment handicap, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) whether the achievement of a vocational goal currently is reasonably feasible for such veteran if it is reasonably feasible to make such determination without extended evaluation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In any case in which the Secretary has determined that a veteran has a serious employment handicap and that the achievement of a vocational goal currently is reasonably feasible for such veteran, such veteran shall be provided counseling in accordance with an individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation developed under section 3107(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In any case in which the Secretary has determined that a veteran has a serious employment handicap but the Secretary is unable to determine, in an initial evaluation pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, whether or not the achievement of a vocational goal currently is reasonably feasible, such veteran shall be provided with extended evaluation consisting of the services described in section 3104(a)(1) of this title, such services under this chapter as the Secretary determines necessary to improve such veteran's potential for participation in a program of services designed to achieve a vocational goal and enable such veteran to achieve maximum independence in daily living, and assistance as authorized by section 3108 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary shall in all cases determine as expeditiously as possible whether the achievement of a vocational goal by a veteran currently is reasonably feasible. In the case of a veteran provided extended evaluation under subsection (c) of this section (including any periods of extensions under section 3105(a) of this title), <!-- PDFPage:303 -->the Secretary shall make such determination not later than the end of such extended evaluation or period of extension, as the case may be. In determining whether the achievement of a vocational goal currently is reasonably feasible, the Secretary shall resolve any reasonable doubt in favor of determining that such achievement currently is reasonably feasible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) In connection with each period of extended evaluation of a veteran and each rehabilitation program for a veteran who is determined to have a serious employment handicap, the Secretary shall assign a Department of Veterans Affairs employee to be responsible for the management and followup of the provision of all services (including appropriate coordination of employment assistance under section 3117 of this title) and assistance under this chapter to such veteran.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), and subject to paragraph (4), of this subsection, educational assistance benefits shall not be afforded an eligible veteran under this chapter more than 10 years after the date of such veteran's last discharge or release from active duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If any eligible veteran was prevented from initiating or completing such veteran's chosen program of education during the delimiting period determined under paragraph (1) of this subsection because of a physical or mental disability which was not the result of such veteran's own willful misconduct, such veteran shall, upon application made in accordance with subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, be granted an extension of the applicable delimiting period for such length of time as the Secretary determines, from the evidence, that such veteran was so prevented from initiating or completing such program of education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An extension of the delimiting period applicable to an eligible veteran may be granted under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph by reason of the veteran's mental or physical disability only if the veteran submits an application for such extension to the Secretary within one year after (i) the last date of the delimiting period otherwise applicable to the veteran under paragraph (1) of this subsection, or (ii) the termination date of the period of the veteran's mental or physical disability, whichever is later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) When an extension of the applicable delimiting period is granted an eligible veteran under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the delimiting period with respect to such veteran shall again begin to run on the first day after such veteran's recovery from such disability on which it is reasonably feasible, as determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, for such veteran to initiate or resume pursuit of a program of education with educational assistance under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, a veteran's last discharge or release from active duty shall not include any discharge or release from a period of active duty of less than 90 days of continuous service unless the individual involved is discharged or released for a service-connected disability, for a medical condition which preexisted such service and which the Secretary determines is not service connected, for hardship, or as a result of a reduction in force as described in section 3011(a)(1)(A)(ii)(III) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In the event that an eligible veteran has not utilized any or all of such veteran's entitlement by the end of the delimiting period applicable to the veteran under subsection (a) of this section and at the end of one year thereafter has not filed a claim for utilizing such entitlement, such eligible veteran is automatically disenrolled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Any contributions which were made by a veteran disenrolled under paragraph (1) of this subsection and remain in the fund shall be refunded to the veteran after notice of disenrollment is transmitted to the veteran and the veteran applies for such refund.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:321 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) If no application for refund of contributions under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph is received from a disenrolled veteran within one year after the date the notice referred to in such subparagraph is transmitted to the veteran, it shall be presumed, for the purposes of section 1322(a) of title 31, that the veteran's whereabouts is unknown and the funds shall be transferred as provided in such section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Subject to paragraph (4) of this subsection, no educational assistance shall be afforded an eligible veteran under this chapter be<!-- PDFPage:328 -->yond the date 10 years after the veteran's last discharge or release from active duty after January 31, 1955; except that, in the case of any eligible veteran who was prevented from initiating or completing such veteran's chosen program of education within such time period because of a physical or mental disability which was not the result of such veteran's own willful misconduct, such veteran shall, upon application made within one year after (A) the last date of the delimiting period otherwise applicable under this section, (B) the termination of the period of such mental or physical disability, or (C) October 1, 1980, whichever is the latest, be granted an extension of the applicable delimiting period for such length of time as the Secretary determines, from the evidence, that such veteran was so prevented from initiating or completing such program of education. When an extension of the applicable delimiting period is granted a veteran under the preceding sentence, the delimiting period with respect to such veteran will again begin running on the first day following such veteran's recovery from such disability on which it is reasonably feasible, as determined in accordance with regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, for such veteran to initiate or resume pursuit of a program of education with educational assistance under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, any veteran shall be permitted to use any of such veteran's unused entitlement under section 3461 of this title for the purposes of eligibility for an education loan, pursuant to the provisions of subchapter III of chapter 36 of this title, after the delimiting date otherwise applicable to such veteran under such paragraph (1), if such veteran was pursuing an approved program of education on a full-time basis at the time of the expiration of such veteran's eligibility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or chapter 36 of this title, any veteran whose delimiting period is extended under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph may continue to use any unused loan entitlement under this paragraph as long as the veteran continues to be enrolled on a full-time basis in pursuit of the approved program of education in which such veteran was enrolled at the time of expiration of such veteran's eligibility (i) until such entitlement is exhausted, (ii) until the expiration of two years after November 23, 1977, or the date of the expiration of the delimiting date otherwise applicable to such veteran under paragraph (1) of this subsection, whichever is later, or (iii) until such veteran has completed the approved program of education in which such veteran was enrolled at the end of the delimiting period referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, whichever occurs first.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Subject to subparagraph (C) of this paragraph and notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, an eligible veteran who served on active duty during the Vietnam era shall be permitted to use any of such veteran's unused entitlement under section 3461 of this title for the purpose of pursuing&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) Educational assistance shall be provided a veteran for pursuit of a program or course described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph using eligibility provided by this paragraph unless the Secretary determines, based on an examination of the veteran's employment and training history, that the veteran is not in need of such a program or course in order to obtain a reasonably stable employment situation consistent with the veteran's abilities and aptitudes. Any such determination shall be made in accordance with regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Educational assistance provided a veteran for pursuit of a program described in clause (iii) of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph using eligibility provided by this paragraph shall be provided at the rate determined under section 3491(b)(2) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Educational assistance may not be provided by virtue of this paragraph after December 31, 1984.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, a veteran's last discharge or release from active duty shall not include any discharge or release from a period of active duty of less than 90 days of continuous service unless the individual involved is discharged or released for a service-connected disability, for a medical condition which preexisted such service and which the Secretary determines is not service connected, for hardship, or as a result of a reduction in force as described in section 3011(a)(1)(A)(ii)(III) of this title.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Correction of Discharge</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In the case of any eligible veteran who has been prevented, as determined by the Secretary, from completing a program of education under this chapter within the period prescribed by subsection (a), because the veteran had not met the nature of discharge requirements of this chapter before a change, correction, or modification of a discharge or dismissal made pursuant to section 1553 of title 10, the correction of the military records of the proper service department under section 1552 of title 10, or other corrective action by competent authority, then the 10-year delimiting period shall run from the date the veteran's discharge or dismissal was changed, corrected, or modified.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Savings Clause</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In the case of any eligible veteran who was discharged or released from active duty before June 1, 1966, the 10-year delimiting period shall run from such date, if it is later than the date which otherwise would be applicable. In the case of any eligible veteran who was discharged or released from active duty before August 31, 1967, <!-- PDFPage:329 -->and who pursues a course of farm cooperative training, apprenticeship or other training on the job, the 10-year delimiting period shall run from August 31, 1967, if it is later than the date which would otherwise be applicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In the case of any veteran (1) who served on or after January 31, 1955, (2) who became eligible for educational assistance under the provisions of this chapter or chapter 36 of this title, and (3) who, subsequent to the veteran's last discharge or release from active duty, was captured and held as a prisoner of war by a foreign government or power, there shall be excluded, in computing the veteran's 10-year period of eligibility for educational assistance, any period during which the veteran was so detained and any period immediately following the veteran's release from such detention during which the veteran was hospitalized at a military, civilian, or Department of Veterans Affairs medical facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) No educational assistance shall be afforded any eligible veteran under this chapter or chapter 36 of this title after December 31, 1989.</p>

In carrying out this section, the Secretary, wherever feasible, shall give priority to veterans with disabilities rated at 30 percent or more for purposes of chapter 11 of this title. In the event an individual ceases to be at least a three-quarter-time student before completing such agreement, the individual may, with the approval of the Secretary, be permitted to complete such agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary shall determine the number of individuals whose services the Department of Veterans Affairs can effectively utilize and the types of services that such individuals may be required to perform, on the basis of a survey, which the Secretary shall conduct annually, of each Department of Veterans Affairs regional office in order to determine the numbers of individuals whose services can effectively be utilized during an enrollment period in each geographical area where Department of Veterans Affairs activities are conducted, and shall determine which individuals shall be offered agreements under this section in accordance with regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, including as criteria (1) the need of the individual to augment the veteran's educational assistance or subsistence allowance; (2) the availability to the individual of transportation to the place where the individual's services are to be performed; (3) the motivation of the individual; and (4) in the case of a disabled veteran pursuing a course of vocational rehabilitation under chapter 31 of this title, the compatibility of the work assignment to the veteran's physical condition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Secretary may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, enter into an agreement with an individual under this section, or a modification of such an agreement, whereby the individual agrees to perform services of the kind described in clauses (A) through (E) of subsection (a)(1) of this section and agrees that the Secretary shall, in lieu of paying the work-study allowance payable for such services, as provided in subsection (a) of this section, deduct the amount of the allowance from the amount which the individual has been determined to be indebted to the United States by virtue of such individual's participation in a benefits program under this chapter, chapter 30, 31, 32, 35, or 36 (other than an education loan under subchapter III) of this title, or chapter 106 of title 10 (other than an indebtedness arising from a refund penalty imposed under section 2135&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3485_1_target" name="3485_1">1</a></sup> of such title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the provisions of this section (other than those provisions which are determined by the Secretary to be inapplicable to an agreement under this subsection) shall apply to any agreement authorized under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress hereby declares that the educational program established by this chapter is for the purpose of providing opportunities for <!-- PDFPage:344 -->education to children whose education would otherwise be impeded or interrupted by reason of the disability or death of a parent from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the Armed Forces after the beginning of the Spanish-American War, and for the purpose of aiding such children in attaining the educational status which they might normally have aspired to and obtained but for the disability or death of such parent. The Congress further declares that the educational program extended to the surviving spouses of veterans who died of service-connected disabilities and to spouses of veterans with a service-connected total disability permanent in nature is for the purpose of assisting them in preparing to support themselves and their families at a standard of living level which the veteran, but for the veteran's death or service disability, could have expected to provide for the veteran's family.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Any State approving agency may approve a program of training on the job (other than a program of apprenticeship) only when it finds that the job which is the objective of the training is one in which progression and appointment to the next higher classification are based upon skills learned through organized and supervised training on the job and not on such factors as length of service and normal turnover, and that the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section are met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The training establishment offering training which is desired to be approved for the purposes of this chapter must submit to the appropriate State approving agency a written application for approval which, in addition to furnishing such information as is required by the State approving agency, contains a certification that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the wages to be paid the eligible veteran or person (A) upon entrance into training, are not less than wages paid nonveterans in the same training position and are at least 50 per centum of the wages paid for the job for which the veteran or person is to be trained, and (B) such wages will be increased in regular periodic increments until, not later than the last full month of the training period, they will be at least 85 per centum of the wages paid for the job for which such eligible veteran or person is being trained; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there is reasonable certainty that the job for which the eligible veteran or person is to be trained will be available to the veteran or person at the end of the training period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) As a condition for approving a program of training on the job (other than a program of apprenticeship) the State approving agency must find upon investigation that the following criteria are met:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The training content of the course is adequate to qualify the eligible veteran or person for appointment to the job for which the veteran or person is to be trained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The job customarily requires full-time training for a period of not less than six months and not more than two years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The length of the training period is not longer than that customarily required by the training establishments in the community to provide an eligible veteran or person with the required skills, arrange for the acquiring of job knowledge, technical information, and other facts which the eligible veteran or person will need to learn in order to become competent on the job for which the veteran or person is being trained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Provision is made for related instruction for the individual eligible veteran or person who may need it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) There is in the training establishment adequate space, equipment, instructional material, and instructor personnel to provide satisfactory training on the job.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Adequate records are kept to show the progress made by each eligible veteran or person toward such veteran's or person's job objective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) No course of training will be considered bona fide if given to an eligible veteran or person who is already qualified by training and experience for the job.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) A signed copy of the training agreement for each eligible veteran or person, including the training program and wage scale as approved by the State approving agency, is provided to the veteran or person and to the Secretary and the State approving agency by the employer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) That the course meets such other criteria as may be established by the State approving agency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of the Secretary's determination whether any veteran or person is eligible for an advance payment under this section, the information submitted by the institution, the veteran or person, shall establish such veteran's or person's eligibility unless there is evidence in such veteran's or person's file in the processing office establishing that the veteran or person is not eligible for such advance payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The advance payment authorized by paragraph (2) of this subsection shall, in the case of an eligible veteran or eligible person, be (A) drawn in favor of the veteran or person; (B) mailed to the educational institution listed on the application form for temporary care and delivery to the veteran or person by such institution; and (C) delivered to the veteran or person upon such veteran's or person's registration at such institution, but in no event shall such delivery be made earlier than thirty days before the program of education is to commence.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), if an eligible veteran or eligible person fails to enroll in or pursue a course for which an educational assistance or subsistence allowance advance payment is made, the amount of such payment and any amount of subsequent payments which, in whole or in part, are due to erroneous information required to be furnished under subsection (d)(2) of this section, shall become an overpayment and shall constitute a liability of such veteran or person to the United States and may be recovered, unless waived pursuant to section 5302 of this title, from any benefit otherwise due such veteran or person under any law administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs or may be recovered in the same manner as any other debt due the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the recovery of an overpayment of an educational allowance or subsistence allowance advance payment to an eligible veteran or eligible person who fails to enroll in or pursue a course of education for which the payment is made if such failure is due to the death of the veteran or person.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Payments for Less Than Half-Time Training</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Payment of educational assistance allowance in the case of any eligible veteran or eligible person pursuing a program of education on less than a half-time basis shall be made in an amount computed for the entire quarter, semester, or term not later than the last day of the month immediately following the month in which certification is received from the educational institution that such veteran or person has enrolled in and is pursuing a program at such institution. Such lump sum payment shall be computed at the rate provided in section 3482(b) or 3532(a)(2) of this title, as applicable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Secretary may, pursuant to regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, determine and define enrollment in, pursuit of, and attendance at, any program of education or training or course by an eligible veteran or eligible person for any period for which the veteran or person receives an educational assistance or subsistence allowance under this chapter for pursuing such program or course. Subject to such reports and proof as the Secretary may require to show an eligible veteran's or eligible person's enrollment in and satisfactory pursuit of such person's program, the Secretary may withhold payment of benefits to such eligible veteran or eligible person until the required proof is received and the amount of the payment is appropriately adjusted. The Secretary may accept such veteran's or person's monthly certification of enrollment in and satisfactory pursuit of such veteran's or person's program as sufficient proof of the certified matters.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the veteran or eligible person and the educational institution offering a course in which such veteran or eligible person is enrolled under chapter 31, 34,,<sup><a href="#3684_1_target" name="3684_1">1</a></sup> 35, or 36 of this title shall, without delay, report to the Secretary, in the form prescribed by the Secretary, such enrollment and any interruption or termination of the education of each such veteran or eligible person. The date of such interruption or termination will be the last date of pursuit, or, in the case of correspondence training, the last date a lesson was serviced by a school.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the case of a program of independent study pursued on less than a half-time basis in an educational institution, the Secretary may approve a delay by the educational institution in reporting the enrollment or reenrollment of an eligible veteran or eligible person until the end of the term, quarter, or semester if the educational institution requests the delay and the Secretary determines that it is not feasible for the educational institution to monitor interruption or termination of the veteran's or eligible person's pursuit of such program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An educational institution which, pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, is delaying the reporting of the enrollment or reenrollment of a veteran shall provide the veteran with notice of the delay at the time that the veteran enrolls or reenrolls.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, an educational institution offering courses on a term, quarter, or semester basis may certify the enrollment of a veteran who is not on active duty, or of an eligible person, in such courses for more than one term, quarter, or semester at a time, but not for a period extending beyond the end of a school year (including the summer enrollment period).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to any term, quarter, or semester for which the veteran or eligible person is enrolled on a less than half-time basis and shall not be construed as restricting the Secretary from requiring that an educational institution, in reporting an enrollment for more than one term, quarter, or semester, specify the dates of any intervals within or between any such terms, quarters, or semesters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary, prior to making payment of a reporting fee to an educational institution, as provided for in subsection (c) of this section, shall require such institution to certify that it has exercised reasonable diligence in determining whether such institution or any course offered by such institution approved for the enrollment of veterans or eligible persons meets <!-- PDFPage:381 -->all of the applicable requirements of chapters 31, 34, 35, and 36 of this title and that it will, without delay, report any failure to meet any such requirement to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary may pay to any educational institution, or to any joint apprenticeship training committee acting as a training establishment, furnishing education or training under either this chapter or chapter 31, 34, or 35 of this title, a reporting fee which will be in lieu of any other compensation or reimbursement for reports or certifications which such educational institution or joint apprenticeship training committee is required to submit to the Secretary by law or regulation. Such reporting fee shall be computed for each calendar year by multiplying $7 by the number of eligible veterans or eligible persons enrolled under this chapter or chapter 31, 34, or 35 of this title, or $11 in the case of those eligible veterans and eligible persons whose educational assistance checks are directed in care of each institution for temporary custody and delivery and are delivered at the time of registration as provided under section 3680(d)(4) of this title, on October 31 of that year; except that the Secretary may, where it is established by such educational institution or joint apprenticeship training committee that eligible veteran plus eligible person enrollment on such date varies more than 15 percent from the peak eligible veteran enrollment plus eligible person enrollment in such educational institution or joint apprenticeship training committee during such calendar year, establish such other date as representative of the peak enrollment as may be justified for such educational institution or joint apprenticeship training committee. The reporting fee shall be paid to such educational institution or joint apprenticeship training committee as soon as feasible after the end of the calendar year for which it is applicable. No reporting fee payable to an educational institution under this subsection shall be subject to offset by the Secretary against any liability of such institution for any overpayment for which such institution may be administratively determined to be liable under section 3685 of this title unless such liability is not contested by such institution or has been upheld by a final decree of a court of appropriate jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Whenever the Secretary finds that an overpayment has been made to a veteran or eligible person as the result of (1) the willful or negligent failure of an educational institution to report, as required under this chapter or chapter 34 or 35 of this title, to the Department of Veterans Affairs excessive absences from a course, or discontinuance or interruption of a course by the veteran or eligible person, or (2) the willful or negligent false certification by an educational institution, the amount of such overpayment shall constitute a liability of the educational institution to the United States.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Each eligible veteran (as defined in section 3452(a)(1) and (2) of this title) and each eligible spouse or surviving spouse (as defined in section 3501(a)(1)(B), (C), or (D) of this title) who enters into an enrollment agreement to pursue a program of education exclusively by correspondence shall be paid an educational assistance allowance computed at the rate of 55 percent of the established charge which the institution requires nonveterans to pay for the course or courses pursued by the eligible veteran or spouse or surviving spouse. The term &ldquo;established charge&rdquo; as used herein means the charge for the course or courses determined on the basis of the lowest extended time payment plan offered by the institution and approved by the appropriate State approving agency or the actual cost to the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse, whichever is the lesser. Such allowance shall be paid quarterly on a pro rata basis for the lessons completed by the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse and serviced by the institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The period of entitlement of any veteran or spouse or surviving spouse who is pursuing any program of education exclusively by correspondence shall be charged with one month for each $376 which is paid to the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse as an educational assistance allowance for such course.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law unless enacted in express limitation of this paragraph, funds in the Department of Veterans Affairs readjustment benefits account shall be available for payments under paragraph (1) of this subsection for pursuit of a program of education exclusively by correspondence in which the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse enrolls after September 30, 1981.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The enrollment agreement shall fully disclose the obligation of both the institution and the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse and shall prominently display the provisions for affirmance, termination, refunds, and the conditions under which payment of the allowance is made by the Secretary to the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse. A copy of the enrollment agreement shall be furnished to each such veteran or spouse or surviving spouse at the time such veteran or spouse or surviving spouse signs such agreement. No such agreement shall be effective unless such veteran or spouse or surviving spouse shall, after the expiration of ten days after the enrollment agreement is signed, have signed and submitted to the Secretary a written statement, with a signed copy to the institution, specifically affirming the enrollment agreement. In the event the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse at any time notifies the institution of such veteran's or spouse's intention not to affirm the agreement in accordance with the preceding sentence, the institution, without imposing any penalty or charging any fee shall promptly make a full refund of all amounts paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In the event a veteran or spouse or surviving spouse elects to terminate such veteran's or spouse's enrollment under an affirmed enrollment agreement, the institution may charge the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse a registration or similar fee not in excess of 10 percent of the tuition for the course, or $50, whichever is less. Where the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse elects to terminate the agreement after completion of one or more but less than 25 percent of the total number of lessons comprising the course, the institution may retain such registration or similar fee plus 25 percent of the tuition for the course. Where the veteran or spouse or surviving spouse elects to terminate the agreement after completion of 25 percent but less than 50 percent of the lessons comprising the course, the institution may retain the full registration or similar fee plus 50 percent of the course tuition. If 50 percent or more of the lessons are completed, no refund of tuition is required.</p>

<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Overcharges by Educational Institutions</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) If the Secretary finds that an educational institution has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) charged or received from any eligible veteran or eligible person pursuing a program of education under this chapter or chapter 34 or 35 of this title any amount for any course in excess of the charges for tuition and fees which such institution requires similarly circumstanced nonveterans not receiving assistance under such chapters who are enrolled in the same course to pay, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) instituted, after October 24, 1972, a policy or practice with respect to the payment of tuition, fees, or other charges in the case of eligible veterans and the Secretary finds that the effect of such policy or practice substantially denies to veterans the benefits of the advance allowances under such section,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Secretary may disapprove such educational institution for the enrollment of any eligible <!-- PDFPage:390 -->veteran or eligible person not already enrolled therein under this chapter or chapter 31, 34, or 35 of this title.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Discontinuance of Allowances</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary may discontinue the educational assistance allowance of any eligible veteran or eligible person if the Secretary finds that the program of education or any course in which the veteran or person is enrolled fails to meet any of the requirements of this chapter or chapter 34 or 35 of this title, or if the Secretary finds that the educational institution offering such program or course has violated any provision of this chapter or chapter 34 or 35 of this title, or fails to meet any of the requirements of such chapters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, any action by the Secretary under paragraph (1) of this subsection to discontinue (including to suspend) assistance provided to any eligible veteran or eligible person under this chapter or chapter 31, 32, 34, or 35 of this title shall be based upon evidence that the veteran or eligible person is not or was not entitled to such assistance. Whenever the Secretary so discontinues any such assistance, the Secretary shall concurrently provide written notice to such veteran or person of such discontinuance and that such veteran or person is entitled thereafter to a statement of the reasons for such action and an opportunity to be heard thereon.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary may suspend educational assistance to eligible veterans and eligible persons already enrolled, and may disapprove the enrollment or reenrollment of any eligible veteran or eligible person, in any course as to which the Secretary has evidence showing a substantial pattern of eligible veterans or eligible persons, or both, who are receiving such assistance by virtue of their enrollment in such course but who are not entitled to such assistance because (i) the course approval requirements of this chapter are not being met, or (ii) the educational institution offering such course has violated one or more of the recordkeeping or reporting requirements of this chapter or chapter 30, 32, 34, or 35 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Action may be taken under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph only after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Secretary provides to the State approving agency concerned and the educational institution concerned written notice of any such failure to meet such approval requirements and any such violation of such recordkeeping or reporting requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) such institution refuses to take corrective action or does not within 60 days after such notice (or within such longer period as the Secretary determines is reasonable and appropriate) take corrective action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the Secretary, not less than 30 days before taking action under such subparagraph, provides to each eligible veteran and eligible person already enrolled in such course written notice of the Secretary's intent to take such action (and the reasons therefor) unless such corrective action is taken within such 60 days (or within such longer period as the Secretary has determined is reasonable and appropriate), and of the date on which the Secretary intends to take action under such subparagraph.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">Examination of Records</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the records and accounts of educational institutions pertaining to eligible veterans or eligible persons who received educational assistance under this chapter or chapter 31, 32, 34, or 35 of this title, as well as the records of other students which the Secretary determines necessary to ascertain institutional compliance with the requirements of such chapters, shall be available for examination by duly authorized representatives of the Government.</p>
<h3 class="analysis-subhead">False or Misleading Statements</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Whenever the Secretary finds that an educational institution has willfully submitted a false or misleading claim, or that a veteran or person, with the complicity of an educational institution, has submitted such a claim, the Secretary shall make a complete report of the facts of the case to the appropriate State approving agency and, where deemed advisable, to the Attorney General of the United States for appropriate action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, each eligible veteran shall be entitled to a loan under this subchapter (if the program of education is pursued in a State) in an amount determined under, and subject to the conditions specified in, subsection (b)(1) of this section if the veteran satisfies the requirements set forth in subsection (c) of this section and the criteria established under subsection (g) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except in the case of a veteran to whom section 3462(a)(2) of this title is applicable, no loan may be made under this subchapter after September 30, 1981.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, the amount of the loan to which an eligible veteran shall be entitled under this subchapter for any academic year shall be equal to the amount needed by such veteran to pursue a program of education at the institution at which the veteran is enrolled, as determined under paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The amount needed by a veteran to pursue a program of education at an institution for any academic year shall be determined by subtracting (i) the total amount of financial resources (as defined in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph) available to the veteran which may be reasonably expected to be expended by such veteran for educational purposes in any year from (ii) the actual cost of attendance (as defined in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph) at the institution in which such veteran is enrolled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The term &ldquo;total amount of financial resources&rdquo; of any veteran for any year means the total of the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The amount of financial assistance received by the veteran under the provisions of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Educational assistance received by the veteran under this title other than under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) Financial assistance received by the veteran under any scholarship or grant program other than those specified in clauses (iii) and (iv).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The term &ldquo;actual cost of attendance&rdquo; means, subject to such regulations as the Secretary may provide, the actual per-student charges for tuition, fees, room and board (or expenses related to reasonable commuting), books, and an allowance for such other expenses as the Secretary determines by regulation to be reasonably related to attendance at the institution at which the veteran is enrolled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The aggregate of the amounts any veteran may borrow under this subchapter may not exceed $376 multiplied by the number of months such veteran is entitled to receive educational assistance under section 3461 of this title, but not in excess of $2,500 in any one regular academic year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) An eligible veteran shall be entitled to a loan under this subchapter if such veteran&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is in attendance at an educational institution on at least a half-time basis and (A) is enrolled in a course leading to a standard college degree, or (B) is enrolled in a course, the completion of which requires six months or longer, leading to an identified and predetermined professional or vocational objective, except that the Secretary may waive the requirements of subclause (B) of this clause, in whole or in part, if the Secretary determines, pursuant to regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, it to be in the interest of the eligible veteran and the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) enters into an agreement with the Secretary meeting the requirements of subsection (d) of this section; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:397 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) satisfies any criteria established under subsection (g) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">No loan shall be made under this subchapter to an eligible veteran pursuing a program of correspondence, or apprenticeship or other on-job training.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Any agreement between the Secretary and a veteran under this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall include a note or other written obligation which provides for repayment to the Secretary of the principal amount of, and payment of interest on, the loan in installments (A) over a period beginning nine months after the date on which the borrower ceases to be at least a half-time student and ending ten years and nine months after such date, or (B) over such shorter period as the Secretary may have prescribed under subsection (g) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall include provision for acceleration of repayment of all or any part of the loan, without penalty, at the option of the borrower;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall provide that the loan shall bear interest, on the unpaid balance of the loan, at a rate prescribed by the Secretary, at the time the loan is contracted for which rate shall be comparable to the rate of interest charged students at such time on loans insured by the Secretary of Education under part B of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, but in no event shall the rate so prescribed by the Secretary exceed the rate charged students on such insured loans, and shall provide that no interest shall accrue prior to the beginning date of repayment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) shall provide that the loan shall be made without security and without endorsement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, whenever the Secretary determines that a default has occurred on any loan made under this subchapter, the Secretary shall declare an overpayment, and such overpayment shall be recovered from the veteran concerned in the same manner as any other debt due the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a veteran who has received a loan under this section dies or becomes permanently and totally disabled, then the Secretary shall discharge the veteran's liability on such loan by repaying the amount owed on such loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Payment of a loan made under this section shall be drawn in favor of the eligible veteran and mailed promptly to the educational institution in which such veteran is enrolled. Such institution shall deliver such payment to the eligible veteran as soon as practicable after receipt thereof. Upon delivery of such payment to the eligible veteran, such educational institution shall promptly submit to the Secretary a certification, on such form as the Secretary shall prescribe, of such delivery, and such delivery shall be deemed to be an advance payment under section 3680(d)(4) of this title for purposes of section 3684(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) The Secretary shall conduct, on a continuing basis, a review of the default experience with respect to loans made under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) To ensure that loans are made under this section on the basis of financial need directly related to the costs of education, the Secretary may, by regulation, establish (i) criteria for eligibility for such loans, in addition to the criteria and requirements prescribed by subsections (c) and (d) of this section, in order to limit eligibility for such loans to eligible veterans attending educational institutions with relatively high rates of tuition and fees, and (ii) criteria under which the Secretary may prescribe a repayment period for certain types of loans made under this section that is shorter than the repayment period otherwise applicable under subsection (d)(1)(A) of this section. Criteria established by the Secretary under clause (i) of the preceding sentence may include a minimum amount of tuition and fees that an eligible veteran may pay in order to be eligible for such a loan (except that any such criterion shall not apply with respect to a loan for which the veteran is eligible as a result of an extension of the period of eligibility of such veteran for loans under this section provided for by section 3462(a)(2) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In prescribing regulations under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall take into consideration information developed in the course of the review required by paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Regulations may be prescribed under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph only after opportunity has been afforded for public comment thereon.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) The property which secured the loan has been disposed of by the veteran or has <!-- PDFPage:403 -->been destroyed by fire or other natural hazard; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A veteran-transferee has agreed to assume the outstanding balance on the loan and consented to the use of the veteran-transferee's entitlement, to the extent that the entitlement of the veteran-transferor had been used originally, in place of the veteran-transferor's for the guaranteed, insured, or direct loan, and the veteran-transferee otherwise meets the requirements of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) The loan has been repaid in full; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the loan for which the veteran seeks to use entitlement under this chapter is secured by the same property which secured the loan referred to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>

The authority of the Secretary under this subsection to exclude an amount of guaranty or insurance housing loan entitlement previously used by a veteran may be exercised only once for that veteran under the authority of paragraph (4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) An honorable discharge shall be deemed to be a certificate of eligibility to apply for a guaranteed loan. Any veteran who does not have a discharge certificate, or who received a discharge other than honorable, may apply to the Secretary for a certificate of eligibility. Upon making a loan guaranteed or insured under this chapter, the lender shall forthwith transmit to the Secretary a report thereon in such detail as the Secretary may, from time to time, prescribe. Where the loan is guaranteed, the Secretary shall provide the lender with a loan guaranty certificate or other evidence of the guaranty. The Secretary shall also endorse on the veteran's discharge, or eligibility certificate, the amount and type of guaranty used, and the amount, if any, remaining. Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the assignment of any guaranteed loan or the security therefor.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary may at any time upon thirty days&rsquo; notice require housing loans to be made by any lender or class of lenders to be submitted to the Secretary for prior approval. No guaranty or insurance liability shall exist with respect to any such loan unless evidence of guaranty or insurance is issued by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Any housing loan at least 20 percent of which is guaranteed under this chapter may be made by any national bank or Federal savings and loan association, or by any bank, trust company, building and loan association, or insurance company, organized or authorized to do business in the District of Columbia. Any such loan may be so made without regard to the limitations and restrictions of any other law relating to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Any housing loan which might be guaranteed under the provisions of this chapter, when made or purchased by any financial institution subject to examination and supervision by any agency of the United States or of any State may, in lieu of such guaranty, be insured by the Secretary under an agreement whereby the Secretary will reimburse any such institution for losses incurred on such loan up to 15 per centum of the aggregate of loans so made or purchased by it.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Loans guaranteed or insured under this chapter shall be payable upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the parties thereto, subject to the provisions of this chapter and regulations of the Secretary issued pursuant to this chapter, and shall bear interest not in excess of such rate as the Secretary may from time to time find the loan market demands, except that in establishing the rate of interest that shall be applicable to such loans, the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development regarding the rate of interest applicable to home loans insured under section 203(b) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(b)). In establishing rates of interest under this paragraph for one or more of the purposes described in clauses (4) and (7) of section 3710(a) of this title, the Secretary may establish a rate or rates higher than the rate specified for other purposes under such section, but any such rate may not exceed such rate as the Secretary may from time to time find the loan market demands for loans for such purposes.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) to purchase a dwelling from a class of sellers which the Secretary determines are legally precluded under all circumstances from paying such a discount if the best interest of the veteran would be so served; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) to refinance indebtedness and purchase a manufactured-home lot pursuant to section 3710(a)(9)(B)(ii) or 3712(a)(1)(G) of this title, but only with respect to that portion of the loan used to refinance such indebtedness.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) In guaranteeing or insuring loans under this chapter, the Secretary may elect whether to require that such loans bear interest at a rate that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) agreed upon by the veteran and the mortgagee; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) established under paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary may, from time to time, change the election under this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any veteran, under a loan described in subparagraph (A)(i), may pay reasonable discount points in connection with the loan. Except in the case of a loan for the purpose specified in section 3710(a)(8), 3710(b)(7), or 3712(a)(1)(F) of this title, discount points may not be financed as part of the principal amount of a loan guaranteed or insured under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Not later than 10 days after an election under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall transmit to the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives a notification of the election, together with an explanation of the reasons therefor.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the initial principal amount of the loan may not exceed the reasonable value of the property as of the time the loan is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the principal amount of the loan thereafter (including the amount of all interest to be deferred and added to principal) may not at any time be scheduled to exceed the projected value of the property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For the purposes of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the projected value of the property shall be calculated by the Secretary by increasing the reasonable value of the property as of the time the loan is made at a rate not in excess of 2.5 percent per year, but in no event may the projected value of the property for the purposes of such subparagraph exceed 115 percent of such reasonable value. A loan made for a purpose other than the acquisition of a single-family dwelling unit may not be guaranteed under such subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any real estate housing loan (other than for repairs, alterations, or improvements) shall be secured by a first lien on the realty. In determining whether a loan for the purchase or construction of a home is so secured, the Secretary may disregard a superior lien created by a duly recorded covenant running with the realty in favor of a private entity to secure an obligation to such entity for the homeowner's share of the costs of the management, operation, or maintenance of property, services or programs within and for the benefit of the development or community in which the veteran's realty is located, if the Secretary determines that the interests of the veteran borrower and of the Government will not be prejudiced by the operation of such covenant. In respect to any such superior lien to be created after June 6, 1969, the Secretary's determination must have been made prior to the recordation of the covenant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, an individual who pays a fee under section 3729 of this title, or who is exempted under section 3729(c)(1) of this title from paying such fee, with respect to a housing loan guaranteed or insured under this chapter that is closed after December 31, 1989, shall have no liability to the Secretary with respect to the loan for any loss resulting from any default of such individual except in the case of fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith by such individual in obtaining the loan or in connection with the loan default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The exemption from liability provided by paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an individual from whom a fee is collected (or who is exempted from such fee) under section 3729(b) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a loan made for any purpose specified in section 3712 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The application for or obtaining of a loan made, insured, or guaranteed under this chapter shall not be subject to reporting requirements applicable to requests for, or receipts of, Federal contracts, grants, loans, loan guarantees, loan insurance, or cooperative agreements except to the extent that such requirements are provided for in, or by the Secretary pursuant to, this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) No loan for the purchase or construction of residential property shall be financed through the assistance of this chapter unless the property meets or exceeds minimum requirements for planning, construction, and general acceptability prescribed by the Secretary; however, this subsection shall not apply to a loan for the purchase of residential property on which construction is fully completed more than one year before such loan is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Subject to notice and opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary may refuse to appraise any dwelling or housing project owned, sponsored, or to be constructed by any person identified with housing previously sold to veterans under this chapter as to which substantial deficiencies have been discovered, or as to which there has been a failure or indicated inability to discharge contractual liabilities to veterans, or as to which it is ascertained that the type of contract of sale or the methods or practices pursued in relation to the marketing of such properties were unfair or unduly prejudicial to veteran purchasers. The Secretary may also refuse to appraise any dwelling or housing project owned, sponsored, or to be constructed by any person refused the benefits of participation <!-- PDFPage:410 -->under the National Housing Act pursuant to a determination of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, no loan for the purchase or construction of residential property shall be financed through the assistance of this chapter unless the veteran applicant, at the time that the veteran applies for the loan, and also at the time that the loan is closed, certifies in such form as the Secretary may require, that the veteran intends to occupy the property as the veteran's home. Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, no loan for the repair, alteration, or improvement of residential property shall be financed through the assistance of the provisions of this chapter unless the veteran applicant, at the time that the veteran applies to the lender for the loan, and also at the time that the loan is closed, certifies, in such form as may be required by the Secretary, that the veteran occupies the property as the veteran's home. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection, in the case of a loan automatically guaranteed under this chapter, the veteran shall be required to make the certification only at the time the loan is closed. For the purposes of this chapter the requirement that the veteran recipient of a guaranteed or direct home loan must occupy or intend to occupy the property as the veteran's home means that the veteran as of the date of the veteran's certification actually lives in the property personally as the veteran's residence or actually intends upon completion of the loan and acquisition of the dwelling unit to move into the property personally within a reasonable time and to utilize such property as the veteran's residence. Notwithstanding the foregoing requirements of this subsection, the provisions for certification by the veteran at the time the veteran applies for the loan and at the time the loan is closed shall be considered to be satisfied if the Secretary finds that (1) in the case of a loan for repair, alteration, or improvement the veteran in fact did occupy the property at such times, or (2) in the case of a loan for construction or purchase the veteran intended to occupy the property as the veteran's home at such times and the veteran did in fact so occupy it when, or within a reasonable time after, the loan was closed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which a veteran is in active duty status as a member of the Armed Forces and is unable to occupy a property because of such status, the occupancy requirements of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) paragraph (1) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) paragraphs (1) through (5) and paragraph (7) of section 3710(a) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) section 3712(a)(5)(A)(i) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) section 3712(e)(5) of this title;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be considered to be satisfied if the spouse of the veteran occupies the property as the spouse's home and the spouse makes the certification required by paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Subject to notice and opportunity for a hearing, whenever the Secretary finds with respect to guaranteed or insured loans that any lender or holder has failed to maintain adequate loan accounting records, or to demonstrate proper ability to service loans adequately or to exercise proper credit judgment or has willfully or negligently engaged in practices otherwise detrimental to the interest of veterans or of the Government, the Secretary may refuse either temporarily or permanently to guarantee or insure any loans made by such lender or holder and may bar such lender or holder from acquiring loans guaranteed or insured under this chapter; however, the Secretary shall not refuse to pay a guaranty or insurance claim on loans theretofore entered into in good faith between a veteran and such lender. The Secretary may also refuse either temporarily or permanently to guarantee or insure any loans made by a lender or holder refused the benefits of participation under the National Housing Act pursuant to a determination of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Any housing loan which is financed through the assistance of this chapter and to which section 3714 of this chapter applies shall include a provision that the loan is immediately due and payable upon transfer of the property securing such loan to any transferee unless the acceptability of the assumption of the loan is established pursuant to such section 3714.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) A loan for the purchase or construction of new residential property, the construction of which began after the energy efficiency standards under section 109 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 12709), as amended by section 101(c) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, take effect, may not be financed through the assistance of this chapter unless the new residential property is constructed in compliance with such standards.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A loan to a veteran may be guaranteed by the Secretary under this chapter for the purpose specified in clause (8) of subsection (a) of this section without regard to the amount of outstanding guaranty entitlement available for use by such veteran, and the amount of such veteran's guaranty entitlement shall not be charged as a result of any guaranty provided for such purpose.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purpose of determining whether a veteran meets the standards referred to in subsection (b)(3) of this section and section 3712(e)(2) of this title, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations which establish&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) credit underwriting standards to be used in evaluating loans to be guaranteed under this chapter; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Any lender making a loan under this chapter shall certify, in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe, that the lender has complied with the credit information and loan processing standards established under paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection, and that, to the best of the lender's knowledge and belief, the loan meets the underwriting standards established under paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any lender who knowingly and willfully makes a false certification under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty equal to two times the amount of the Secretary's loss on the loan involved or to another appropriate amount, not to exceed $10,000, whichever is greater. All determinations necessary to carry out this subparagraph shall be made by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Pursuant to regulations prescribed to carry out this paragraph, the Secretary may, in extraordinary situations, waive the application of the credit underwriting standards established under paragraph (2) of this subsection when the Secretary determines, considering the totality of circumstances, that the veteran is a satisfactory credit risk.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3711. Direct loans to veterans</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that housing credit for purposes specified in section 3710 or 3712 of this title is not and has not been generally available to veterans living in rural areas, or in small cities and towns not near large metropolitan areas. It is therefore the purpose of this section to provide housing credit for veterans living in such rural areas and such small cities and towns.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Whenever the Secretary finds that private capital is not generally available in any rural area or small city or town for the financing of loans guaranteed for purposes specified in section 3710 or 3712 of this title, the Secretary shall designate such rural area or small city or town as a &ldquo;housing credit shortage area&rdquo;. The Secretary shall, with respect to any such area, make, or enter into commitments to make, to any veteran eligible under this title, a loan for any or all of the purposes described in section 3710(a) or 3712 of this title (other than the refinancing of a loan under section 3710(a)(8) or 3712(a)(1)(F)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) No loan may be made under this section to a veteran unless the veteran shows to the satisfaction of the Secretary that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the veteran is unable to obtain from a private lender in such housing credit shortage area, at an interest rate not in excess of the rate authorized for guaranteed home loans or manufactured home loans, as appropriate, a loan for such purpose for which the veteran is qualified under section 3710 or 3712 of this title, as appropriate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the veteran is unable to obtain a loan for such purpose from the Secretary of Agriculture under title III of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1921 et seq.) or title V of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Loans made under this section shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary, not to exceed the rate authorized for guaranteed home loans, or manufactured home loans, as appropriate, and shall be subject to such requirements or limitations prescribed for loans guaranteed under this title as may be applicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except for any loan made under this chapter for the purposes described in section 3712 of this title, the original principal amount of any loan made under this section shall not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to $33,000 as the amount of guaranty to which the veteran is entitled under section 3710 of this title at the time the loan is made bears to $36,000; and the guaranty entitlement of any veteran who heretofore or hereafter has been granted a loan under this section shall be charged with an amount which bears the same ratio to $36,000 as the amount of the loan bears to $33,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The original principal amount of any loan made under this section for the purposes described in section 3712 of this title shall not exceed the amount that bears the same ratio to $33,000 as the amount of guaranty to which the veteran is entitled under such section at the time the loan is made bears to $20,000. The amount of the guaranty entitlement for purposes specified in section 3710 of this title of any veteran who is granted a loan under this section, or who before October 18, 1978, was granted a loan under this section, shall be charged with the amount that bears the same ratio to $20,000 as the amount of the loan bears to $33,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No veteran may obtain loans under this section aggregating more than $33,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Loans made under this section shall be repaid in monthly installments, except that in the case of any such loan made for any of the purposes described in paragraphs (2), (3), or (4) of section 3710(a) of this title, the Secretary may provide that such loan shall be repaid in quarterly, semiannual, or annual installments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) In connection with any loan under this section, the Secretary may make advances in cash to pay taxes and assessments on the real estate, to provide for repairs, alterations, and improvements, and to meet the incidental expenses of the transaction. The Secretary shall determine the expenses incident to origination of loans made under this section, which expenses, or a reasonable flat allowance in lieu thereof, shall be paid by the veteran in addition to the loan closing costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Secretary may sell, and shall offer for sale, to any person or entity approved for such purpose by the Secretary, any loan made under this section at a price which the Secretary determines to be reasonable under the conditions prevailing in the mortgage market when the agreement to sell the loan is made; and shall guarantee any loan thus sold subject to the same conditions, terms, and limitations which would be applicable were the loan guaranteed for purposes specified in section 3710 or 3712 of this title, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The Secretary may exempt dwellings constructed through assistance provided by this section from the minimum land planning and subdivision requirements prescribed pursuant to subsection (a) of section 3704 of this title, and with respect to such dwellings may prescribe special minimum land planning and subdivision requirements which shall be in keeping with the general housing facilities in the locality but shall require that such dwellings meet minimum requirements of structural soundness and general acceptability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) The Secretary is authorized, without regard to the provisions of subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section, to make or enter into a commitment to make a loan to any veteran to assist the veteran in acquiring a specially adapted housing unit authorized under chapter 21 of this title, if the veteran is determined to be eligible for the benefits of such chapter 21, and is eligible for loan guaranty benefits under this chapter.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:419 --><p class="statutory-body">(j)(1) If any builder or sponsor proposes to construct one or more dwellings in a housing credit shortage area, or in any area for a veteran who is determined to be eligible for assistance in acquiring a specially adapted housing unit under chapter 21 of this title, the Secretary may enter into commitment with such builder or sponsor, under which funds available for loans under this section will be reserved for a period not in excess of three months, or such longer period as the Secretary may authorize to meet the needs in any particular case, for the purpose of making loans to veterans to purchase such dwellings. Such commitment may not be assigned or transferred except with the written approval of the Secretary. The Secretary shall not enter into any such commitment unless such builder or sponsor pays a nonrefundable commitment fee to the Secretary in an amount determined by the Secretary, not to exceed 2 percent of the funds reserved for such builder or sponsor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever the Secretary finds that a dwelling with respect to which funds are being reserved under this subsection has been sold, or contracted to be sold, to a veteran eligible for a direct loan under this section, the Secretary shall enter into a commitment to make the veteran a loan for the purchase of such dwelling. With respect to any loan made to an eligible veteran under this subsection, the Secretary may make advances during the construction of the dwelling, up to a maximum in advances of (A) the cost of the land plus (B) 80 percent of the value of the construction in place.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) Without regard to any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary may take or cause to be taken such action as in the Secretary's judgment may be necessary or appropriate for or in connection with the custody, management, protection, and realization or sale of investments under this section, may determine the Secretary's necessary expenses and expenditures, and the manner in which the same shall be incurred, allowed and paid, may make such rules, regulations, and orders as the Secretary may deem necessary or appropriate for carrying out the Secretary's functions under this section and section 3723 of this title and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, may employ, utilize, compensate, and, to the extent not inconsistent with the Secretary's basic responsibilities under this chapter, delegate any of the Secretary's functions under this section and section 3723 of this title to such persons and such corporate or other agencies, including agencies of the United States, as the Secretary may designate.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3713. Release from liability under guaranty</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Whenever any veteran disposes of residential property securing a guaranteed, insured, or direct housing loan obtained by the veteran, the Secretary, upon application made by such veteran and by the transferee incident to such disposal, shall issue to such veteran in connection with such disposal a release relieving the veteran of all further liability to the Secretary on account of such loan (including liability for any loss resulting from any default of the transferee or any subsequent purchaser of such property) if the Secretary has determined, after such investigation as the Secretary may deem appropriate, that (1) the loan is current, and (2) the purchaser of such property from such veteran (A) is obligated by contract to purchase such property and to assume full liability for the repayment of the balance of the loan remaining unpaid, and has assumed by contract all of the obligations of the veteran under the terms of the instruments creating and securing the loan, and (B) qualifies from a credit standpoint, to the same extent as if the transferee were a veteran eligible for purposes specified in section 3710 of this title, for a guaranteed or insured or direct loan in an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the obligation for which the transferee has assumed liability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If any veteran disposes of residential property securing a guaranteed, insured, or direct housing loan obtained by the veteran under this chapter without receiving a release from liability with respect to such loan under subsection (a), and a default subsequently occurs which results in liability of the veteran to the Secretary on account of the loan, the Secretary may relieve the veteran of such liability if the Secretary determines, after such investigation as the Secretary deems appropriate, that the property was disposed of by the veteran in such a manner, and subject to such conditions, that the Secretary would have issued the veteran a release from liability under subsection (a) with respect to the loan if the veteran had made application therefor incident to such disposal. Failure of a transferee to assume by contract all of the liabilities of the original veteran-borrower shall bar such release of liability only in cases in which no acceptable transferee, either immediate or remote, is legally liable to the Sec<!-- PDFPage:428 -->retary for the indebtedness of the original veteran-borrower arising from termination of the loan. The failure of a veteran to qualify for release from liability under this subsection does not preclude relief from being granted under section 5302(b) of this title, if the veteran is eligible for relief under that section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) This section shall apply only to loans for which commitments are made before March 1, 1988.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, if a veteran or any other person disposes of residential property securing a loan guaranteed, insured, or made under this chapter and the veteran or other person notifies the holder of the loan in writing before the property is disposed of, the veteran or other person, as the case may be, shall be relieved of all further liability to the Secretary with respect to the loan (including liability for any loss resulting from any default of the purchaser or any subsequent owner of the property) and the application for assumption shall be approved if the holder determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the loan is current; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the purchaser of the property from such veteran or other person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is obligated by contract to purchase such property and to assume full liability for the repayment of the balance of the loan remaining unpaid and has assumed by contract all of the obligations of the veteran under the terms of the instruments creating and securing the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) qualifies from a credit standpoint, to the same extent as if the purchaser were a veteran eligible under section 3710 of this title, for a guaranteed or insured or direct loan in an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the obligation for which the purchaser is to assume liability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), paragraph (3), and paragraph (4)(C)(ii) of this subsection, the Secretary shall be considered to be the holder of the loan if the actual holder is not an approved lender described in section 3702.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the holder of the loan determines that the loan is not current or that the purchaser of the property does not meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the holder shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notify the transferor and the Secretary of such determination; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) notify the transferor that the transferor may appeal the determination to the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Upon the appeal of the transferor after a determination described in paragraph (3) is made, the Secretary shall, in a timely manner, review and make a determination (or a redetermination in any case in which the Secretary made the determination described in such paragraph) with respect to whether the loan is current and whether the purchaser of the property meets the requirements of paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection. The Secretary shall transmit, in writing, a notice of the nature of such determination to the transferor and the holder and shall inform them of the action that shall or may be taken under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph as a result of the determination of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) If the Secretary determines under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph that the loan is <!-- PDFPage:429 -->current and that the purchaser meets the requirements of paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the holder shall approve the assumption of the loan, and the transferor shall be relieved of all liability to the Secretary with respect to such loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the Secretary determines under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph that the purchaser does not meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the Secretary may direct the holder to approve the assumption of the loan if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the Secretary determines that the transferor of the property is unable to make payments on the loan and has made reasonable efforts to find a buyer who meets the requirements of paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection and that, as a result, the proposed transfer is in the best interests of the Department and the transferor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the transferor has requested, within 15 days after receiving the notice referred to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, that the Secretary approve the assumption; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) the transferor will, upon assumption of the loan by the purchaser, be secondarily liable on the loan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the loan is not approved for assumption under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph or paragraph (1) of this subsection; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) no appeal is made by the transferor under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph within 30 days after the holder informs the transferor of its determination under paragraph (3) of this subsection,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the holder may demand immediate, full payment of the principal, and all interest earned thereon, of such loan if the transferor disposes of the property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If a person disposes of residential property described in subsection (a)(1) of this section and the person fails to notify the holder of the loan before the property is disposed of, the holder, upon learning of such action by the person, may demand immediate and full payment of the principal, interest, and all other amounts owing under the terms of the loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) In any case in which the holder of a loan described in subsection (a)(1) of this section has knowledge of a person's disposing of residential property securing the loan, the holder shall notify the Secretary of such action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the holder fails to notify the Secretary in such a case, the holder shall be liable to the Secretary for any damage sustained by the Secretary as a result of the holder's failure, as determined at the time the Secretary is required to make payments in accordance with any insurance or guaranty provided by the Secretary with respect to the loan concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary shall provide that the mortgage or deed of trust and any other instrument evidencing the loan entered into by a person with respect to a loan guaranteed, insured, or made under this chapter shall contain provisions, in such form as the Secretary shall specify, implementing the requirements of this section, and shall bear in conspicuous position in capital letters on the first page of the document in type at least 2 and 1/2 times larger than the regular type on such page the following: &ldquo;This loan is not assumable without the approval of the Department of Veterans Affairs or its authorized agent.&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary shall establish in regulations a reasonable amount as the maximum amount that a lender may charge for processing an application for a creditworthiness determination and assumption of a loan pursuant to this section. Such regulations shall establish requirements for the timely processing of applications for acceptance of assumptions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) This section shall apply&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of loans other than loans to finance the purchase of real property described in section 3733(a)(1) of this title, only to loans for which commitments are made on or after March 1, 1988; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of loans to finance the purchase of such property, only to loans which are closed more than 45 days after the date of the enactment of the Veterans&rsquo; Benefits and Programs Improvement Act of 1988.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section shall not apply to a loan which the Secretary has sold without recourse.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3720. Powers of Secretary</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, with respect to matters arising by reason of this chapter, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) sue and be sued in the Secretary's official capacity in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal, but nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorizing garnishment or attachment against the Secretary, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or any of its employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) subject to specific limitations in this chapter, consent to the modification, with respect to rate of interest, time of payment of principal or interest or any portion thereof, security or other provisions of any note, contract, mortgage or other instrument securing a loan which has been guaranteed, insured, made or acquired under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) pay, or compromise, any claim on, or arising because of, any such guaranty or insurance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) pay, compromise, waive or release any right, title, claim, lien or demand, however acquired, including any equity or any right of redemption;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) purchase at any sale, public or private, upon such terms and for such prices as the Secretary determines to be reasonable, and take title to, property, real, personal or mixed; and similarly sell, at public or private sale, exchange, assign, convey, or otherwise dispose of any such property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) complete, administer, operate, obtain and pay for insurance on, and maintain, renovate, repair, modernize, lease, or otherwise deal with any property acquired or held pursuant to this chapter. The acquisition of any such property shall not deprive any State or political subdivision thereof of its civil or criminal jurisdiction of, on, or over such property (including power to tax) or impair the rights under the State or local law of any persons on such property. Without regard to section 3302(b) of title 31 or any other provision of law not expressly in limitation of this paragraph, the Secretary may permit brokers utilized by the Secretary in connection with such properties to deduct from rental collections amounts covering authorized fees, costs, and expenses incurred in connection with the management, repair, sale, or lease of any such properties and remit the net balances to the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The powers granted by this section may be exercised by the Secretary without regard to any other provision of law not enacted expressly in limitation of this section, which otherwise would govern the expenditure of public funds; however, section 3709 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5) shall apply to any contract for services or supplies on account of any property acquired pursuant to this section if the amount of such contract exceeds the amount prescribed in clause (1) of the first sentence of such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The financial transactions of the Secretary incident to, or arising out of, the guaranty or insurance of loans pursuant to this chapter, and the acquisition, management, and disposition of property, real, personal, or mixed, incident to such activities and pursuant to this section, shall be final and conclusive upon all officers of the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The right to redeem provided for by section 2410(c) of title 28 shall not arise in any case in which the subordinate lien or interest of the United States derives from a guaranteed or insured loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) The Secretary is authorized from time to time, as the Secretary determines advisable, to set aside first mortgage loans, and installment sale contracts, owned and held by the Secretary under this chapter as the basis for the sale of participation certificates as herein provided. For this purpose the Secretary may enter into agreements, including trust agreements, with the Government National Mortgage Association, and any other Federal agency, under which the Association as fiduciary may sell certificates of participation based on principal and interest collections to be received by the Secretary and the Association or any other such agency on first mortgage loans and installment sale contracts comprising mortgage pools established by them. The agreement may provide for substitution or withdrawal of mortgage loans, or installment sale contracts, or for substitution of cash for mortgages in the pool. The agreement shall provide that the Government National Mortgage Association shall promptly pay to the Secretary the entire proceeds of any sale of certificates of participation to the extent such certificates are based on mortgages, including installment sale contracts, set aside by the Secretary and the Secretary shall periodically pay to the Association, as fiduciary, such funds as are required for payment of interest and principal due on outstanding certificates of participation to the extent of the pro rata amount allocated to the Secretary pursuant to the agreement. The agreement shall also provide that the <!-- PDFPage:431 -->Secretary shall retain ownership of mortgage loans and installment sale contracts set aside by the Secretary pursuant to the agreement unless transfer of ownership to the fiduciary is required in the event of default or probable default in the payment of participation certificates. The Secretary is authorized to purchase outstanding certificates of participation to the extent of the amount of the Secretary's commitment to the fiduciary on participations outstanding and to pay the Secretary's proper share of the costs and expenses incurred by the Government National Mortgage Association as fiduciary pursuant to the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall proportionately allocate and deposit the entire proceeds received from the sale of participations into the funds established pursuant to sections 3723 and 3724 of this chapter, as determined on an estimated basis, and the amounts so deposited shall be available for the purposes of the funds. The Secretary may nevertheless make such allocations of that part of the proceeds of participation sales representing anticipated interest collections on mortgage loans, including installment sale contracts, on other than an estimated proportionate basis if determined necessary to assure payment of interest on advances theretofore made to the Secretary by the Secretary of the Treasury for direct loan purposes. The Secretary shall set aside and maintain necessary reserves in the funds established pursuant to sections 3723 and 3724 of this chapter to be used for meeting commitments pursuant to this subsection and, as the Secretary determines to be necessary, for meeting interest payments on advances by the Secretary of the Treasury for direct loan purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Whenever loss, destruction, or damage to any residential property securing loans guaranteed, insured, made, or acquired by the Secretary under this chapter occurs as the result of a major disaster as determined by the President under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), the Secretary shall (1) provide counseling and such other service to the owner of such property as may be feasible and shall inform such owner concerning the disaster assistance available from other Federal agencies and from State or local agencies, and (2) pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section, extend on an individual case basis such forebearance or indulgence to such owner as the Secretary determines to be warranted by the facts of the case and the circumstances of such owner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Secretary shall, at the request of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and without reimbursement, certify to such Secretary whether an applicant for assistance under any law administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development is a veteran.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) The Secretary may, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary considers appropriate, issue or approve the issuance of, and guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on, certificates or other securities evidencing an interest in a pool of mortgage loans made in connection with the sale of properties acquired under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not under this subsection guarantee the payment of principal and interest on certificates or other securities issued or approved after December 31, 1995.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) For the purposes of section 3711 of this title, the revolving fund heretofore established by section 513 of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 is continued in effect. For the purposes of further augmenting the revolving fund, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to advance to the Secretary from time to time after December 31, 1958, and until June 30, 1961, such sums (not in excess of $150,000,000 in any one fiscal year, including prior advancements in fiscal year 1959) as the Secretary may request, except that the aggregate so advanced in any one quarter annual period shall not exceed the sum of $50,000,000, less that amount which has been returned to the revolving fund during the preceding quarter annual period from the sale of loans pursuant to section 3711(g) of this title. In addition to the sums authorized in this subsection the Secretary of the Treasury shall also advance to the Secretary such additional sums, not in excess of $100,000,000, as the Secretary may request, and the sums so advanced shall be made available without regard to any limitation contained in this subsection with respect to the amount which may be advanced in any one quarter annual period. The Secretary of the Treasury shall also advance to the Secretary from time to time such additional sums as the Secretary may request, not in excess of $100,000,000 to be immediately available, plus an additional amount not in excess of $400,000,000 after June 30, 1961, plus $200,000,000 after June 30, 1962, plus $150,000,000 after June 30, 1963, plus $150,000,000 after June 30, 1964, plus $100,000,000 after June 30, 1965, plus $100,000,000 after June 30, 1966. Any such authorized advance which is not requested by the Secretary in the fiscal year in which the advance may be made shall be made thereafter when requested by the Secretary, except that no such request or advance may be made after June 30, 1967. Such authorized advances are not subject to the quarter annual limitation in the second sentence of this subsection, but the amount authorized to be advanced in any fiscal year after June 30, 1962, shall be reduced only by the amount which has been returned to the revolving fund during the preceding fiscal year from the sale of loans pursuant to section 3711(g) of this title. In addition the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to make available to the Secretary for this purpose from time to time as the Secretary may request the amount of any funds which may have been deposited to the credit of miscellaneous receipts under this subsection or subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) On advances to such revolving fund by the Secretary of the Treasury, less those amounts deposited in miscellaneous receipts under subsections (a) and (c) the Secretary shall pay semiannually to the Treasurer of the United States interest at the rate or rates determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average rate on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States as of the last day of the month preceding the advance. The Secretary shall not be required to pay interest on transfers made pursuant to the Act of February 13, 1962 (76 Stat. 8), from the capital of the &ldquo;direct loans to veterans and reserves revolving fund&rdquo; to the &ldquo;loan guaranty revolving fund&rdquo; and adjustments shall be made for payments of interest on such transfers before February 29, 1964.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In order to make advances to such revolving fund, as authorized by law to effectuate the purposes and functions authorized in section 3711 of this title, the Secretary of the Treasury may use, as a public debt transaction, the proceeds of the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 include such purposes. Such sums, together with all receipts under this section and section 3711 of this title, shall be deposited with the Treasurer of the United States, in a special deposit account, and shall be available, respectively, for disbursement for the purposes of section 3711 of this title. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall from time to time cause to be deposited into the Treasury of the United States, to the credit of miscellaneous receipts, such of the funds in such account as in the Secretary's judgment are not needed for the purposes for which they were provided, including the proceeds of the sale of any loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer from the direct loan revolving fund to the loan guaranty revolving fund established by section 3724(a) of this title such amounts as the Secretary determines are not needed in the direct loan revolving fund.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:434 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 30 days after the date on which the Secretary of the Treasury makes a transfer under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall submit a notice of such transfer to the appropriate committees of the Congress.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) In the event of default in the payment of any loan guaranteed under this chapter, the holder of the obligation shall notify the Secretary of such default. Upon receipt of such notice, the Secretary may, subject to subsection (c) of this section, pay to such holder the guaranty not in excess of the pro rata portion of the amount originally guaranteed. Except as provided in section 3703(e) of this title, if the Secretary makes such a payment, the Secretary shall be subrogated to the rights of the holder of the obligation to the extent of the amount paid on the guaranty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before suit or foreclosure the holder of the obligation shall notify the Secretary of the default, and within thirty days thereafter the Secretary may, at the Secretary's option, pay the holder of the obligation the unpaid balance of the obligation plus accrued interest and receive <!-- PDFPage:443 -->an assignment of the loan and security. Nothing in this section shall preclude any forebearance for the benefit of the veteran as may be agreed upon by the parties to the loan and approved by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may establish the date, not later than the date of judgment and decree of foreclosure or sale, upon which accrual of interest or charges shall cease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Upon receiving a notice pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) provide the veteran with information and, to the extent feasible, counseling regarding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) alternatives to foreclosure, as appropriate in light of the veteran's particular circumstances, including possible methods of curing the default, conveyance of the property to the Secretary by means of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, and the actions authorized by paragraph (2) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) what the Department of Veterans Affairs&rsquo; and the veteran's liabilities would be with respect to the loan in the event of foreclosure; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) advise the veteran regarding the availability of such counseling;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except with respect to loans made by a lender which the Secretary has determined has a demonstrated record of consistently providing timely and accurate information to veterans with respect to such matters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall, to the extent of the availability of appropriations, ensure that sufficient personnel are available to administer subparagraph (A) of this paragraph effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the event of default in the payment of any loan guaranteed or insured under this chapter in which a partial payment has been tendered by the veteran concerned and refused by the holder, the holder of the obligation shall notify the Secretary as soon as such payment has been refused. The Secretary may require that any such notification include a statement of the circumstances of the default, the amount tendered, the amount of the indebtedness on the date of the tender, and the reasons for the holder's refusal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) With respect to any loan made under section 3711 which has not been sold as provided in subsection (g) of such section, if the Secretary finds, after there has been a default in the payment of any installment of principal or interest owing on such loan, that the default was due to the fact that the veteran who is obligated under the loan has become unemployed as the result of the closing (in whole or in part) of a Federal installation, the Secretary shall (1) extend the time for curing the default to such time as the Secretary determines is necessary and desirable to enable such veteran to complete payments on such loan, including an extension of time beyond the stated maturity thereof, or (2) modify the terms of such loan for the purpose of changing the amortization provisions thereof by recasting, over the remaining term of the loan, or over such longer period as the Secretary may determine, the total unpaid amount then due with the modification to become effective currently or upon the termination of an agreed-upon extension of the period for curing the default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;defaulted loan&rdquo; means a loan that is guaranteed under this chapter, that was made for a purpose described in section 3710(a) of this title, and that is in default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &ldquo;liquidation sale&rdquo; means a judicial sale or other disposition of real property to liquidate a defaulted loan that is secured by such property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The term &ldquo;net value&rdquo;, with respect to real property, means the amount equal to (i) the fair market value of the property, minus (ii) the total of the amounts which the Secretary estimates the Secretary would incur (if the Secretary were to acquire and dispose of the property) for property taxes, assessments, liens, property maintenance, property improvement, administration, resale (including losses sustained on the resale of the property), and other costs resulting from the acquisition and disposition of the property, excluding any amount attributed to the cost to the Government of borrowing funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Except as provided in subparagraph (D) of paragraph (10) of this subsection, the term &ldquo;total indebtedness&rdquo;, with respect to a defaulted loan, means the amount equal to the total of (i) the unpaid principal of the loan, (ii) the interest on the loan as of the date applicable under paragraph (10) of this subsection, and (iii) such reasonably necessary and proper charges (as specified in the loan instrument and permitted by regulations prescribed by the Secretary to implement this subsection) associated with liquidation of the loan, including advances for taxes, insurance, and maintenance or repair of the real property securing the loan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, this subsection applies to any case in which the holder of a defaulted loan undertakes to liquidate the loan by means of a liquidation sale.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Before carrying out a liquidation sale of real property securing a defaulted loan, the holder of the loan shall notify the Secretary of the proposed sale. Such notice shall be provided in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary to implement this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) After receiving a notice described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall determine the net value of the property securing the loan and the amount of the total indebtedness under the loan and shall notify the holder of the loan of the determination of such net value.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A case referred to in paragraphs (5), (6), and (7) of this subsection as being described in this paragraph is a case in which the net value of the property securing a defaulted loan exceeds the amount of the total indebtedness under the loan minus the amount guaranteed under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In a case described in paragraph (4) of this subsection, if the holder of the defaulted loan <!-- PDFPage:444 -->acquires the property securing the loan at a liquidation sale for an amount that does not exceed the lesser of the net value of the property or the total indebtedness under the loan&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7) In a case described in paragraph (4) of this subsection, if the holder of the defaulted loan acquires the property securing the loan at the liquidation sale for an amount that exceeds the lesser of the total indebtedness under the loan or the net value and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) the amount was the minimum amount for which, under applicable State law, the property was permitted to be sold at the liquidation sale, the holder shall have the option to convey the property to the United States in return for payment by the Secretary of an amount equal to the lesser of the amount for which the holder acquired the property or the total indebtedness under the loan; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) there was no minimum amount for which the property had to be sold at the liquidation sale under applicable State law, the holder shall have the option to convey the property to the United States in return for payment by the Secretary of an amount equal to the lesser of such net value or total indebtedness; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the liability of the United States under the loan guaranty under this chapter is as provided in paragraph (6) of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary may not accept conveyance of the property from the holder of the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the liability of the United States under the loan guaranty shall be limited to the amount of the total indebtedness under the loan minus the amount realized by the holder of the loan incident to the sale at a liquidation sale of the property.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(10)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph, the date referred to in paragraph (1)(D)(ii) of this subsection shall be the date of the liquidation sale of the property securing the loan (or such earlier date following the expiration of a reasonable period of time for such sale to occur as the Secretary may specify pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary to implement this subsection).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Subject to division (ii) of this subparagraph, in any case in which there is a substantial delay in such sale caused by the holder of the loan exercising forebearance at the request of the Secretary, the date referred to in paragraph (1)(D)(ii) of this subsection shall be such date, on or after the date on which forebearance was requested and prior to the date of such sale, as the Secretary specifies pursuant to regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe to implement this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary may specify a date under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph only if, based on the use of a date so specified for the purposes of such paragraph (1)(D)(ii), the Secretary is authorized, under paragraph (5)(A) or (7)(A) of this subsection, to accept conveyance of the property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In any case in which there is an excessive delay in such liquidation sale caused&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may provide financial assistance to veterans&rsquo; small business concerns for the purpose of (A) financing plant construction, conversion, or expansion (including the acquisition of land), (B) financing the acquisition of equipment, facilities, machinery, supplies, or materials, or (C) supplying such concerns with working capital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to paragraph (3)(A) of this subsection, financial assistance under this section may be provided in the form of (A) loan guaranties, or (B) direct loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall specify in regulations the criteria to be met for a business concern to qualify as a veterans&rsquo; small business concern for the purposes of this subchapter. Such regulations shall include requirements&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that at least 51 percent of a business concern must be owned by individuals who are veterans of the Vietnam era or disabled veterans in order for such concern to qualify for a loan guaranty and that at least 51 percent of a business concern must be owned by disabled veterans in order for such concern to qualify for a direct loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that the management and daily business operations of the concern must be directed by one or more of the veterans whose ownership interest is part of the majority ownership for the purposes of meeting the requirement in clause (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The availability of financial assistance under subsection (a) of this section is subject to the following limitations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Secretary may not make a direct loan under this section unless the veterans&rsquo; small business concern applying for the loan shows to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the concern is unable to obtain a loan guaranteed by the Department under this section or made or guaranteed by the Small Business Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Secretary may not guarantee a loan under this section if the loan bears a rate of interest in excess of the maximum rate of interest prescribed under section 3745 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Secretary may not make or guarantee a loan under this section for an amount in excess of $200,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The original liability of the Secretary on any loan guaranteed under this section may not exceed 90 percent of the amount of the loan, and such liability shall decrease or increase pro rata with any decrease or increase of the amount of the unpaid portion of the loan, but such liability may not exceed the amount of the original guaranty.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Each loan made or guaranteed under this subchapter shall be of such sound value, taking into account the creditworthiness of the veterans&rsquo; small business concern (and the individual owners) applying for such loan, or so secured as reasonably to assure payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Secretary may not make or guarantee a loan under this subchapter to a veterans&rsquo; small business concern in which an ownership interest is held by a veteran who also has an ownership interest in another small business concern if such ownership interest was considered in qualifying that other concern for an outstanding loan made or guaranteed under this subchapter or the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not apply if 51 percent or more of the business concern seeking a direct or guaranteed loan under this subchapter is owned by veterans of the Vietnam era or disabled veterans without including the ownership interest of the veteran whose ownership interest in another small business concern was previously considered in qualifying that other concern for an outstanding guaranteed or direct business loan under this subchapter or the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:451 --><p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) In order to protect the interest of the United States, upon application by a veterans&rsquo; small business concern which is the recipient of a loan guaranteed under this subchapter, the Secretary (subject to the provisions of this subsection) may undertake the veterans&rsquo; small business concern's obligation to make payments under such loan or, if the loan was a direct loan made by the Secretary, may suspend such obligation. While such payments are being made by the Secretary pursuant to the undertaking of such obligation or while such obligation is suspended, no such payment with respect to the loan may be required from the concern.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may undertake or suspend a veterans&rsquo; small business concern's obligation under this subsection only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such undertaking or suspension of the obligation is, in the judgment of the Secretary, necessary to protect the interest of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with the undertaking or suspension of the obligation, the small business concern would, in the judgment of the Secretary, become or remain a viable small business entity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the small business concern executes an agreement in writing satisfactory to the Secretary as provided by paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The period of time for which the Secretary undertakes or suspends the obligation on a loan under this subsection may not exceed five years. The Secretary may extend the maturity of any loan on which the Secretary undertakes or suspends the obligation under this subsection for a corresponding period of time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Before the Secretary may undertake or suspend a veterans&rsquo; small business concern's obligation under this subsection, the Secretary shall require the small business concern to execute an agreement to repay the aggregate amount of the payments which were required under the loan during the period for which the obligation was undertaken or suspended&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) by periodic payments not less in amount or less frequently falling due than those which were due under the loan during such period,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) pursuant to a repayment schedule agreed upon by the Secretary and the small business concern, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) by a combination of the method of payments described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In addition to requiring the small business concern to execute the agreement described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall, before the undertaking or suspension of the obligation, take such action and require the small business concern to take such action as the Secretary considers appropriate in the circumstances, including the provision of such security as the Secretary considers necessary or appropriate, to assure that the rights and interest of the United States and any lender will be safeguarded adequately during and after the period in which such obligation is so undertaken or suspended.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the memorandum is in effect when the loan is made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall ensure that each memorandum of understanding that the Secretary enters into with a tribal organization shall provide for the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) That each Native American veteran who is under the jurisdiction of the tribal organization and to whom the Secretary makes a direct loan under this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) holds, possesses, or purchases using the proceeds of the loan a meaningful interest in a lot or dwelling (or both) that is located on trust land; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) will purchase, construct, or improve (as the case may be) a dwelling on the lot using the proceeds of the loan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) That each such Native American veteran will convey to the Secretary by an appropriate instrument the interest referred to in subparagraph (A) as security for a direct housing loan under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) That the tribal organization and each such Native American veteran will permit the Secretary to enter upon the trust land of that organization or veteran for the purposes of carrying out such actions as the Secretary determines are necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to evaluate the advisability of the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to monitor any purchase, construction, or improvements carried out using the proceeds of the loan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) That the tribal organization has established standards and procedures that apply to the foreclosure of the interest conveyed by a Native American veteran pursuant to subparagraph (B), including&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) That the tribal organization agrees to such other terms and conditions with respect to the making of direct loans to Native American veterans under the jurisdiction of the tribal organization as the Secretary may require in order to ensure that the pilot program established under this subchapter is implemented in a responsible and prudent manner.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may make loans exceeding the amount specified in subparagraph (A) in a geographic area if the Secretary determines that housing costs in the area are significantly higher than average housing costs nationwide. The amount of such increase shall be the amount that the Secretary determines is necessary in order to carry out the pilot program under this subchapter in a manner that demonstrates the advisability of making direct housing loans to Native American veterans who are located in a variety of geographic areas and in geographic areas experiencing a variety of economic conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Loans made under this section shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary, which rate may not exceed the appropriate rate authorized for guaranteed loans under section 3703(c)(1) or section 3712(f) of this title, and shall be subject to such requirements or limitations prescribed for loans guaranteed under this title as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall determine the reasonable value of the interest in property that will serve as security for a loan made under this section and shall establish procedures for appraisals upon which the Secretary may base such determinations. The procedures shall incorporate generally the relevant requirements of section 3731 of this title, unless the Secretary determines that such requirements are impracticable to implement in a geographic area, on particular trust lands, or under circumstances specified by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Loans made under this section shall be repaid in monthly installments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) In connection with any loan under this section, the Secretary may make advances in cash to provide for repairs, alterations, and improvements and to meet incidental expenses of the loan transaction.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) As long as unemployment and underemployment continue as serious problems among disabled veterans and Vietnam-era veterans, alleviating unemployment and underemployment among such veterans is a national responsibility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Because of the special nature of employment and training needs of such veterans and the national responsibility to meet those needs, policies and programs to increase opportunities for such veterans to obtain employment, job training, counseling, and job placement services and assistance in securing advancement in employment should be effectively and vigorously implemented by the Secretary of Labor and such implementation should be accomplished through the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans&rsquo; Employment and Training.</p>

<p class="note-body">On June 16, 1971, I issued Executive Order No. 11598 to facilitate the employment of returning veterans by requiring Federal agencies and Federal contractors and their subcontractors to list employment openings with the employment service systems. Section 503 of the Vietnam Era Veterans&rsquo; Readjustment Assistance Act of 1972 (Public Law 92&ndash;540; 86 Stat. 1097) added a new section 2012 [now 4212] to Title 38 of the United States Code which, in effect, provides statutory authority to extend the program developed under that order with respect to Government contractors and their subcontractors.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code and as President of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>

The Secretary of Labor shall issue rules and regulations requiring each department and agency of the executive branch of the Federal Government to list suitable employment openings with the appropriate office of the State Employment Service or the United States Employment Service. This section shall not be construed as requiring the employment of individuals referred by such office or as superseding any requirements of the Civil Service Laws. Rules, regulations, and orders to implement this section shall be developed in consultation with the Civil Service Commission.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. The Secretary of Labor is hereby designated and empowered to exercise, without the approval, ratification, or other action of the President, the authority of the President under Section 2012 [now 4212] of Title 38 of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. The Secretary of Labor shall gather information on the effectiveness of the program established under this order and Section 2012 [now 4212] of Title 38 of the United States Code and of the extent to which the employment service system is fulfilling the employment needs of veterans.

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The United States has an obligation to assist veterans of the Armed Forces in readjusting to civilian life since veterans, by virtue of their military service, have lost opportunities to pursue education and training oriented toward civilian careers. The Federal Government is also continuously concerned with building an effective work force, and veterans constitute a major recruiting source. It is, therefore, the policy of the United States and the purpose of this section to promote the maximum of employment and job advancement opportunities within the Federal Government for disabled veterans and certain veterans of the Vietnam era and of the post-Vietnam era who are qualified for such employment and advancement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;agency&rdquo; means a department, agency, or instrumentality in the executive branch.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) To further the policy stated in subsection (a) of this section, veterans referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be eligible, in accordance with regulations which the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe, for veterans readjustment appointments, and for subsequent career-conditional appointments, under the terms and conditions specified in Executive Order Numbered 11521 (March 26, 1970), except that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a veteran receiving such an appointment shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in the case of a veteran with less than 15 years of education, receive training or education; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) upon successful completion of the prescribed probationary period, acquire a competitive status; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) a veteran given an appointment under the authority of this subsection whose employment under the appointment is terminated within one year after the date of such appointment shall have the same right to appeal that termination to the Merit Systems Protection Board as a career or career-conditional employee has during the first year of employment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This subsection applies to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a veteran of the Vietnam era; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) December 31, 1995,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">whichever is later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Except as provided in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, a veteran described in paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection may receive such an appointment only within the 10-year period following the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the date of the veteran's last discharge or release from active duty; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) December 31, 1989.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The limitations of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph shall not apply to a veteran who has a service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of clause (i) of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, the last discharge or release from active duty shall not include any discharge or release from active duty of less than ninety days of continuous service unless the individual involved is discharged or released for a service-connected disability, for a medical condition which preexisted such service and which the Secretary determines is not service connected, for hardship, or as a result of a reduction in force described in section 3011(a)(1)(A)(ii)(III) of this title or of an involuntary separation described in section 3018A(a)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Each agency shall include in its affirmative action plan for the hiring, placement, and advancement of handicapped individuals in such agency as required by section 501(b) of the Reha<!-- PDFPage:484 -->bilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791(b)), a separate specification of plans (in accordance with regulations which the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe in consultation with the Secretary, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, consistent with the purposes, provisions, and priorities of such Act) to promote and carry out such affirmative action with respect to disabled veterans in order to achieve the purpose of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Office of Personnel Management shall be responsible for the review and evaluation of the implementation of this section and the activities of each agency to carry out the purpose and provisions of this section.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The number of such terminations since the last such report that were initiated by the agency involved and the number of such terminations since the last such report that were initiated by the individual involved.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notwithstanding section 4211 of this title, the terms &ldquo;veteran&rdquo; and &ldquo;disabled veteran&rdquo; as used in subsection (a) of this section shall have the meaning provided for under generally applicable civil service law and regulations.</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">CHAPTER 43&mdash;VETERANS&rsquo; REEMPLOYMENT RIGHTS</h4>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&sect;4301. Right to reemployment of inducted persons; benefits protected</h4>
<p class="note-body">(a) In the case of any person who is inducted into the Armed Forces of the United States under the Military Selective Service Act (or under any prior or subsequent corresponding law) for training and service and who leaves a position (other than a temporary position) in the employ of any employer in order to perform such training and service, and (1) receives a certificate described in section 9(a) of the Military Selective Service Act (relating to the satisfactory completion of military service), and (2) makes application for reemployment within ninety days after such person is relieved from such training and service or from hospitalization continuing after discharge for a period of not more than one year&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) if such position was in the employ of the United States Government, its territories, or possessions, or political subdivisions thereof, or the District of Columbia, such person shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(i) if still qualified to perform the duties of such position or able to become requalified with reasonable efforts by the employer, be restored to such position or to a position of like seniority, status, and pay; or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(ii) if not qualified to perform the duties of such position or able to become requalified with reasonable efforts by the employer, by reason of disability sustained during such service, but qualified to perform the duties of any other position in the employ of the employer, be offered employment and, if such person so requests, be employed in such other position the duties of which such person is qualified to perform as will provide such person like seniority, status, and pay, or the nearest approximation thereof consistent with the circumstances in such person's case;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) if such position was in the employ of a State, or political subdivision thereof, or a private employer, such person shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(i) if still qualified to perform the duties of such position or able to become requalified with reasonable efforts by the employer, be restored by such employer or the employer's successor in interest to such position or to a position of like seniority, status, and pay; or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(ii) if not qualified to perform the duties of such position or able to become requalified with reasonable efforts by the employer, by reason of disability sustained during such service, but qualified to perform the duties of any other position in the employ of such employer or the employer's successor in interest, be offered employment and, if such person so requests, be employed by such employer or the employer's successor in interest in such other position the duties of which such person is qualified to perform as will provide such person like seniority, status, and pay, or the nearest approximation thereof consistent with the circumstances in such person's case,</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">unless the employer's circumstances have so changed as to make it impossible or unreasonable to do so. Nothing in this chapter shall excuse noncompliance with any statute or ordinance of a State or political subdivision thereof establishing greater or additional rights or protections than the rights and protections established pursuant to this chapter.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b)(1)(A) Any person who is restored to or employed in a position in accordance with the provisions of clause (A) or (B) of subsection (a) of this section shall be considered as having been on furlough or leave of absence during such person's period of training and service in the Armed Forces, shall be so restored or reemployed without loss of seniority, shall be entitled to participate in insurance or other benefits offered by the employer pursuant to established rules and practices relating to employees on furlough or leave of absence in effect with the employer at the time such person was inducted into such forces, and shall not be discharged from such position without cause within one year after such restoration or reemployment.</p>
<p class="note-body">(B) In the case of employer-offered health insurance, an exclusion or waiting period may not be imposed in connection with coverage of a health or physical condition of a person entitled to participate in that insurance under subparagraph (A), or a health or physical condition of any other person who is covered by the insurance by reason of the coverage of such person, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) the condition arose before or during that person's period of training or service in the Armed Forces;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) an exclusion or waiting period would not have been imposed for the condition during a period of coverage resulting from participation by such person in the insurance; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) the condition of such person has not been determined by the Secretary to be service-connected.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) It is hereby declared to be the sense of the Congress that any person who is restored to or employed in a position in accordance with the provisions of clause (A) or (B) of subsection (a) of this section should be so restored or reemployed in such manner as to give such person such status in the person's employment as the person would have enjoyed if such person had continued in such employment continuously from the time of such person's entering the Armed Forces until the time of such person's restoration to such employment, or reemployment.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Any person who seeks or holds a position described in clause (A) or (B) of subsection (a) of this section shall not be denied hiring, retention in employment, or any promotion or other incident or advantage of employment because of any obligation as a member of a Reserve component of the Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The rights granted by subsections (a) and (b) of this section to persons who left the employ of a State or political subdivision thereof and were inducted into the Armed Forces shall not diminish any rights such persons may have pursuant to any statute or ordinance of such State or political subdivision establishing greater or additional rights or protections.</p>

<p class="note-body">(b)(1) Any person who, after entering the employment on the basis of which such person claims restoration or reemployment, enters upon active duty (other than for the purpose of determining physical fitness and other than for training), whether or not voluntarily, in the Armed Forces of the United States or the Public Health Service in response to an order or call to active duty shall, upon such person's relief from active duty under honorable conditions, be entitled to all of the reemployment rights and benefits provided for by this chapter in the case of persons inducted under the provisions of the Military Selective Service Act (or prior or subsequent legislation providing for the involuntary induction of persons into the Armed Forces), if the total of such active duty performed between June 24, 1948, and August 1, 1961, did not exceed four years, and the total of any such active duty, additional or otherwise, performed after August 1, 1961, does not exceed four years (plus in each case any additional period in which such person was unable to obtain orders relieving such person from active duty).</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Any member of a Reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States who voluntarily or involuntarily enters upon active duty (other than for the purpose of determining physical fitness and other than for training) or whose active duty is voluntarily or involuntarily extended during a period when the President is authorized to order units of the Ready Reserve or members of a Reserve component to active duty shall have the service limitation governing eligibility for reemployment rights under subsection (b)(1) of this section extended by such member's period of such active duty, but not to exceed that period of active duty to which the President is authorized to order units of the Ready Reserve or members of a Reserve component. With respect to a member who voluntarily enters upon active duty or whose active duty is voluntarily extended, the provisions of this subsection shall apply only when such additional active duty is at the request and for the convenience of the Federal Government.</p>

Upon such employee's release from a period of such active duty for training or inactive duty training, or upon such employee's discharge from hospitalization incident to that training, such employee shall be permitted to return to such employee's position with such seniority, status, pay, and vacation as such employee would have had if such employee had not been absent for such purposes. Such employee shall report for work at the beginning of the next regularly scheduled working period after expiration of the last calendar day necessary to travel from the place of training to the place of employment following such employee's release, or within a reasonable time thereafter if delayed return is due to factors beyond the employee's control. Failure to report for work at such next regularly scheduled working period shall make the employee subject to the conduct rules of the employer pertaining to explanations and discipline with respect to absence from scheduled work. If such an employee is hospitalized incident to active duty for training or inactive duty training, such employee shall be required to report for work at the beginning of the next regularly scheduled work period after expiration of the time necessary to travel from the place of discharge from hospitalization to the place of employment, or within a reasonable time thereafter if delayed return is due to factors beyond the employee's control, or within one year after such employee's release from active duty for training or inactive duty training, whichever is earlier. If an employee covered by this subsection is not qualified to perform the duties of such employee's position by reason of disability sustained during active duty for training or inactive duty training, but is qualified to perform the duties of any other position in the employ of the employer or such employer's successor in interest, such employee shall be offered employment and, if such person so requests, be employed by that employer or such employer's successor in interest in such other position the duties of which such employee is qualified to perform as will provide such employee like seniority, status, and pay, or the nearest approximation thereof consistent with the circumstances in such employee's case.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Any employee not covered by subsection (c) of this section who holds a position described in clause (A) or (B) of section 4321(a) [4301(a)] shall be considered as having been on leave of absence during the period required to report for the purpose of being inducted into, entering, or determining, by a preinduction or other examination, physical fitness to enter the Armed Forces. Upon such employee's rejection, upon completion of such employee's preinduction or other examination, or upon such employee's discharge from hospitalization incident to such rejection or examination, such employee shall be permitted to return to such employee's position in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) For the purposes of subsections (c) and (d) of this section, full-time training or other full-time duty performed by a member of the National Guard under section 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505 of title 32 is considered active duty for training. For the purposes of subsection (d) of this section, inactive duty training performed by that member under section 502 of title 32 or section 206, 301, 309, 402, or 1002 of title 37 is considered inactive duty training.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) Any member of a Reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States who is ordered to active duty (other than for training) under section 673b of title 10, United States Code, whether or not voluntarily, shall be entitled to all reemployment rights and benefits provided under subsection (c) of this section for persons ordered to an initial period of active duty for training of not less than twelve consecutive weeks; and shall have the service limitation governing eligibility for reemployment rights under subsections (a) and (b)(1) of this section extended by the period of such active duty, including any period of extension of active duty under section 673b of title 10.</p>

Except as provided in subparagraph (B), such period of recovery may not exceed two years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Such two-year period shall be extended by the minimum time required to accommodate the circumstances beyond such person's control which make reporting within the period specified in subparagraph (A) impossible or unreasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A person who fails to report or apply for employment or reemployment within the appropriate period specified in this subsection shall not automatically forfeit such person's entitlement to the rights and benefits referred to in subsection (a) but shall be subject to the conduct rules, established policy, and general practices of the employer pertaining to explanations and discipline with respect to absence from scheduled work.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Documentation of any matter referred to in paragraph (1) that satisfies regulations prescribed by the Secretary shall satisfy the documentation requirements in such paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the failure of a person to provide documentation that satisfies regulations prescribed pursuant to paragraph (2) shall not be a basis for denying reemployment in accordance with the provisions of this chapter if the failure occurs because such documentation does not exist or is not readily available at the time of the request of the employer. If, after such reemployment, documentation becomes available that establishes that such person does not meet one or more of the requirements referred to in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph (1), the employer of such person may terminate the employment of the person and the provision of any rights or benefits afforded the person under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An employer who reemploys a person absent from a position of employment for more than 90 days may require that the person provide the employer with the documentation referred to in subparagraph (A) before beginning to treat the person as not having incurred a break in service for pension purposes under section 4318(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An employer may not delay or attempt to defeat a reemployment obligation by demanding documentation that does not then exist or is not then readily available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The right of a person to reemployment under this section shall not entitle such person to retention, preference, or displacement rights over any person with a superior claim under the provisions of title 5, United States Code, relating to veterans and other preference eligibles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) In any determination of a person's entitlement to protection under this chapter, the timing, frequency, and duration of the person's training or service, or the nature of such training or service (including voluntary service) in the uniformed services, shall not be a basis for denying protection of this chapter if the service does not exceed the limitations set forth in subsection (c) and the notice requirements established in subsection (a)(1) and the notification requirements established in subsection (e) are met.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of benefits under the Thrift Savings Plan, the rights of a person reemployed under this chapter shall be those rights provided in section 8432b of title 5.

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A person reemployed under this chapter shall be treated as not having incurred a break in service with the employer or employers maintaining the plan by reason of such person's period or periods of service in the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Each period served by a person in the uniformed services shall, upon reemployment under this chapter, be deemed to constitute service with the employer or employers maintaining the plan for the purpose of determining the nonforfeitability of the person's accrued benefits and for the purpose of determining the accrual of benefits under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) An employer reemploying a person under this chapter shall, with respect to a period of service described in subsection (a)(2)(B), be liable to an employee pension benefit plan for funding any obligation of the plan to provide the benefits described in subsection (a)(2) and shall allocate the amount of any employer contribution for the person in the same manner and to the same extent the allocation occurs for other employees during the period of service. For purposes of determining the amount of such liability and any obligation of the plan, earnings and forfeitures shall not be included. For purposes of determining the amount of such liability and for purposes of section 515 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or any similar Federal or State law governing pension benefits for governmental employees, service in the uniformed services that is deemed under subsection (a) to be service with the employer shall be deemed to be service with the employer under the terms of the plan or any applicable collective bargaining agreement.

No such payment may exceed the amount the person would have been permitted or required to contribute had the person remained continuously employed by the employer throughout the period of service described in subsection (a)(2)(B). Any payment to the plan described in this paragraph shall be made during the period beginning with the date of reemployment and whose duration is three times the period of the person's service in the uniformed services, not to exceed five years.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Any employer who reemploys a person under this chapter and who is an employer contributing to a multiemployer plan, as defined in section 3(37) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, under which benefits are or may be payable to such person by reason of the obligations set forth in this chapter, shall, within 30 days after the date of such reemployment, provide information, in writing, of <!-- PDFPage:500 -->such reemployment to the administrator of such plan.</p>
