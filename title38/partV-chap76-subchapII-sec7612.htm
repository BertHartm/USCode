<p class="statutory-body">(4) Before awarding the initial scholarship in a course of education or training other than medicine or nursing, the Secretary shall notify the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives of the Secretary's intent to award a scholarship in such course of education or training.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of a participant who is a part-time student&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the period of obligated service shall be reduced in accordance with the proportion that the number of credit hours carried by such participant in any such school year bears to the number of credit hours required to be carried by a full-time student in the course of training being pursued by the participant, but in no event to less than one year; and</p>
