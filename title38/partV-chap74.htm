<p class="statutory-body">(b) Special pay may be paid to a physician or dentist under this subchapter only upon the execution of, and for the duration of, a written agreement entered into by the physician or dentist in accordance with section 7432 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A physician or dentist serving a period of obligated service pursuant to chapter 76 of this title is not eligible for special pay under this subchapter during the first three years of such obligated service, except that, at the discretion of the Secretary and upon the recommendation of the Under Secretary for Health, such a physician or dentist may be paid special pay for full-time status during those three years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Secretary may determine categories of positions applicable to either physicians or dentists, or both, in the Veterans Health Administration as to which there is no significant recruitment and retention problem. While any such determination is in effect, the Secretary may not enter into an agreement under this subchapter with a physician or dentist serving in a position covered by the determination. Before making a determination under this paragraph, the Secretary shall receive the recommendations of the Under Secretary for Health with respect to the determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than one year after making any such determination with respect to a category of positions, and each year thereafter that such determination remains in effect, the Secretary shall make a redetermination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any determination under this subsection shall be in accordance with regulations prescribed to carry out this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If the Under Secretary for Health determines that payment of special pay to a physician or dentist who is employed on a less than half-time basis is the most cost-effective way available for providing needed medical or dental specialist services at a Department facility, the Under Secretary for Health may authorize the payment of special pay for factors other than for full-time status to that physician or dentist at a rate computed on the basis of the proportion that the part-time employment of the physician or dentist bears to full-time employment.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary may waive (in whole or in part) the requirement for a refund under paragraph (1) in any case if the Secretary determines (in accordance with regulations prescribed under section 7431(a) of this title) that the failure to complete such period of service is the result of <!-- PDFPage:666 -->circumstances beyond the control of the physician or dentist.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may suspend a special pay agreement entered into under this section in the case of a physician or dentist who, having entered into the special pay agreement, enters a residency training program. Any such suspension shall terminate when the physician or dentist completes, withdraws from, or is no longer a participant in the program. During the period of such a suspension, the physician or dentist is not subject to the provisions of paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any such agreement shall specify the terms under which the Department and the physician or dentist may elect to terminate the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) If a proposed agreement under this subchapter will provide a total annual amount of special pay to be provided to a physician or dentist who has previously entered into an agreement under this subchapter (or under section 4118&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7432_1_target" name="7432_1">1</a></sup> of this title as in effect before the effective date of the Department of Veterans Affairs Physician and Dentist Recruitment and Retention Act of 1991) that will exceed the previous annual amount of special pay provided for the physician or dentist by more than 50 percent (other than in the case of a physician or dentist employed in an executive position in the Central Office of the Department), or that will be less than the previous annual amount of special pay provided for the physician or dentist by more than 25 percent, the proposed agreement shall be promptly submitted to the Secretary. The proposed agreement shall not take effect if it is disapproved by the Secretary within 60 days after the date on which the physician or dentist entered into the proposed agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the previous annual amount of special pay provided for a physician or dentist is the total annual amount of special pay provided, or to be provided, to the physician or dentist for the most recent year covered by an agreement entered into by the physician or dentist under this subchapter or under section 4118&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7432_1_target" name="7432_1">1</a></sup> of this title. In the case of an agreement entered into under section 4118&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7432_1_target" name="7432_1">1</a></sup> of this title, incentive pay shall be treated as special pay for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall adjust special pay as necessary for purposes of this subsection to reflect appropriately any change in the status of a physician or dentist (A) from full-time status to part-time status, (B) from part-time status to full-time status, or (C) from one proportion of time spent as a Department employee under part-time status employment to a different proportion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) If a proposed agreement under this subchapter (other than an agreement in the case of the Under Secretary for Health) will provide a total annual amount of special pay to be provided to a physician or dentist which, when added to the amount of basic pay of the physician or dentist, will be in excess of the amount payable for positions specified in section 5312 of title 5, the proposed agreement shall be promptly submitted for approval to the Secretary through the Under Secretary for Health. The agreement shall take effect at the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the physician or dentist entered into the proposed agreement if it is neither approved nor disapproved within that 60-day period. If the agreement is approved within that period, the agreement shall take effect as of the date of the approval. A proposed agreement may be disapproved under this paragraph only if it is determined that the amounts of special pay proposed to be paid are not necessary to recruit or retain the physician or dentist.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A proposed agreement under this subchapter with the Under Secretary for Health may provide for payment of special pay for which the Under Secretary for Health is eligible under this subchapter (other than that specified in section 7433(b)(4)(B) of this title) only to the extent specifically approved by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall include in the annual report required by section 7440 of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a statement of the number of agreements entered into during the period covered by the report under which the total amount of special pay to be provided, when added to the amount of basic pay of the physician or dentist, will be in excess of the amount payable for positions specified in section 5312 of title 5;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a statement of the number of proposed agreements which during the period covered by the report were disapproved under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a detailed explanation of the basis for disapproval of each such proposed agreement which was disapproved under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This subsection does not apply to any proposed agreement entered into after September 30, 1994.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In order to make possible the recruitment and retention of a well-qualified work force of physicians and dentists capable of providing quality care for eligible veterans, it is the policy of Congress to ensure that the levels of total pay for physicians and dentists of the Veterans Health Administration are fixed at levels reasonably comparable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) with the levels of total pay of physicians and dentists employed by or serving in other departments and agencies of the Federal Government; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) with the income of non-Federal physicians and dentists for the performance of services as physicians and dentists.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) To assist the Congress and the President in carrying out the policy stated in subsection (a), the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) define the bases for pay distinctions, if any, among various categories of physicians and dentists, including distinctions between physicians and dentists employed by the Veterans Health Administration and physicians and dentists employed by other departments and agencies of the Federal Government and between all Federal sector and non-Federal sector physicians and dentists; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) obtain measures of income from the employment or practice of physicians and dentists outside the Administration, including both the Federal and non-Federal sectors, for use as guidelines for setting and periodically adjusting the amounts of special pay for physicians and dentists of the Administration.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall submit to the President a report, on such date as the President may designate but not later than December 31, 1994, and once every four years thereafter, recommending appropriate rates of special pay to carry out the policy set forth in subsection (a) with respect to the pay of physicians and dentists in the Veterans Health Administration. The Secretary shall include in such report, when considered appropriate and necessary by the Secretary, recommendations for modifications of the special pay levels set forth in this subchapter whenever&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Department is unable to recruit or retain a sufficient work force of well-qualified physicians and dentists in the Administration because the incomes and other employee benefits, to the extent that those benefits are reasonably quantifiable, of physicians and dentists outside the Administration who perform comparable types of duties are significantly in excess of the levels of total pay (including basic pay and special pay) and other employee benefits, to the extent that those benefits are reasonably quantifiable, available to those physicians and dentists employed by the Administration; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) other extraordinary circumstances are such that special pay levels are needed to recruit or retain a sufficient number of well-qualified physicians and dentists.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) The President shall include in the budget transmitted to the Congress under section 1105 of title 31 after the submission of each report of the Secretary under subsection (b)(2) recommendations with respect to the exact rates of special pay for physicians and dentists under this subchapter and the cost of those rates compared with the cost of the special pay rates in effect under this subchapter at the time the budget is transmitted.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7451. Nurses and other health-care personnel: competitive pay</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) It is the purpose of this section to ensure, by a means providing increased responsibility and authority to directors of Department health-care facilities, that the rates of basic pay for health-care personnel positions described in paragraph (2) in each Department health-care facility (including the rates of basic pay of personnel employed in such positions on a part-time basis) are sufficient for that facility to be competitive, on the basis of pay and other employee benefits, with non-Department health-care facilities in the same labor-market area in the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel for those positions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The health-care personnel positions referred to in paragraph (1) (hereinafter in this section referred to as &ldquo;covered positions&rdquo;) are the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Registered nurse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Such positions referred to in paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 7401 of this title (other than the positions of physician, dentist, and registered nurse) as the Secretary may determine upon the recommendation of the Under Secretary for Health.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the rates of basic pay for covered positions in the Department shall be established and adjusted in accordance with this section instead of subsection (b)(1) of section 7404 of this title or chapter 53 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Under such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe, the Secretary shall establish and adjust the rates of basic pay for covered positions at the following health-care facilities in order to provide rates of basic pay that enable the Secretary to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of health-care personnel in such positions at those facilities:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The Veterans Memorial Medical Center in the Republic of the Philippines.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Department of Veterans Affairs health-care facilities located outside the contiguous States, Alaska, and Hawaii.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary, after receiving the recommendation of the Under Secretary for Health, shall prescribe regulations setting forth criteria and procedures to carry out this section and section 7452 of this title. Requirements in such regulations for directors to provide and maintain documentation of actions taken under this section shall require no more documentation than the minimum essential for responsible administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary shall maintain the five grade levels for nurses employed by the Department under section 7401(1) of this title as specified in the Nurse Schedule in section 7404(b) of this title. The Secretary shall, pursuant to regulations prescribed to carry out this subchapter, establish grades for other covered positions as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) For each grade in a covered position, there shall be a range of basic pay. The maximum rate of basic pay for a grade shall be 133 <!-- PDFPage:673 -->percent of the minimum rate of basic pay for the grade, except that, if the Secretary determines that a higher maximum rate is necessary with respect to any such grade in order to recruit and retain a sufficient number of high-quality health-care personnel, the Secretary may raise the maximum rate of basic pay for that grade to a rate not in excess of 175 percent of the minimum rate of basic pay for the grade. Whenever the Secretary exercises the authority under the preceding sentence to establish the maximum rate of basic pay at a rate in excess of 133 percent of the minimum rate for that grade, the Secretary shall, in the next annual report required by subsection (g), provide justification for doing so to the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The maximum rate of basic pay for any grade for a covered position may not exceed the maximum rate of basic pay established for positions in level V of the Executive Schedule under section 5316 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The range of basic pay for each such grade shall be divided into equal increments, known as &ldquo;steps&rdquo;. The Secretary shall prescribe the number of steps. Each grade in a covered position shall have the same number of steps. Rates of pay within a grade may not be established at rates other than whole steps. Any increase (other than an adjustment under subsection (d)) within a grade in the rate of basic pay payable to an employee in a covered position shall be by one or more of such step increments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The rates of basic pay for each grade in a covered position shall be adjusted periodically in accordance with this subsection in order to achieve the purposes of this section. Such adjustments shall be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) whenever there is an adjustment under section 5305 of title 5 in the rates of pay under the General Schedule, with the adjustment under this subsection to have the same effective date as the adjustment in the rates of basic pay under the General Schedule; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) at such additional times as the director of a Department health-care facility, with respect to employees in that grade at that facility, or the Under Secretary for Health, with respect to covered Regional and Central Office employees in that grade, determines.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An adjustment in rates of basic pay under this subsection for a grade shall be carried out by adjusting the amount of the minimum rate of basic pay for that grade in accordance with paragraph (3) and then adjusting the other rates for that grade to conform to the requirements of subsection (c). Such an adjustment in the minimum rate of basic pay for a grade shall be made by the director of a Department health-care facility so as to achieve consistency with the beginning rate of compensation for corresponding health-care professionals in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) labor-market area of that facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In the case of a Department health-care facility located in an area for which there is current information, based upon an industry-wage survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for that labor market, on beginning rates of compensation for corresponding health-care professionals for the BLS labor-market area of that facility, the director of the facility concerned shall use that information as the basis for making adjustments in rates of pay under this subsection. Whenever the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the results of a new industry-wage survey for that labor market that includes information on beginning rates of compensation for corresponding health-care professionals, the director of that facility shall determine, not later than 30 days after the results of the survey are released, whether an adjustment in rates of pay for employees at that facility for any covered position is necessary in order to meet the purposes of this section. If the director determines that such an adjustment is necessary, the adjustment, based upon the information determined in the survey, shall take effect on the first day of the first pay period beginning after that determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a Department health-care facility located in an area for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not have current information on beginning rates of compensation for corresponding health-care professionals for the labor-market area of that facility for any covered position, the director of that facility shall conduct a survey in accordance with this subparagraph and shall adjust the amount of the minimum rate of basic pay for grades in that covered position at that facility based upon that survey. Any such survey shall be conducted in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Those regulations shall be developed in consultation with the Secretary of Labor in order to ensure that the director of a facility collects information that is valid and reliable and is consistent with standards of the Bureau. The survey should be conducted using methodology comparable to that used by the Bureau in making industry-wage surveys except to the extent determined infeasible by the Secretary. Upon conducting a survey under this subparagraph, the director concerned shall determine, not later than 30 days after the date on which the collection of information through the survey is completed, whether an adjustment in rates of pay for employees at that facility for any covered position is necessary in order to meet the purposes of this section. If the director determines that such an adjustment is necessary, the adjustment, based upon the information determined in the survey, shall take effect on the first day of the first pay period beginning after that determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) A director of a Department health-care facility may use data on the beginning rates of compensation paid to certified registered nurse anesthetists who are employed on a salary basis by entities that provide anesthesia services through certified registered nurse anesthetists in the labor-market area only if the director&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) has conducted a survey of beginning rates of compensation for certified registered nurse anesthetists in the local labor-market area of the facility under subparagraph (B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) has used all available administrative authority with regard to collection of survey data; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) makes a determination (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) that such <!-- PDFPage:674 -->survey methods are insufficient to permit the adjustments referred to in subparagraph (B) for such nurse anesthetists employed by the facility.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For the purposes of this subparagraph, certified registered nurse anesthetists who are so employed by such entities shall be deemed to be corresponding health-care professionals to the certified registered nurse anesthetists employed by the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The authority of the director to use such additional data under this subparagraph with respect to certified registered nurse anesthetists expires on January 1, 1998.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Under Secretary for Health shall prescribe regulations providing for the adjustment of the rates of basic pay for Regional and Central Office employees in covered positions in order to assure that those rates are sufficient and competitive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) The director of a facility or Under Secretary for Health may not adjust rates of basic pay under this subsection for any pay grade so that the minimum rate of basic pay for that grade is greater than the beginning rates of compensation for corresponding positions at non-Department health-care facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the director of a Department health-care facility, or the Under Secretary for Health with respect to Regional and Central Office employees, determines, after any survey under paragraph (3)(B) or at any other time that an adjustment in rates of pay is scheduled to take place under this subsection, that it is not necessary to adjust the rates of basic pay for employees in a grade of a covered position at that facility in order to carry out the purpose of this section, such an adjustment for employees at that facility in that grade shall not be made. Whenever a director makes such a determination, the director shall within 10 days notify the Under Secretary for Health of the decision and the reasons for the decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Information collected by the Department in surveys conducted under this subsection is not subject to disclosure under section 552 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;beginning rate of compensation&rdquo;, with respect to health-care personnel positions in non-Department health-care facilities corresponding to a grade of a covered position, means the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the minimum rate of pay established for personnel in such positions who have education, training, and experience equivalent or similar to the education, training, and experience required for health-care personnel employed in the same category of Department covered positions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) other employee benefits for those positions to the extent that those benefits are reasonably quantifiable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &ldquo;corresponding&rdquo;, with respect to health-care personnel positions in non-Department health-care facilities, means those positions for which the education, training, and experience requirements are equivalent or similar to the education, training, and experience requirements for health-care personnel positions in Department health-care facilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Adjustments in rates of basic pay under subsection (d) may increase or reduce the rates of basic pay applicable to any grade of a covered position. In the case of such an adjustment that reduces the rates of pay for a grade, an employee serving at a Department health-care facility on the day before the effective date of that adjustment in a position affected by the adjustment may not (by reason of that adjustment) incur a reduction in the rate of basic pay applicable to that employee so long as the employee continues to serve in that covered position at that facility. If such an employee is subsequently promoted to a higher grade, or advanced to a higher step within the employee's grade, for which the rate of pay as so adjusted is lower than the employee's rate of basic pay on the day before the effective date of the promotion, the employee shall continue to be paid at a rate of basic pay not less than the rate of basic pay applicable to the employee before the promotion so long as the employee continues to serve in that covered position at that facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Not later than February 1 of 1991, 1992, and 1993, the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives a report regarding any pay adjustments under the authority of subsection (d)(1)(A) effective during the 12 months preceding the submission of the report. Each such report shall set forth, by health-care facility, the percentage of such increases and, in any case in which no increase was made, the basis for not providing an increase.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Not later than December 1 of 1991, 1992, and 1993, the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives a report regarding the exercise of the authorities provided in this section for the preceding fiscal year. Each such report shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A review of the use of the authorities provided in this section (including the Secretary's and Under Secretary for Health's actions, findings, recommendations, and other activities under this section) during the preceding fiscal year, including an assessment of the effects of the exercise of such authorities on the ability of the Department to recruit and retain qualified health-care professionals for covered positions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The plans for the use of the authorities provided in this subchapter for the next fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A description of the rates of basic pay in effect during the preceding fiscal year, with a comparison to the rates in effect during the previous fiscal year, shown by facility and by covered position.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The numbers of employees in covered positions (shown separately for registered nurses and for each other covered position) who during the preceding fiscal year (A) left employment with the Department, (B) left employment at one Department medical facility for employment at another Department medical facility, or (C) changed from full-time status to part-time status (and from part-time status to full-time status), and a summary of the reasons therefor.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:675 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The number of vacancies in covered positions in the Administration and a summary of the reasons that those positions are vacant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The number of employees who during the preceding fiscal year left employment at a health-care facility in one Bureau of Labor Statistics labor-market area for employment at a health-care facility in another such labor-market area, without changing residence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Justification for setting the maximum rate of basic pay for any grade at a rate in excess of 133 percent of the minimum rate of basic pay for that grade.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The discussion required by section 7452(b)(2) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The justification required by section 7452(e) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The number of nurses, shown by facility and by grade, who are on pay retention or in the top step of any grade and, with respect to those employees, comprehensive information (by facility) as to whether an extension of the pay grades was sought for these positions, and with respect to each such request for extension, whether such request was granted or denied.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) For the purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;health-care facility&rdquo; means a medical center, an independent outpatient clinic, or an independent domiciliary facility.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Regulations prescribed under section 7451(a) of this title shall provide that whenever an employee in a covered position is given a new duty assignment which is a promotion, the rate of basic pay of that employee shall be increased at least one step increment in that employee's grade.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A nurse serving in a head nurse position shall while so serving receive basic pay at a rate two step increments above the rate that would otherwise be applicable to the nurse. If such a nurse is in the highest or next-to-highest step for that nurse's grade, the preceding sentence shall be applied by extrapolation to create additional steps only for the purposes of this paragraph. The limitation in section 7451(c)(1) of this title shall not apply with respect to increased basic pay under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An employee in a covered position who is promoted to the next higher grade shall be paid in that grade at a step having a rate of basic pay that is greater than the rate of basic pay applicable to the employee in a covered position on the day before the effective date of the promotion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Under regulations which the Secretary prescribes for the administration of this section, the director of a Department health-care facility (A) shall pay a cash bonus (in an amount to be determined by the director not to exceed $2,000) to an employee in a covered position at that facility who becomes certified in a specialty recognized by the Department, and (B) may provide such a bonus to an employee in <!-- PDFPage:677 -->such a position who has demonstrated both exemplary job performance and exemplary job achievement. The authority of the Secretary under this subsection is in addition to any other authority of the Secretary to provide job performance incentives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall include in the annual report under section 7451(g) of this title a discussion of the use during the period covered by the report of the payment of bonuses under this subsection and other job performance incentives available to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Secretary shall provide (in regulations prescribed for the administration of this section) that the director of a Department health-care facility, in making a new appointment of a person under section 7401(1) of this title as an employee in a covered position for employment at that facility, may make that appointment at a rate of pay described in paragraph (3) without being subject to a requirement for prior approval at any higher level of authority within the Department in any case in which the director determines that it is necessary to do so in order to obtain the services of employees in covered positions in cases in which vacancies exist at that health-care facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such a determination may be made by the director of a health-care facility only in order to recruit employees in covered positions with specialized skills, especially employees with skills which are especially difficult or demanding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A rate of pay referred to in paragraph (1) is a rate of basic pay in excess of the minimum rate of basic pay applicable to the grade in which the appointment is made (but not in excess of the maximum rate of basic pay for that grade).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Whenever the director of a health-care facility makes an appointment described in paragraph (1) without prior approval at a higher level of authority within the Department, the director shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) state in a document the reasons for employing the employee in a covered position at a rate of pay in excess of the minimum rate of basic pay applicable to the grade in which the employee is appointed (and retain that document on file); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the first budget documents submitted to the Secretary by the director after the employee is employed, include documentation for the need for such increased rates of basic pay described in clause (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Whenever the director of a health-care facility makes an appointment described in paragraph (1) on the basis of a determination described in paragraph (2), the covered employee appointed may continue to receive pay at a rate higher than that which would otherwise be applicable to that employee only so long as the employee continues to serve in a position requiring the specialized skills with respect to which the determination was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Whenever the director of a health-care facility makes an appointment described in subsection (c)(1), the director may (without a regard to any requirement for prior approval at any higher level of authority within the Department) increase the rate of pay of other employees in the same covered position at that facility who are in the grade in which the appointment is made and are serving in a position requiring the specialized skills with respect to which the determination under subsection (c)(2) concerning the appointment was made. Any such increase shall continue in effect with respect to any employee only so long as the employee continues to serve in such a position.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) An employee in a covered position employed under section 7401(1) of this title who (without a break in employment) transfers from one Department health-care facility to another may not be reduced in grade or step within grade (except pursuant to a disciplinary action otherwise authorized by law) if the duties of the position to which the employee transfers are similar to the duties of the position from which the employee transferred. The rate of basic pay of such employee shall be established at the new health-care facility in a manner consistent with the practices at that facility for an employee of that grade and step, except that in the case of an employee whose transfer (other than pursuant to a disciplinary action otherwise authorized by law) to another health-care facility is at the request of the Secretary, the Secretary may provide that for at least the first year following such transfer the employee shall be paid at a rate of basic pay up to the rate applicable to such employee before the transfer, if the Secretary determines that such rate of pay is necessary to fill the position. Whenever the Secretary exercises the authority under the preceding sentence relating to the rate of basic pay of a transferred employee, the Secretary shall, in the next annual report required under section 7451(g) of this title, provide justification for doing so.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) In this section, the term &ldquo;covered position&rdquo; has the meaning given that term in section 7451 of this title.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In addition to the rate of basic pay provided for nurses, a nurse shall receive additional pay as provided by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A nurse performing service on a tour of duty, any part of which is within the period commencing at 6 postmeridian and ending at 6 antemeridian, shall receive additional pay for each hour of service on such tour at a rate equal to 10 percent of the nurse's hourly rate of basic pay if at least four hours of such tour fall between 6 postmeridian and 6 antemeridian. When less than four hours of such tour fall between 6 postmeridian and 6 antemeridian, the nurse shall be paid the differential for each hour of service performed between those hours.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A nurse performing service on a tour of duty, any part of which is within the period commencing at midnight Friday and ending at midnight Sunday, shall receive additional pay for each hour of service on such tour at a rate equal to 25 percent of such nurse's hourly rate of basic pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A nurse performing service on a holiday designated by Federal statute or Executive order shall receive for each hour of such service the nurse's hourly rate of basic pay, plus additional pay at a rate equal to such hourly rate of basic pay, for that holiday service, including overtime service. Any service required to be performed by a nurse on such a designated holiday shall be deemed to be a minimum of two hours in duration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) A nurse performing officially ordered or approved hours of service in excess of 40 hours in an administrative workweek, or in excess of eight hours in a day, shall receive overtime pay for each hour of such additional service. The overtime rates shall be one and one-half times such nurse's hourly rate of basic pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this subsection, overtime must be of at least 15 minutes duration in a day to be creditable for overtime pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Compensatory time off in lieu of pay for service performed under the provisions of this subsection shall not be permitted, except as voluntarily requested in writing by the nurse in question.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any excess service performed under this subsection on a day when service was not scheduled for such nurse, or for which such nurse is required to return to the nurse's place of employment, shall be deemed to be a minimum of two hours in duration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For the purposes of this subsection, the period of a nurse's officially ordered or approved travel away from such nurse's duty station may not be considered to be hours of service unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such travel occurs during such nurse's tour of duty; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such travel&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) is incident to travel that involves the performance of services while traveling,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) is carried out under arduous conditions as determined by the Secretary, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) results from an event which could not be scheduled or controlled administratively.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) For the purpose of computing the additional pay provided by subsection (b), (c), (d), or (e), a nurse's hourly rate of basic pay shall be derived by dividing such nurse's annual rate of basic pay by 2,080.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) When a nurse is entitled to two or more forms of additional pay under subsection (b), (c), (d), or (e) for the same period of service, the amounts of such additional pay shall be computed separately on the basis of such nurse's hourly rate of basic pay, except that no overtime pay as provided in subsection (e) shall be payable for overtime service performed on a holiday designated by Federal statute or Executive order in addition to pay received under subsection (d) for such service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) A nurse who is officially scheduled to be on call outside such nurse's regular hours or on a holiday designated by Federal statute or Executive order shall be paid for each hour of such on-call duty, except for such time as such nurse may be called back to work, at a rate equal to 10 percent of the hourly rate for excess service as provided in subsection (e).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Any additional pay paid pursuant to this section shall not be considered as basic pay for the purposes of the following provisions of title 5 (and any other provision of law relating to benefits based on basic pay):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Subchapter VI of chapter 55.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Section 5595.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Chapters 81, 83, 84, and 87.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law and subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary may increase the rates of additional pay authorized under subsections (b) through (h) if the Secretary determines that it is necessary to do so in order to obtain or retain the services of nurses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An increase under paragraph (1) in rates of additional pay&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may be made at any specific Department health-care facility in order to provide nurses, or any category of nurses, at such facility additional pay in an amount competitive with, but not exceeding, the amount of the same type of pay that is paid to the same category of nurses at non-Federal health-care facilities in the same geographic area as such Department health-care facility (based upon a reasonably representative sampling of such non-Federal facilities); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may be made on a nationwide, local, or other geographic basis if the Secretary finds that such an increase is justified on the basis of a review of the need for such increase (based upon a reasonably representative sampling of <!-- PDFPage:679 -->non-Federal health-care facilities in the geographic area involved).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A registered nurse entering into an agreement under this section shall agree to remain employed by the Department as a registered nurse for a period of time to be specified in the agreement and to serve during that period in a specific health-care facility that is designated by the Secretary as a health-care facility with a significant shortage of registered nurses in that nurse's clinical service. Such period may not be less than two years or more than four years. Such employment during such period may be on a full-time basis or a part-time basis, as specified in the agreement. Part-time employment as specified in such an agreement may not be less than half-time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary shall pay to any nurse entering into an agreement under this section bonus pay in an amount specified in the agreement. The amount of such bonus pay may not exceed&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of a bonus paid under this section shall not be considered to be basic pay for the purposes of sections 5551, 5552, and 5595 of title 5, chapters 81, 83, 84, and 87 of such title, or any other provision of law creating an entitlement to benefits based on basic pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) At least once each year the Secretary, upon the recommendation of the Under Secretary for Health, shall determine the specific health-care facilities and clinical services, if any, as to which there are significant problems with respect to the recruitment and retention of registered nurses. Upon making any such determination, the Secretary shall promptly notify the Committees on Veterans&rsquo; Affairs of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the determination and the basis for the determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary may enter into agreements under this section with individuals in a health profession other than nursing (and other than a <!-- PDFPage:682 -->health profession for which special pay may be provided under subchapter III) if the Secretary determines that there are significant problems with respect to recruitment and retention of employees in that health profession. The Secretary's authority to enter into any such agreement under this section, and such agreement, shall be subject to the provisions of this section in the same manner as are the authority to enter into an agreement under this section with a registered nurse and such an agreement.</p>

If the period actually served is less than two years, the amount to be refunded is the entire amount paid to the individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An individual shall not be required to make a refund under paragraph (1) of this subsection if the Secretary determines, in accordance with regulations prescribed under subsection (h) of this section, that the individual's failure to perform services for the period of obligated service is due to circumstances (not including separation for cause) beyond the control of the individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An obligation to refund any portion of a bonus payment under this subsection is, for all purposes, a debt owed to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The provisions of this subsection and the specific amounts that the individual could be required to refund shall be disclosed to the individual at the time the agreement is entered into and shall be clearly set forth in the contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Disciplinary Appeals Boards appointed under section 7464 of this title shall have exclusive jurisdiction to review any case&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) which arises out of (or which includes) a question of professional conduct or competence of a section 7401(1) employee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in which a major adverse action was taken.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The board shall include in its record of decision in any mixed case a statement of the board's exclusive jurisdiction under this subsection and the basis for such exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of paragraph (2), a mixed case is a case that includes both a major adverse action arising out of a question of professional conduct or competence and an adverse action which is not a major adverse action or which does not arise out of a question of professional conduct or competence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In any case in which charges are brought against a section 7401(1) employee which arises out of, or includes, a question of professional conduct or competence which could result in a major adverse action, the employee is entitled to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) At least 30 days advance written notice from the Under Secretary for Health or other charging official specifically stating the basis for each charge, the adverse actions that could be taken if the charges are sustained, and a statement of any specific law, regulation, policy, procedure, practice, or other specific instruction that has been violated with respect to each charge, except that the requirement for notification in advance may be waived if there is reasonable cause to believe that the employee has committed a crime for which the employee may be imprisoned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A reasonable time, but not less than seven days, to present an answer orally and in writing to the Under Secretary for Health or other deciding official, who shall be an official higher in rank than the charging official, and to submit affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the answer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case described in paragraph (1), the employee is entitled to be represented by an attorney or other representative of the employee's choice at all stages of the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If a proposed adverse action covered by this section is not withdrawn, the deciding official shall render a decision in writing within 21 days of receipt by the deciding official of the employee's answer. The decision shall include a statement of the specific reasons for the decision with respect to each charge. If a major adverse action is imposed, the decision shall state whether any of the charges sustained arose out of a question of professional conduct or competence. If any of the charges are sustained, the notice of the decision to the employee shall include notice of the employee's rights of appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding the 21-day period specified in subparagraph (A), a proposed adverse action may be held in abeyance if the employee requests, and the deciding official agrees, that the employee shall seek counseling or treatment for a condition covered under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Any such abeyance of a proposed action may not extend for more than one year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Secretary may require that any answer and submission under paragraph (1)(B) be submitted so as to be received within 30 days of the date of the written notice of the charges, except that the Secretary shall allow the granting of extensions for good cause shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall require that any appeal to a Disciplinary Appeals Board from a decision to impose a major adverse action shall be received within 30 days after the date of service of the written decision on the employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) When a Disciplinary Appeals Board convenes to consider an appeal in a case under this section, the board, before proceeding to consider the merits of the appeal, shall determine whether the case is properly before it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon hearing such an appeal, the board shall, with respect to each charge appealed to the board, sustain the charge, dismiss the charge, or sustain the charge in part and dismiss the charge in part. If the deciding official is sustained (in whole or in part) with respect to any such charge, the board shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) approve the action as imposed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) approve the action with modification, reduction, or exception; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) reverse the action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A board shall afford an employee appealing an adverse action under this section an opportunity for an oral hearing. If such a hearing is held, the board shall provide the employee with a transcript of the hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The board shall render a decision in any case within 45 days of completion of the hearing, if there is a hearing, and in any event no later than 120 days after the appeal commenced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) After resolving any question as to whether a matter involves professional conduct or competence, the Secretary shall cause to be executed the decision of the Disciplinary Ap<!-- PDFPage:684 -->peals Board in a timely manner and in any event in not more than 90 days after the decision of the Board is received by the Secretary. Pursuant to the board's decision, the Secretary may order reinstatement, award back pay, and provide such other remedies as the board found appropriate relating directly to the proposed action, including expungement of records relating to the action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary finds a decision of the board to be clearly contrary to the evidence or unlawful, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reverse the decision of the board, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) vacate the decision of the board and remand the matter to the Board for further consideration.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Secretary finds the decision of the board (while not clearly contrary to the evidence or unlawful) to be not justified by the nature of the charges, the Secretary may mitigate the adverse action imposed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary's execution of a board's decision shall be the final administrative action in the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary may designate an employee of the Department to represent management in any case before a Disciplinary Appeals Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) A section 7401(1) employee adversely affected by a final order or decision of a Disciplinary Appeals Board (as reviewed by the Secretary) may obtain judicial review of the order or decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which judicial review is sought under this subsection, the court shall review the record and hold unlawful and set aside any agency action, finding, or conclusion found to be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary shall from time to time appoint boards to hear appeals of major adverse actions described in section 7462 of this title. Such boards shall be known as Disciplinary Appeals Boards. Each board shall consist of three employees of the Department, each of whom shall be of the same grade as, or be senior in grade to, the employee who is appealing an adverse action. At least two of the members of each board shall be employed in the same category of position as the employee who is appealing the adverse action. Members of a board shall be appointed from individuals on the panel established under subsection (d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In appointing a board for any case, the Secretary shall designate one of the members to be chairman and one of the members to be secretary of the board, each of whom shall have authority to administer oaths.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Appointment of boards, and the proceedings of such boards, shall be carried out under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. A verbatim record shall be maintained of board hearings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Notwithstanding sections 5701 and 7332 of this title, the chairman of a board, upon request of an employee whose case is under consideration by the board (or a representative of that employee) may, in connection with the considerations of the board, review records or information covered by those sections and may authorize the disclosure of such records or information to that employee (or representative) to the extent the board considers appropriate for purposes of the proceedings of the board in that case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any such case the board chairman may direct that measures be taken to protect the personal privacy of individuals whose records are involved. Any person who uses or discloses a record or information covered by this subsection for any purpose other than in connection with the proceedings of the board shall be fined not more than $5,000 in the case of a first offense and not more than $20,000 in the case of a subsequent offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Secretary shall provide for the periodic designation of employees of the Department who are qualified to serve on Disciplinary Appeals Boards. Those employees shall constitute the panel from which board members in a case are appointed. The Secretary shall provide (without charge) a list of the names of employees on the panel to any person requesting such list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall announce periodically, and not less often than annually, that the roster of employees on the panel is available as described in paragraph (1). Such announcement shall be made at Department medical facilities and through publication in the Federal Register. Notice of a name being on the list must be provided at least 30 days before the individual selected may serve on a Board or as a grievance examiner. Employees, employee organizations, and other interested parties may submit comments to the Secretary concerning the suitability for service on the panel of any employee whose name is on the list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall provide training in the functions and duties of Disciplinary Appeals Boards and grievance procedures under section 7463 of this title for employees selected to be on the panel.</p>
