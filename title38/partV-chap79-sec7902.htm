<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Secretary may provide financial assistance under this section to an individual for up to five years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may waive the limitation under subparagraph (A) if the Secretary determines that such a waiver is appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Service Agreement for Scholarship Recipients</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To receive financial assistance under this section an individual shall enter into an agreement to accept and continue employment in the Department for the period of obligated service determined under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this subsection, the period of obligated service for a recipient of financial assistance under this section shall be the period determined by the Secretary as being appropriate to obtain adequate service in exchange for the financial assistance and otherwise to achieve the goals set forth in section 7901(a) of this title. In no event may the period of service required of a recipient be less than the period equal to the total period of pursuit of a degree for which the Secretary agrees to provide the recipient with financial assistance under this section. The period of obligated service is in addition to any other period for which the recipient is obligated to serve on active duty or in the civil service, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An agreement entered into under this section by a person pursuing a doctoral degree shall include terms that provide the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) That the period of obligated service begins on a date after the award of the degree that is determined under the regulations prescribed under section 7906 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) That the individual will maintain satisfactory academic progress, as determined in accordance with those regulations, and that failure to maintain such progress constitutes grounds for termination of the financial assistance for the individual under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Amount of Assistance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The amount of the financial assistance provided for an individual under this section shall be the amount determined by the Secretary as being necessary to pay&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $1,500 to the individual each month (including a month between academic semesters or terms leading to the degree for which such assistance is provided or during which the individual is not enrolled in a course of education but is pursuing independent research leading to such degree) for books, laboratory expenses, and expenses of room and board.</p>

A discharge in bankruptcy under title 11 does not discharge a person from such debt if the discharge order is entered less than five years after the date of the termination of the agreement or contract on which the debt is based.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Waiver or Suspension of Compliance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall prescribe regulations providing for the waiver or suspension of any obligation of an individual for service or payment under this section (or an agreement under this section) whenever noncompliance by the individual is due to circumstances beyond the control of the individual or whenever the Secretary determines that the waiver or suspension of compliance is in the best interest of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Internships</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may offer a compensated internship to an individual for whom financial assistance is provided under this section during a period between academic semesters or terms leading to the degree for which such assistance is provided.
