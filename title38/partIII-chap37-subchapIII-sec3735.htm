Such sale or lease or donation shall be for such consideration as the Secretary determines is in the best interests of homeless veterans and the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may enter into an agreement under paragraph (1) of this subsection only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary determines that such an action will not adversely affect the ability of the Department&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to fulfill its statutory missions with respect to the Department loan guaranty program and the short- and long-term solvency of the Veterans Housing Benefit Program Fund under this chapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to carry out other functions and administer other programs authorized by law;</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary determines that there is no significant likelihood of the property being sold for a price sufficient to reduce the liability of the Department or the veteran who defaulted on the loan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) An approved entity that leases a property from the Secretary under this section shall be responsible for the payment of any taxes, utilities, liability insurance, and other maintenance charges or similar charges that apply to the property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any agreement, deed, or other instrument executed by the Secretary under this subsection shall be on such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines to be appropriate and necessary to carry out the purpose of such agreement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In making a loan under this subsection, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall establish credit standards to be used for this purpose;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may, pursuant to section 3733(a)(6) of this title, provide that the loan will bear interest at a rate below the rate that prevails for similar loans in the market in which the loan is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) may waive the collection of a fee under section 3729 of this title in any case in which the Secretary determines that such a waiver would be appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary may not enter into agreements under subsection (a) after December 31, 1999.</p>
