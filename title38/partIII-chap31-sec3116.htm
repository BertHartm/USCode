Such payments may not exceed the direct expenses incurred by such employers in providing such on-job training or employment opportunity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which a veteran described in paragraph (1) of this subsection participates in on-job training described in such paragraph that satisfies the criteria for payment of a training assistance allowance under section 3687 of this title, such veteran shall, to the extent that such veteran has remaining eligibility for and entitlement to such allowance, be paid such allowance.</p>
