<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to evaluate the advisability of the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to monitor any purchase, construction, or improvements carried out using the proceeds of the loan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) That the tribal organization has established standards and procedures that apply to the foreclosure of the interest conveyed by a Native American veteran pursuant to subparagraph (B), including&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) That the tribal organization agrees to such other terms and conditions with respect to the making of direct loans to Native American veterans under the jurisdiction of the tribal organization as the Secretary may require in order to ensure that the pilot program established under this subchapter is implemented in a responsible and prudent manner.</p>
