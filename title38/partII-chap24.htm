<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary is authorized to make all rules and regulations which are necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this chapter, and may designate those cemeteries which are considered to be national cemeteries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In conjunction with the development and administration of cemeteries for which the Secretary is responsible, the Secretary shall provide all necessary facilities including, as necessary, superintendents&rsquo; lodges, chapels, crypts, mausoleums, and columbaria.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), each grave in a national cemetery shall be marked with an appropriate marker. Such marker shall bear the name of the person buried, the number of the grave, and such other information as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The grave markers referred to in paragraph (1) shall be upright for interments that occur on or after January 1, 1987, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of any cemetery scheduled to be closed by September 30, 1991, as indicated in the documents submitted by the Administrator of Veterans&rsquo; Affairs to the Congress in justification for the amounts included for Veterans&rsquo; Administration programs in the President's Budget for fiscal year 1987, the Secretary may provide for flat grave markers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of any cemetery with a section which has flat markers on October 28, 1986, the Secretary may continue to provide for flat grave markers in such section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the case of any cemetery located on the grounds of or adjacent to a Department health-care facility, the Secretary may provide for flat grave markers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) in the case of grave sites of cremated remains that are interred in the ground, the Secretary may provide for flat grave markers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) There shall be kept in each national cemetery, and at the main office of the Department, a register of burials in each cemetery setting forth the name of each person buried in the cemetery, the number of the grave in which the veteran is buried, and such other information as the Secretary by regulation may prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) In carrying out the Secretary's responsibilities under this chapter, the Secretary may contract with responsible persons, firms, or corporations for the care and maintenance of such cemeteries under the Secretary's jurisdiction as the Secretary shall choose, under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) The Secretary is authorized to convey to any State, or political subdivision thereof, in which any national cemetery is located, all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to any Government owned or controlled approach road to such cemetery if, prior to the delivery of any instrument of conveyance, the State or political subdivision to which such conveyance is to be made notifies the Secretary in writing of its willingness to accept and maintain the road included in such conveyance. Upon the execution and delivery of such a conveyance, the jurisdiction of the United States over the road conveyed shall cease and thereafter vest in the State or political subdivision concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may, to the extent of appropriated funds available for such purpose, make a contribution to local authorities for the construction of road improvements or traffic controls or other devices on land adjacent to a national cemetery if the Secretary determines that such a contribution is essential to ensure safe ingress to or egress from the cemetery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may at such time as the Secretary deems desirable, relinquish to the State in which any cemetery, monument, or memorial under the Secretary's jurisdiction is located, such portion of legislative jurisdiction over the lands involved as is necessary to establish concurrent jurisdiction between the Federal Government and the State concerned. Such partial relinquishment of jurisdiction under the authority of this subsection may be made by filing with the Governor of the State involved a notice of such relinquishment and shall take effect upon acceptance thereof by the State in such manner as its laws may prescribe.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may make grants to any State to assist such State in establishing, expanding, or improving veterans&rsquo; cemeteries owned by such State. Any such grant may be made only upon submission of an application to the Secretary in such form and manner, and containing such information, as the Secretary may require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) There is authorized to be appropriated $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1980 and for each of the four succeeding fiscal years, and such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 1985 and for each of the fourteen succeeding fiscal years, for the purpose of making grants under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Grants under this section shall be subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The amount of any grant under this section may not exceed an amount equal to 50 percent of the total of the value of the land to be acquired or dedicated for the cemetery and the cost of the improvements to be made on such land, with the remaining amount to be contributed by the State receiving the grant.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:291 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If at the time of a grant under this section the State receiving the grant dedicates for the purposes of the cemetery involved land already owned by the State, the value of such land may be considered in determining the amount of the State's contribution under paragraph (1) of this subsection, but the value of such land may not be used for more than an amount equal to 50 percent of the amount of such contribution and may not be used as part of such State's contribution for any subsequent grant under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If a State that has received a grant under this section to establish, expand, or improve a veterans&rsquo; cemetery ceases to own such cemetery, ceases to operate such cemetery as a veterans&rsquo; cemetery, or uses any part of the funds provided through such grant for a purpose other than that for which the grant was made, the United States shall be entitled to recover from such State the total of all grants made under this section to such State in connection with such cemetery.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) In addition to the conditions specified in subsection (b) of this section, any grant to a State under this section to assist such State in establishing a veterans&rsquo; cemetery shall be made on the condition that such cemetery shall conform to such standards and guidelines relating to site selection, planning, and construction as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe. In prescribing regulations for the purposes of the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall take into account the standards and guidelines for site selection, planning, and construction that are applicable to cemeteries in the National Cemetery System, including those provided in subsections (b), (c), and (d) of section 2404 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may by regulation prescribe such additional terms and conditions for grants under this section as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) In addition to the conditions specified in subsections (b) and (c), any grant made on or after the date of the enactment of this subsection to a State under this section to assist such State in establishing, expanding, or improving a veterans&rsquo; cemetery shall be made on the condition described in paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the condition described in this paragraph is that, after the date of the receipt of the grant, such State prohibit the interment or memorialization in that cemetery of a person described in section 2411(b) of this title, subject to the receipt of notice described in subsection (a)(2) of such section, except that for purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such notice shall be furnished to an appropriate official of such State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a finding described in subsection (b)(3) of such section shall be made by an appropriate official of such State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Sums appropriated under subsection (a) of this section shall remain available until the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year for which they are appropriated. If all funds from a grant under this section have not been utilized by a State for the purpose for which the grant was made within three years after such grant is made, the United States shall be entitled to recover any such unused grant funds from such State.</p>
