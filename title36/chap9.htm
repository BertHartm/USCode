<h4 class="note-head">Proc. No. 4411. The Bicentennial Year</h4>
<p class="note-body">Proc. No. 4411, Dec. 31, 1975, 41 F.R. 1035, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">In the year 1776, the people of our land dedicated themselves in word and deed to the principles of liberty, equality, individual dignity, and representative government. It was a hectic but heroic beginning of a process which led to the creation of a great Republic symbolizing then, as it does today, the hope of the future.</p>
<p class="note-body">The year 1776 was a year of revolution, not merely in the rejection of colonial rule, but in the thoughtful, eloquent, and enduring expression of a government to foster and perpetuate the development of a free and independent people.</p>
<p class="note-body">Now, two hundred years later, we have settled our continent and turned our vision to the limits of the universe. We are the richest nation in the world&mdash;rich in our resources, rich in our creativity, rich in our strength, and rich in our people&mdash;from our Native Americans to those who have come from every country on earth to share in the hope, the work, and the spirit of our Republic.</p>
<p class="note-body">The challenges faced by our forebears were not only to their physical capabilities but also to their faith in the future. Their response to these challenges affirmed their deep belief that by their actions they could create a better world for themselves and those that would follow. As we enter America's third century, let us emulate in word and deed, their resolve and vision.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-six as The Bicentennial Year. Let 1976 be a year of reflection, a year of sharing, and foremost, a year of achievement.</p>
<p class="note-body">I urge all Americans to reflect, from time to time during this Bicentennial Year, on the historic events of our past, on the heroic deeds of those whose legacy we now enjoy, and on the compelling visions of those who helped shape our constitutional government.</p>
<p class="note-body">I call upon educators, clergy and labor, business and community leaders, as well as those in the communications media, to review our history and publicize the shaping events, people, and ideas of our historic beginnings.</p>
<p class="note-body">I call upon every man, woman, and child to celebrate the diversity of tradition, culture and heritage that reflects our people and our patrimony. Let each of us resolve to cherish and protect what we have achieved in the United States of America and to build upon it in the years ahead, not by words alone, but by actions which bespeak a continuing commitment to a heritage of individual initiative, creativity, and liberty.</p>
<p class="note-body">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundredth.</p>
<p class="presidential-signature">Gerald R. Ford.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Proc. No. 4934. Armed Forces Day</h4>
<p class="note-body">Proc. No. 4934, Apr. 16, 1982, 47 F.R. 16767, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Each year we Americans set aside one day to honor the brave and dedicated men and women of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard.</p>
<p class="note-body">They serve our nation with dignity, courage, and pride in duty stations throughout the world. The peace we enjoy today reminds us of their important role.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States of America and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, continuing the precedent of my seven immediate predecessors in this Office, do hereby proclaim the third Saturday of each May as Armed Forces Day.</p>
<p class="note-body">I direct the Secretary of Defense on behalf of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps, and the Secretary of Transportation on behalf of the Coast Guard, to plan for appropriate observances each year, with the Secretary of Defense responsible for soliciting the participation and cooperation of civil authorities and private citizens.</p>
<p class="note-body">I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to provide for the observance of Armed Forces Day within their jurisdiction each year in an appropriate manner designed to increase public understanding and appreciation of the Armed Forces of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">I also invite national and local veterans, civic and other organizations to join in the observance of Armed Forces Day each year.</p>
<p class="note-body">I call upon all Americans not only to display the flag of the United States at their homes on Armed Forces Day, but also to learn about our system of defense, and about the men and women who sustain it, by attending and participating in the local observances of the day.</p>
<p class="note-body">Proclamation 4571 of May 15, 1978, is hereby superseded.</p>
<p class="note-body">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 16th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.</p>
