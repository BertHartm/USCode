The number, qualifications, and terms of office of members of the national council shall be prescribed by the constitution, except that they shall be citizens of the United States. The constitution may prescribe the number of members of the national council necessary to constitute a quorum, which number may be less than a majority of the whole number. The affairs of the corporation between meetings of the national council shall be managed by a board of directors, except that the bylaws may provide for an executive committee to exercise the powers of the board of directors in the interim between its meetings, and for other committees to operate under the general supervision of the board of directors. The number, qualifications, and terms of office of members of the board of directors shall be prescribed by the constitution. The constitution may prescribe the number of members of the board of directors necessary to constitute a quorum which number shall not be less than twenty, or two-fifths of the whole number. The board of directors, to the extent provided in the constitution and bylaws, shall have the powers of the national council, in the interim between its meetings.
