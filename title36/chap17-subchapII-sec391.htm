<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) National governing body; application; notice and hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any sport which is included on the program of the Olympic Games or the Pan-American Games, the Corporation is authorized to recognize as a national governing body an amateur sports organization which files an application and is eligible for such recognition, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section. The Corporation shall recognize only one national governing body for each sport for which an application is made and approved. Prior to the recognition of a national governing body under the authority granted under this subchapter and in accordance with the procedures and requirements of this section, the Corporation shall hold a hearing open to the public on the application for such recognition. The Corporation shall publish notice of the time, place, and nature of the hearing. Publication shall be made in a regular issue of the Corporation's principal publication at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, prior to the date of the hearing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No amateur sports organization is eligible to be recognized or is eligible to continue to be recognized as a national governing body unless it&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) agrees to submit, upon demand of the Corporation, to binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the commercial rules of the American Arbitration Association in any controversy involving its recognition as a national governing body, as provided for in section 395 of this title, or involving the opportunity of any amateur athlete, coach, trainer, manager, administrator or official to participate in amateur athletic competition, as provided for in the Corporation's constitution and bylaws;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) demonstrates that it is autonomous in the governance of its sport, in that it independently determines and controls all matters central to such governance, does not delegate such determination and control, and is free from outside restraint, and demonstrates that it is a member of no more than one international sports federation which governs a sport included on the program of the Olympic Games or the Pan-American Games;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) demonstrates that its membership is open to any individual who is an amateur athlete, coach, trainer, manager, administrator, or official active in the sport for which recognition is sought, or to any amateur sports organization which conducts programs in the sport for which recognition is sought, or to both;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) is governed by a board of directors or other such governing board whose members are selected without regard to race, color, reli<!-- PDFPage:90 -->gion, national origin or sex, except that, in sports where there are separate male and female programs, it provides for reasonable representation of both males and females on such board of directors or other such governing board;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) demonstrates that its board of directors or other such governing board includes among its voting members individuals who are actively engaged in amateur athletic competition in the sport for which recognition is sought or who have represented the United States in international amateur athletic competition in the sport for which recognition is sought within the preceding 10 years, and that the membership and voting power held by such individuals is not less than 20 percent of such membership and voting power held in that board of directors or other such governing board;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) provides for reasonable direct representation on its board of directors or other such governing board for any amateur sports organization which, in the sport for which recognition is sought, conducts, on a level of proficiency appropriate for the selection of amateur athletes to represent the United States in international amateur athletic competition, a national program or regular national amateur athletic competition, and ensures that such representation shall reflect the nature, scope, quality, and strength of the programs and competitions of such amateur sports organization in relation to all other such programs and competitions in such sport in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) demonstrates that none of its officers are also officers of any other amateur sports organization which is recognized as a national governing body;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) provides procedures for the prompt and equitable resolution of grievances of its members;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) does not have eligibility criteria relating to amateur status which are more restrictive than those of the appropriate international sports federation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) demonstrates, if it is an amateur sports organization seeking recognition as a national governing body, that it is prepared to meet the obligations imposed on a national governing body under section 392 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Period within which to comply with eligibility requirements; suspension or revocation of recognition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), any amateur sports organization which on November 8, 1978, is recognized by the Corporation to represent a particular sport shall be considered to be the national governing body for that sport. Such an organization is exempt for a period of 2 years from November 8, 1978, from meeting the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, and during the 2-year period shall take the necessary actions to meet such requirements if it desires to retain its recognition. After the expiration of the 2-year period, such an organization shall continue as the national governing body for that sport unless the Corporation determines that such organization is not in compliance with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, in which event the Corporation shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) suspend the recognition of such national governing body;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) revoke the recognition of such national governing body; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) extend the 2-year period for not longer than 1 year, if the national governing body has proven by clear and convincing evidence that, through no fault of its own, it needs additional time to comply with such requirements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If, at the end of the extension period referred to in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, the national governing body has not complied with such requirements, the Corporation shall revoke the recognition of such national governing body. Any such national governing body aggrieved by the Corporation's determination under this subsection may submit a demand for arbitration in accordance with section 395(c) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), the Corporation may suspend or revoke the recognition of a national governing body during the 2-year period if such suspension or revocation is for the same reason as the Corporation could have revoked or suspended such national governing body prior to November 8, 1978.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Recommendation of national governing body as United States representative to appropriate international sports federation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 61 days after recognizing an amateur sports organization as a national governing body, in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, the Corporation shall recommend and support in any appropriate manner such national governing body to the appropriate international sports federation as the representative of the United States for that sport.</p>
