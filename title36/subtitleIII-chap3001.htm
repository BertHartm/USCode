<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The President shall appoint eight governors, one of whom the President shall designate to act as the principal officer of the corporation with the title and functions pro<!-- PDFPage:289 -->vided in the bylaws. The other governors appointed by the President shall be officials of departments and agencies of the United States Government, whose positions and interests qualify them to contribute to carrying out the programs and purposes of the corporation. At least one, but not more than three, of those officials shall be selected from the Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The chapters shall elect 30 governors at the national convention under procedures for nomination and election that ensure equitable representation of all chapters, with regard to geographical considerations, the size of the chapters, and the size of the populations served by the chapters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The board shall elect 12 governors as members-at-large. Those governors shall be individuals who are representative of the national interests that the corporation serves, and with which it is desirable that the corporation have close association.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) One-third of the members elected to the board shall be elected at each national convention, and take office at that time or as soon as practicable after the convention.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Term of Office and Vacancies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The term of office of each governor is 3 years. However, the term of office of a governor appointed by the President (except the principal officer of the corporation) expires if, before the end of the 3-year term, the governor retires from the official position held at the time of appointment as a governor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President shall fill as soon as practicable a vacancy in the office of the principal officer of the corporation or in the position of another governor appointed by the President. The board shall make a temporary appointment to fill a vacancy occurring in an elected position on the board. An individual appointed by the board to fill a vacancy serves until the next national convention.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) appoint and remove, or provide for the appointment and removal of, officers and employees of the corporation, except the principal officer of the corporation.</p>
