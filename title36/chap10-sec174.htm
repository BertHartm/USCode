<h4 class="note-head">Proc. No. 4064. Display of Flags at the Washington Monument</h4>
<p class="note-body">Proc. No. 4064, July 6, 1971, 36 F.R. 12967, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">The Washington Monument stands day and night as America's tribute to our first President. The fifty American flags that encircle the base of the Monument represent our fifty States and, at the same time, symbolize our enduring Federal Union.</p>
<p class="note-body">As this Nation's 200th year approaches, I believe that it would do all Americans well to remember the years of our first President and to recall the enduring ideals of our Nation.</p>
<p class="note-body">As an expression of our rededication to the ideals of America and in accordance with the joint resolution of Congress of June 22, 1942 (56 Stat. 377), as amended by the joint resolution of December 22, 1942, (56 Stat. 1074) [this section], which permits the flag to be displayed at night &ldquo;upon special occasions when it is desired to produce a patriotic effect,&rdquo; it is appropriate that our national colors henceforth be displayed day and night at the Washington Monument.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim that, effective July 4, 1971, the fifty flags of the United States of America displayed at the Washington Monument in the District of Columbia be flown at all times during the day and night, except when the weather is inclement.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rules and customs pertaining to the display of the flag as set forth in the joint resolution of June 22, 1942, as amended [section 173 et seq. of this title], are hereby modified accordingly.</p>
<p class="note-body">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.</p>
<p class="presidential-signature">Richard Nixon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Proc. No. 4131. Display of Flag at United States Customs Ports of Entry</h4>
<p class="note-body">Proc. No. 4131, May 5, 1972, 37 F.R. 9311, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">The flag of the United States should be one of the first things seen at our Customs ports of entry, both by American citizens returning from abroad and by travelers from other countries.</p>
<p class="note-body">As the symbol of our country and our freedoms, the national colors of the United States provide a welcome greeting of warm promise.</p>
<p class="note-body">Many people, however, enter our country at night when the flag is not flown, because of the nearly universal custom of displaying it only from sunrise to sunset.</p>
<p class="note-body">Authority exists to amend that custom. A Congressional joint resolution of June 22, 1942 (56 Stat. 377), as amended (36 U.S.C. 173&ndash;178), permits the flag to be displayed at night &ldquo;upon special occasions when it is desired to produce a patriotic effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">I believe it is appropriate that returning citizens and visitors from other countries be welcomed by our flag whether they arrive at their ports of entry by night or by day.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim that the flag of the United States of America shall hereafter be displayed at all times during the day and night, except when the weather is inclement, at United States Customs ports of entry which are continually open.</p>
<p class="note-body">The rules and customs pertaining to the display of the flag, as set forth in the joint resolution of June 22, 1942, as amended, are hereby modified accordingly.</p>
<p class="note-body">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.</p>
