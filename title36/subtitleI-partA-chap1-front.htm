<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) as a delegate to the Continental Congress, and to the Annapolis Convention of 1786, James Madison foresaw the need for a more effective national government and was a persuasive advocate for such a government at the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention of 1787;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) James Madison worked tirelessly and successfully at the Constitutional Convention to mold a national charter, the United States Constitution, that combined both energy and restraint, empowering the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary, within a framework of limited government, separated powers, and a system of federalism;</p>
