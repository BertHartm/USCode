<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) National governing body; application; notice and hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any sport which is included on the program of the Olympic Games or the Pan-American Games, the Corporation is authorized to recognize as a national governing body an amateur sports organization which files an application and is eligible for such recognition, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section. The Corporation shall recognize only one national governing body for each sport for which an application is made and approved. Prior to the recognition of a national governing body under the authority granted under this subchapter and in accordance with the procedures and requirements of this section, the Corporation shall hold a hearing open to the public on the application for such recognition. The Corporation shall publish notice of the time, place, and nature of the hearing. Publication shall be made in a regular issue of the Corporation's principal publication at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, prior to the date of the hearing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility requirements</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) agrees to submit, upon demand of the Corporation, to binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the commercial rules of the American Arbitration Association in any controversy involving its recognition as a national governing body, as provided for in section 395 of this title, or involving the opportunity of any amateur athlete, coach, trainer, manager, administrator or official to participate in amateur athletic competition, as provided for in the Corporation's constitution and bylaws;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) demonstrates that it is autonomous in the governance of its sport, in that it independently determines and controls all matters central to such governance, does not delegate such determination and control, and is free from outside restraint, and demonstrates that it is a member of no more than one international sports federation which governs a sport included on the program of the Olympic Games or the Pan-American Games;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) demonstrates that its membership is open to any individual who is an amateur athlete, coach, trainer, manager, administrator, or official active in the sport for which recognition is sought, or to any amateur sports organization which conducts programs in the sport for which recognition is sought, or to both;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) provides an equal opportunity to amateur athletes, coaches, trainers, managers, administrators, and officials to participate in amateur athletic competition, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, age, sex, or national origin, and with fair notice and opportunity for a hearing to any amateur athlete, coach, trainer, manager, administrator, or official before declaring such individual ineligible to participate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) is governed by a board of directors or other such governing board whose members are selected without regard to race, color, religion, national origin or sex, except that, in sports where there are separate male and female programs, it provides for reasonable representation of both males and females on such board of directors or other such governing board;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) demonstrates that its board of directors or other such governing board includes among its voting members individuals who are actively engaged in amateur athletic competition in the sport for which recognition is sought or who have represented the United States in international amateur athletic competition in the sport for which recognition is sought within the preceding 10 years, and that the membership and voting power held by such individuals is not less than 20 percent of such membership and voting power held in that board of directors or other such governing board;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) provides for reasonable direct representation on its board of directors or other such governing board for any amateur sports organization which, in the sport for which recognition is sought, conducts, on a level of proficiency appropriate for the selection of amateur athletes to represent the United States in international amateur athletic competition, a national program or regular national amateur athletic competition, and ensures that such representation shall reflect the nature, scope, quality, and strength of the programs and competitions of such amateur sports organization in relation to all other such programs and competitions in such sport in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) demonstrates that none of its officers are also officers of any other amateur sports organization which is recognized as a national governing body;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) provides procedures for the prompt and equitable resolution of grievances of its members;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) does not have eligibility criteria relating to amateur status which are more restrictive than those of the appropriate international sports federation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) demonstrates, if it is an amateur sports organization seeking recognition as a national governing body, that it is prepared to meet the obligations imposed on a national governing body under section 392 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Period within which to comply with eligibility requirements; suspension or revocation of recognition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), any amateur sports organization which on November 8, 1978, is recognized by the Corporation to represent a particular sport shall be considered to be the national governing body for that sport. Such an organization is exempt for a period of 2 years from November 8, 1978, from meeting the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, and during the 2-year period shall take the necessary actions to meet such requirements if it desires to retain its recognition. After the expiration of the 2-year period, such an organization shall continue as the national governing body for that sport unless the Corporation determines that such organization is not in compliance with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, in which event the Corporation shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) suspend the recognition of such national governing body;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) revoke the recognition of such national governing body; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) extend the 2-year period for not longer than 1 year, if the national governing body has proven by clear and convincing evidence that, through no fault of its own, it needs additional time to comply with such requirements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If, at the end of the extension period referred to in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, the national governing body has not complied with such requirements, the Corporation shall revoke the recognition of such national governing body. Any such national governing body aggrieved by the Corporation's determination under this subsection may submit a demand for arbitration in accordance with section 395(c) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), the Corporation may suspend or revoke the recognition of a national governing <!-- PDFPage:89 -->body during the 2-year period if such suspension or revocation is for the same reason as the Corporation could have revoked or suspended such national governing body prior to November 8, 1978.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Recommendation of national governing body as United States representative to appropriate international sports federation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 61 days after recognizing an amateur sports organization as a national governing body, in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, the Corporation shall recommend and support in any appropriate manner such national governing body to the appropriate international sports federation as the representative of the United States for that sport.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) If the Corporation places a national governing body on probation pursuant to this paragraph, it may extend the probationary period if <!-- PDFPage:91 -->the national governing body has proven by clear and convincing evidence that, through no fault of its own, it needs additional time to comply with such requirements.

If two or more organizations file applications for the same sport, such applications shall be considered in a single proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any application filed under this subsection shall be filed with the Corporation by registered mail.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the national governing body does not meet the criteria of section 391(b) or 392 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it more adequately meets the criteria of section 391(b) of this title, is capable of more adequately meeting the criteria of section 392 of this title, and provides or is capable of providing a more effective national program of competition, than the national governing body in the sport for which it seeks recognition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Within 30 days of the close of the hearing required under this subsection, the Corporation shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) revoke the recognition of the national governing body and declare a vacancy in the national governing body for that sport;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) revoke the recognition of the national governing body and recognize the applicant as the national governing body; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) decide to place the national governing body on probation of not to exceed 180 days, pending the compliance of the national governing body, if such national governing body would have retained recognition except for a minor deficiency in one of the requirements of section 391(b) or 392 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the national governing body does not comply within the prescribed time period, the Corporation shall revoke the recognition of the national governing body and either recognize the applicant as the national governing body, or declare a vacancy in the national governing body for that sport.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Within 61 days after recognizing an amateur sports organization as a national governing body, in accordance with this subsection, the Corporation shall recommend and support in any appropriate manner such national governing body to the appropriate international sports federation as the representative of the United States for that sport.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Arbitration of Corporation determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The right to review by any party aggrieved by a determination of the Corporation under the requirements of this section or section 391(c) of this title shall be to any regional office of the American Arbitration Association. Such demand for arbitration shall be submitted within 30 days of the determination of the Corporation. Upon receipt of such a demand for arbitration, the Association shall serve notice on the parties to the arbitration and on the Corporation, and shall immediately proceed with arbitration according to the commercial rules of the Association in effect at the time of the filing of the demand, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the arbitration panel shall consist of not less than three arbitrators, unless the parties to the proceeding mutually agree to a lesser number;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the arbitration hearing shall take place at a site selected by the Association, unless the parties to the proceeding mutually agree to the use of another site; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The arbitrators in any arbitration are empowered to settle any dispute arising under the provisions of this chapter prior to making a final award, if mutually agreed to by the parties to the proceeding and achieved in a manner not inconsistent with the constitution and bylaws of the Corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each contesting party may be represented by counsel or by any other duly authorized representative at the arbitration proceeding. The parties may offer any evidence which they desire and shall produce any additional evidence as the arbitrators believe necessary to an understanding and determination of the dispute. The arbitrators shall be the sole judges of the relevancy and materiality of the evidence offered. Conformity to legal rules of evidence shall not be necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) All decisions by the arbitrators shall be by majority vote unless the concurrence of all is expressly required by the contesting parties.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:92 --><p class="statutory-body">(5) Final decision of the arbitrators shall be binding upon the involved parties, if such award is not inconsistent with the constitution and bylaws of the Corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The hearings may be reopened, by the arbitrators upon their own motion or upon the motion of any contesting party, at any time before a final decision is made, except that, if any contesting party makes such a motion, all parties to the decision must agree to reopen the hearings if such reopening would result in the arbitrators&rsquo; decision being delayed beyond the specific period agreed upon at the beginning of the arbitration proceedings.</p>
