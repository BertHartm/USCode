The Corporation shall recognize only one national governing body for each sport for which an application is made and approved. Prior to the recognition of a national governing body under the authority granted under this subchapter and in accordance with the procedures and requirements of this section, the Corporation shall hold a hearing open to the public on the application for such recognition. The Corporation shall publish notice of the time, place, and nature of the hearing.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) demonstrates that it is autonomous in the governance of its sport, in that it independently determines and controls all matters central to such governance, does not delegate such determination and control, and is free from outside restraint, and demonstrates that it is a member of no more than one international sports federation which governs a sport included on the program of the Olympic Games or the Pan-American Games;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) demonstrates that its membership is open to any individual who is an amateur athlete, coach, trainer, manager, administrator, or official active in the sport for which recognition is sought, or to any amateur sports organization which conducts programs in the sport for which recognition is sought, or to both;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) provides an equal opportunity to amateur athletes, coaches, trainers, managers, administrators, and officials to participate in amateur athletic competition, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, age, sex, or national origin, and with fair notice and opportunity for a hearing to any amateur athlete, coach, trainer, manager, administrator, or official before declaring such individual ineligible to participate;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) provides for reasonable direct representation on its board of directors or other such governing board for any amateur sports organization which, in the sport for which recognition is sought, conducts, on a level of proficiency appropriate for the selection of amateur athletes to represent the United States in international amateur athletic competition, a national program or regular national amateur athletic competition, and ensures that such representation shall reflect the nature, scope, quality, and strength of the programs and competitions of such amateur sports organization in relation to all other such programs and competitions in such sport in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) demonstrates that none of its officers are also officers of any other amateur sports organization which is recognized as a national governing body;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) provides procedures for the prompt and equitable resolution of grievances of its members;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) does not have eligibility criteria relating to amateur status which are more restrictive than those of the appropriate international sports federation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) demonstrates, if it is an amateur sports organization seeking recognition as a national governing body, that it is prepared to meet the obligations imposed on a national governing body under section 392 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Period within which to comply with eligibility requirements; suspension or revocation of recognition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), any amateur sports organization which on November 8, 1978, is recognized by the Corporation to represent a particular sport shall be considered to be the national governing body for that sport. Such an organization is exempt for a period of 2 years from November 8, 1978, from meeting the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, and during the 2-year period shall take the necessary actions to meet such requirements if it desires to retain its recognition. After the expiration of the 2-year period, such an organization shall continue as the national governing body for that sport unless the Corporation determines that such organization is not in compliance with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, in which event the Corporation shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) suspend the recognition of such national governing body;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) revoke the recognition of such national governing body; or</p>

Any such national governing body aggrieved by the Corporation's determination under this subsection may submit a demand for arbitration in accordance with section 395(c) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), the Corporation may suspend or revoke the recognition of a national governing body during the 2-year period if such suspension or revocation is for the same reason as the Corporation could have revoked or suspended such national governing body prior to November 8, 1978.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Recommendation of national governing body as United States representative to appropriate international sports federation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 61 days after recognizing an amateur sports organization as a national governing body, in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, the Corporation shall recommend and support in any appropriate manner such national governing body to the appropriate international sports federation as the representative of the United States for that sport.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Written complaint; exhaustion of remedies requirement; hearing; determination by Corporation; probation; revocation of recognition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any amateur sports organization or person which belongs to or is eligible to belong to a national governing body may seek to compel such national governing body to comply with the requirements of sections 391(b) and 392 of this title by filing a written complaint with the Corporation. Such organization or person may take such action only after having exhausted all available remedies within such national governing body for correcting deficiencies, unless it can be shown by clear and convincing evidence that those remedies would have resulted in unnecessary delay. The Corporation shall establish procedures for the filing and disposition of complaints received under this subsection. A copy of the complaint shall also be served on the applicable national governing body.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within 30 days after the filing of the complaint, the Corporation shall determine whether the organization has exhausted its remedies within the applicable national governing body, as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection. If the Corporation determines that any such remedies have not been exhausted, it may direct that such remedies be pursued before the Corporation will further consider the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Within 90 days after the filing of a complaint under paragraph (1) of this subsection, if the Corporation determines that all such remedies have been exhausted, it shall hold a hearing to receive testimony for the purpose of determining if such national governing body is in compliance with the requirements of sections 391(b) and 392 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Corporation determines, as a result of the hearings conducted pursuant to this subsection, that such national governing body is in compliance with the requirements of sections 391(b) and 392 of this title, it shall so notify the complainant and such national governing body.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:90 --><p class="statutory-body">(C) If the Corporation determines, as a result of hearings conducted pursuant to this subsection, that such national governing body is not in compliance with the requirements of sections 391(b) and 392 of this title, it shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) place such national governing body on probation for a specified period of time, not to exceed 180 days, which it considers necessary to enable such national governing body to comply with such requirements, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) revoke the recognition of such national governing body.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If the Corporation places a national governing body on probation pursuant to this paragraph, it may extend the probationary period if the national governing body has proven by clear and convincing evidence that, through no fault of its own, it needs additional time to comply with such requirements. If, at the end of the period allowed by the Corporation, the national governing body has not complied with such requirements, the Corporation shall revoke the recognition of such national governing body.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Replacement of incumbent national governing body</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Any amateur sports organization may seek to replace an incumbent as the national governing body for a particular sport by filing with the Corporation a written application for such recognition. Such application shall be filed (A) within the 1-year period after the final day of any Olympic Games, in the case of a sport for which competition is held in the Olympic Games or in both the Olympic and Pan-American Games; or (B) within the 1-year period after the final day of any Pan-American Games, in the case of a sport for which competition is held in the Pan-American Games and not in the Olympic Games. If two or more organizations file applications for the same sport, such applications shall be considered in a single proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any application filed under this subsection shall be filed with the Corporation by registered mail. The Corporation shall establish procedures for the filing and disposition of applications received under this subsection. A copy of any such application for recognition shall also be served on the applicable national governing body. The Corporation shall inform the applicant for recognition that its application has been received.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within 180 days after receipt of an application filed under this subsection, the Corporation shall conduct a formal hearing to determine the merits of the application. The Corporation shall publish notice of the time and place of such hearing in a regular issue of its principal publication at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, prior to the date of the hearing. In the course of such hearing, the applicant and the national governing body shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present evidence supporting their respective positions. During such hearing, the applicant amateur sports organization must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that it meets the criteria for recognition as a national governing body under section 391(b) of this title, and that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the national governing body does not meet the criteria of section 391(b) or 392 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it more adequately meets the criteria of section 391(b) of this title, is capable of more adequately meeting the criteria of section 392 of this title, and provides or is capable of providing a more effective national program of competition, than the national governing body in the sport for which it seeks recognition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Within 30 days of the close of the hearing required under this subsection, the Corporation shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) revoke the recognition of the national governing body and declare a vacancy in the national governing body for that sport;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the national governing body does not comply within the prescribed time period, the Corporation shall revoke the recognition of the national governing body and either recognize the applicant as the national governing body, or declare a vacancy in the national governing body for that sport.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Within 61 days after recognizing an amateur sports organization as a national governing body, in accordance with this subsection, the Corporation shall recommend and support in any appropriate manner such national governing body to the appropriate international sports federation as the representative of the United States for that sport.</p>
