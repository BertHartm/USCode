<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of the corporation are to bind together for their mutual fellowship and assistance those citizens of the United States of America who have served their country in war, and who bear as a mark of such service the loss of their sight and to perpetuate and keep alive the memories of their comradeship and to enable them by their organization to render what aid they can to the blind in general.</p>
