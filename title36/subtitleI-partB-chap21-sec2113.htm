<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Solicitation and Acceptance of Contributions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Consistent with its authority under section 2103(e) of this title, the American Battle Monuments Commission shall solicit and accept contributions for the World War II memorial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In this section, the term &ldquo;World War II memorial&rdquo; means the memorial authorized by Public Law 103&ndash;32 (40 U.S.C. 1003 note) to be established by the Commission on Federal land in the District of Columbia or its environs to honor members of the Armed Forces who served in World War II and to commemorate the participation of the United States in that war.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Creation of Memorial Fund</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) There is hereby created in the Treasury a fund for the World War II memorial, which shall consist of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Amounts deposited, and interest and proceeds credited, under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Obligations obtained under paragraph (3).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Any funds received by the Commission under section 2114 of this title in exchange for use of, or the right to use, any mark, copyright or patent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Chairman of the Commission shall deposit in the fund the amounts accepted as contributions under subsection (a). The Secretary of the Treasury shall credit to the fund the interest on, and the proceeds from sale or redemption of, obligations held in the fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest any portion of the fund that, as determined by the Chairman, is not required to meet current expenses. Each investment shall be made in an interest-bearing obligation of the United States or an obligation guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States that, as determined by the Chairman, has a maturity suitable for the fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Use of Fund</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The fund shall be available to the Commission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for the expenses of establishing the World War II memorial, including the maintenance and preservation amount provided for in section 8(b) of the Commemorative Works Act (40 U.S.C. 1008(b));</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Special Borrowing Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To assure that groundbreaking, construction, and dedication of the World War II memorial are carried out on a timely basis, the Commission may borrow money from the Treasury of the United States in such amounts as the Commission considers necessary, but not to exceed a total of $65,000,000. Borrowed amounts shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the average market yield on outstanding market<!-- PDFPage:40 -->able obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the month in which the obligations of the Commission are issued. The interest payments on such obligations may be deferred with the approval of the Secretary, but any interest payment so deferred shall also bear interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The borrowing of money by the Commission under paragraph (1) shall be subject to such maturities, terms, and conditions as may be agreed upon by the Commission and the Secretary, except that the maturities may not exceed 20 years and such borrowings may be redeemable at the option of the Commission before maturity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The obligations of the Commission shall be issued in amounts and at prices approved by the Secretary. The authority of the Commission to issue obligations under this subsection shall remain available without fiscal year limitation. The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase any obligations of the Commission to be issued under this subsection, and for such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury may use as a public debt transaction of the United States the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31. The purposes for which securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include any purchase of the Commission's obligations under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Repayment of the interest and principal on any funds borrowed by the Commission under paragraph (1) shall be made from amounts in the fund. The Commission may not use for such purpose any funds appropriated for any other activities of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Treatment of Borrowing Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining whether the Commission has sufficient funds to complete construction of the World War II memorial, as required by section 8 of the Commemorative Works Act (40 U.S.C. 1008), the Secretary of the Interior shall consider the funds that the Commission may borrow from the Treasury under subsection (d) as funds available to complete construction of the memorial, whether or not the Commission has actually exercised the authority to borrow such funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Voluntary Services</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Notwithstanding section 1342 of title 31, the Commission may accept from any person voluntary services to be provided in furtherance of the fund-raising activities of the Commission relating to the World War II memorial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person providing voluntary services under this subsection shall be considered to be a Federal employee for purposes of chapter 81 of title 5, relating to compensation for work-related injuries, and chapter 171 of title 28, relating to tort claims. A volunteer who is not otherwise employed by the United States shall not be considered to be a Federal employee for any other purpose by reason of the provision of such voluntary service, except that any volunteer given responsibility for the handling of funds or the carrying out of a Federal function is subject to the conflict of interest laws contained in chapter 11 of title 18 and the administrative standards of conduct contained in part 2635 of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission may provide for reimbursement of incidental expenses that are incurred by a person providing voluntary services under this subsection. The Commission shall determine those expenses that are eligible for reimbursement under this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Treatment of Certain Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contract entered into by the Commission for the design or construction of the World War II memorial is not a funding agreement as that term is defined in section 201 of title 35.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Extension of Authority To Establish Memorial</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding section 10 of the Commemorative Works Act (40 U.S.C. 1010), the authority for the construction of the World War II memorial provided by Public Law 103&ndash;32 (40 U.S.C. 1003 note) expires on December 31, 2005.</p>
