<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;at all times&rdquo; and &ldquo;authorized&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;Designation of the agent shall be filed&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;The corporation shall file .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a statement designating the initial and each successor registered agent of the corporation immediately following any such designation&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.
