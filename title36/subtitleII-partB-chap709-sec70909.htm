<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;Secretary of Education&rdquo; and &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;United States Commissioner of Education&rdquo;, &ldquo;Commissioner of Education&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Commissioner&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;Department of Education&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Office of Education&rdquo;, in section 18 of the Act of August 30, 1950 (ch. 823, 64 Stat. 567), because of 20:3441 and 3507. The words &ldquo;with the approval of the Federal Security Administrator&rdquo; and &ldquo;with the approval of the Administrator&rdquo; are omitted because the functions of the Federal Security Administrator were transferred to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare by section 5 of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953 (5 App. U.S.C.), and were subsequently transferred to the Secretary of Education by 20:3441. See also 20:3507. Substitution of a reference to the &ldquo;Secretary of Education&rdquo; would result in a requirement of the Secretary's own approval. The word &ldquo;activities&rdquo; (the first time it appears) is substituted for &ldquo;business and activities&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title.</p>
