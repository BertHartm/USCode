<p class="note-body">In this section, the text of 36:1306 (1st sentence) is omitted as executed and obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body">Before clause (1), the word &ldquo;objects&rdquo; is omitted as included in &ldquo;purposes&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;including&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the corporation shall have the following specific powers&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (1), the word &ldquo;adopt&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;enact&rdquo;, the word &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;rules, and regulations&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;for the management of its property and the regulation of its affairs&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;for its internal governance and management&rdquo;, for consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;not inconsistent with this chapter or other provisions of law&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (5), the words &ldquo;as the activities of the corporation require&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;as may be necessary to carry out the corporate purposes&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (6), the words &ldquo;make contracts&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;make and enter into contracts&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (7) is substituted for 36:1303(d) for consistency in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (8), the words &ldquo;for the purposes of the corporation&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;instruments of indebtedness, and secure its obligations by granting security interests in its property&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;bonds therefor, and secure the same by mortgage&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;subject in every case to all applicable provisions of Federal and State law&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (10), the words &ldquo;State, regional, local, and overseas&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;as needed&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;in such manner and by such rules as it deems appropriate so as to enable it&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;to carry out the purposes stated in section 220102 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;to carry out its powers and accomplish the objects and purposes set forth in section 1302 of this title&rdquo;, to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>

The words &ldquo;for the accomplishment of its purposes&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;accept gifts, legacies, devises, and support in furtherance thereof&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because the same power is granted by the words &ldquo;solicit funds&rdquo; (in this clause) and &ldquo;acquire [and] own .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. property&rdquo; (in clause (6)).</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (12), the words &ldquo;in any court&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
