<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Whereas on the twenty-second of August, eighteen hundred and sixty-four, at Geneva, Switzerland, plenipotentiaries respectively representing Italy, Baden, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Portugal, France, Prussia, Saxony, and Wurttemberg and the Federal Council of Switzerland agreed upon ten articles of a treaty or convention for the purpose of mitigating the evils inseparable from war; of ameliorating the condition of soldiers wounded on the field of battle, and particularly providing, among other things, in effect, that persons employed in hospitals and in according relief to the <!-- PDFPage:3 -->sick and wounded and supplies for this purpose shall be deemed neutral and entitled to protection; and that a distinctive and uniform flag shall be adopted for hospitals and ambulances and convoys of sick and wounded and an arm badge for individuals neutralized; and</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Whereas the said treaty has been revised and extended by a treaty or convention for the amelioration of the condition of the wounded and the sick of armies in the field, signed at Geneva, July 27, 1929, and adhered to by the United States of America, effective August 8, 1932; and</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Whereas the International Conference of Geneva of eighteen hundred and sixty-three recommended &lsquo;that there exist in every country a committee whose mission consists in cooperating in times of war with the hospital service of the armies by all means in its power;&rsquo; and</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Whereas a permanent organization is an agency needed in every nation to carry out the purposes of said treaties, and especially to secure supplies and to execute the humane objects contemplated by said treaties, with the power to adopt and use the distinctive flag and arm badge specified by said treaties, on which shall be the sign of the Red Cross, for the purpose of cooperating with the &lsquo;Comite�AE1 International de Secours aux Militaires Blesse�AE1s&rsquo; (International Committee of Relief for the Wounded in War); and</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Whereas in accordance with the requirements and customs of said international body such an association adopting and using said insignia was formed in the city of Washington, District of Columbia, in July, eighteen hundred and eighty-one known as &lsquo;The American National Association of the Red Cross,&rsquo; reincorporated April seventeenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-three, under the laws of the District of Columbia, and reincorporated by Act of Congress in June, nineteen hundred; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The governing body of the corporation in which all powers of government, direction, and management of the corporation shall be lodged, shall consist of a Board of Governors numbering fifty persons, to be appointed or elected in the manner following, namely:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Eight Governors shall be appointed by the President of the United States. Of the Governors so appointed, one shall be designated by the President of the United States to act as the principal officer of the corporation with such title and such functions as may from time to time be prescribed in the bylaws; and the remainder shall be officials of departments and agencies of the Federal Government, whose positions and interests are such as to qualify them to contribute toward the accomplishment of Red Cross programs and objectives. Of these at least one and not more than three shall be selected from the armed forces.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Thirty Governors shall be elected by the chapters. The Governors so elected shall be elected at the national convention under procedures for nomination and election which shall be such as to insure equitable representation of all the chapters, having regard to geographical considerations, to the size of the chapters and to the size of the populations served by the chapters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Twelve Governors shall be elected by the Board of Governors as members-at-large. The Governors so elected shall be individuals who are representative of the national interests which it is the function of the Red Cross to serve, and with which it is desirable that the corporation shall have close association.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The term of office of all Governors shall be three years, except that the term of office of any Governor appointed by the President of the United States (other than the principal officer of the corporation) shall expire if and when such <!-- PDFPage:5 -->Governor shall retire, prior to the date on which his term as Governor would otherwise expire, from the official position held at the time of his appointment as Governor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Of the first Board of Governors to be selected hereunder, those Governors to be elected pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall be elected at the first national convention following May 8, 1947, those Governors to be elected pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall be elected as soon as practicable following such first national convention, and those Governors to be appointed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be appointed so as to take office at the same time. The Governors so elected pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be divided by lot into three classes, the terms of which shall expire at the end of one, two, and three years, respectively, so that thereafter one-third of the members of the Board of Governors elected pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of this section will be chosen at the time of each national convention, and shall take office at such time or as soon as practicable thereafter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The President of the United States shall fill as soon as may be any vacancy that may occur by death, resignation, or otherwise in the office of the principal officer of the corporation or in the membership of the Board of Governors appointed by him. Any vacancy that may occur in the Governors elected by the chapters pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or in the Governors-at-large elected by the Board of Governors pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, shall be temporarily filled by appointment made by the Board of Governors, such appointees to serve until the next national convention.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board of Governors shall have power (i) to appoint from its own members an executive committee of not less than eleven persons, who, when the Board of Governors is not in session, shall have and exercise all the powers of the Board of Governors, and (ii) to appoint and remove, or provide for the appointment and removal of, all officers and employees of the corporation, except the principal officer designated by the President of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The annual meeting of the corporation shall be the national convention of delegates of the chapters, which shall be held annually on such date and at such place as may be specified by the Board of Governors.
