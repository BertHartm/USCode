<!-- PDFPage:3 --><p class="note-body">&ldquo;Whereas the International Conference of Geneva of eighteen hundred and sixty-three recommended &lsquo;that there exist in every country a committee whose mission consists in cooperating in times of war with the hospital service of the armies by all means in its power;&rsquo; and</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Whereas a permanent organization is an agency needed in every nation to carry out the purposes of said treaties, and especially to secure supplies and to execute the humane objects contemplated by said treaties, with the power to adopt and use the distinctive flag and arm badge specified by said treaties, on which shall be the sign of the Red Cross, for the purpose of cooperating with the &lsquo;Comite�AE1 International de Secours aux Militaires Blesse�AE1s&rsquo; (International Committee of Relief for the Wounded in War); and</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Whereas in accordance with the requirements and customs of said international body such an association adopting and using said insignia was formed in the city of Washington, District of Columbia, in July, eighteen hundred and eighty-one known as &lsquo;The American National Association of the Red Cross,&rsquo; reincorporated April seventeenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-three, under the laws of the District of Columbia, and reincorporated by Act of Congress in June, nineteen hundred; and</p>
