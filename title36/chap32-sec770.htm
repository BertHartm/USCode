<p class="statutory-body">(a) No part of the income or assets of the corporation shall inure to any of its members or officers as such, or be distributed to any of them during the life of the corporation or upon its dissolution or final liquidation. Nothing in this subsection, however, shall be construed to prevent the payment of compensation to officers of the corporation or reimbursement for actual necessary expenses in amounts approved by the board of administration of the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The corporation shall not make loans to its officers or employees. Any member of the board of administration who votes for or assents to the making of a loan or advance to an officer or employee of the corporation, and any officer who participates in the making of such a loan or advance, shall be jointly and severally liable to the corporation for the amount of such loan until the repayment thereof.</p>
