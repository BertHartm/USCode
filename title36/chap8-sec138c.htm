The account shall be used to provide funds, in addition to funds appropriated for salaries and expenses of the American Battle Monuments Commission, to pay the costs of such salaries and expenses that exceed the amount appropriated therefor as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates of foreign countries occurring after a budget request for the Commission is submitted to Congress. The account may not be used for any other purpose. Funds in the account may be transferred to funds appropriated for salaries and expenses of the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Merger and availability of transferred funds; increase in permissible obligations of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Funds transferred under subsection (a) of this section shall be merged with and available for the same time period as the appropriation to which they are applied.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) because of subsequent favorable fluctuations in the rates or because other funds are, or become, available to pay such obligations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Time of return</h4>
