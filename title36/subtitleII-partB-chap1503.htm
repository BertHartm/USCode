<!-- PDFPage:171 --><p class="note-body">(b) To survey the broad possibilities of science, to formulate comprehensive projects of research, and to develop effective means of utilizing the scientific and technical resources of the country for dealing with such projects.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) To promote cooperation in research, at home and abroad, in order to secure concentration of effort, minimize duplication, and stimulate progress; but in all cooperative undertakings to give encouragement to individual initiative, as fundamentally important to the advancement of science.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) To serve as a means of bringing American and foreign investigators into active cooperation with the scientific and technical services of the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) To direct the attention of scientific and technical investigators to the importance of military and industrial problems in connection with national security, to the importance of environmental problems in connection with public health and the economy, and to aid in the solution of these problems by organizing specific research.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) To gather and collate scientific and technical information, at home and abroad, in cooperation with governmental and other agencies, and to disseminate such information to duly accredited persons and the public.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Scientists, engineers, and other technically qualified professionals who are officers or employees of departments and agencies of the executive branch of the Government are encouraged to participate in the work of the Council as requested by the Council to the extent authorized by the head of the officer's or employee's agency or department and permitted by law.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. To the extent permitted by law and regulation, and in accordance with the congressional charter of the Academy, the actual expense of investigations, examinations, experiments, and reports by the Academy for the executive branch of the Government shall be paid to the Academy through one or more of the following: private gifts and bequests; appropriations for the benefit of the Academy; grants-in-aid, contracts, and other forms of financial agreement with executive departments and agencies. The Academy shall receive no compensation whatever for any services to the Government of the United States. Further, the Academy shall be subject to all provisions of OMB Circular A&ndash;122, &ldquo;Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations,&rdquo; and to such other requirements regarding or limiting the Academy's recovery of costs as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget may specify from time to time in writing to the Academy and to agencies and departments of the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">4. When a department or agency of the executive branch of the Government determines that the Academy, because of its unique qualifications, is the only source that can provide the measure of expertise, independence, objectivity, and audience acceptance necessary to meet the department's or agency's program requirements, acquisition of services by the Academy may be obtained on a noncompetitive basis if otherwise in accordance with applicable law and regulations.</p>
