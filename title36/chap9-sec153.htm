<p class="statutory-body">The civil and educational authorities of States, counties, cities, and towns be, and they are, urged to make plans for the proper observance of this day and for the full instruction of citizens in their responsibilities and opportunities as citizens of the United States and of the States and localities in which they reside.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing herein shall be construed as changing, or attempting to change, the time or mode of any of the many altogether commendable observances of similar nature now being held from time to time, or periodically, but, to the contrary, such practices are praised and encouraged.</p>
