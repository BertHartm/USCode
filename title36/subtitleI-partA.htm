<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Short Title</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;James Madison Commemoration Commission Act&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Table of Contents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;[Omitted.]</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) March 16, 2001, marks the 250th anniversary of the birth of James Madison;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) as a delegate to the Continental Congress, and to the Annapolis Convention of 1786, James Madison foresaw the need for a more effective national government and was a persuasive advocate for such a government at the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention of 1787;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) James Madison worked tirelessly and successfully at the Constitutional Convention to mold a national charter, the United States Constitution, that combined both energy and restraint, empowering the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary, within a framework of limited government, separated powers, and a system of federalism;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) James Madison was an eloquent proponent of the first 10 amendments to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) James Madison faithfully served his country as a Representative in Congress from 1789 to 1797, as Secretary of State from 1801 to 1809, and as President of the United States from 1809 to 1817;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) as President, James Madison showed courage and resolute will in leading the United States to victory over Great Britain in the War of 1812;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) James Madison's political writings, as exemplified by his Notes on the Federal Convention and his contributions to The Federalist Papers, are among the most distinguished of American state papers;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) by his learning, his devotion to ordered liberty, and by the force of his intellect, James Madison made an indispensable contribution to the American tradition of democratic constitutional republicanism embodied in the Constitution of the United States, and is justifiably acclaimed as father of the Constitution;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) it is appropriate to remember, honor, and renew the legacy of James Madison for the American people and, indeed for all mankind; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) as the Nation approaches March 16, 2001, marking the anniversary of the birth of James Madison, it is appropriate to establish a commission for the commemoration of that anniversary.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Proc. No. 5574. The Rose Proclaimed the National Foral Emblem of the United States of America</h4>
<p class="note-body">Proc. No. 5574, Nov. 20, 1986, 51 F.R. 42197, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Americans have always loved the flowers with which God decorates our land. More often than any other flower, we hold the rose dear as the symbol of life and love and devotion, of beauty and eternity. For the love of man and woman, for the love of mankind and God, for the love of country, Americans who would speak the language of the heart do so with a rose.</p>
<p class="note-body">We see proofs of this everywhere. The study of fossils reveals that the rose has existed in America for age upon age. We have always cultivated roses in our gardens. Our first President, George Washington, bred roses, and a variety he named after his mother is still grown today. The White House itself boasts a beautiful Rose Garden. We grow roses in all our fifty States. We find roses throughout our art, music, and literature. We decorate our celebrations and parades with roses. Most of all, we present roses to those we love, and we lavish them on our altars, our civil shrines, and the final resting places of our honored dead.</p>
<p class="note-body">The American people have long held a special place in their hearts for roses. Let us continue to cherish them, to honor the love and devotion they represent, and to bestow them on all we love just as God has bestowed them on us.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 159 [Pub. L. 99&ndash;449, now this section], has designated the rose as the National Floral Emblem of the United States and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation declaring this fact.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the rose as the National Floral Emblem of the United States of America.</p>
<p class="note-body">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.</p>
<p class="presidential-signature">Ronald Reagan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
