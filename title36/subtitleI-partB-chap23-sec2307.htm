<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words &ldquo;or authorities&rdquo; are added for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code and for clarity because the Council may make contracts or other arrangements with State authorities.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words &ldquo;departments, agencies, and instrumentalities in the executive branch of the United States Government&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;executive branch departments, agencies, and establishments of the United States&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code.</p>
