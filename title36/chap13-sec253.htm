<p class="note-body">(c) To promote cooperation in research, at home and abroad, in order to secure concentration of effort, minimize duplication, and stimulate progress; but in all cooperative undertakings to give encouragement to individual initiative, as fundamentally important to the advancement of science.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) To serve as a means of bringing American and foreign investigators into active cooperation with the scientific and technical services of the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) To direct the attention of scientific and technical investigators to the importance of military and industrial problems in connection with national security, to the importance of environmental problems in connection with public health and the economy, and to aid in the solution of these problems by organizing specific research.</p>

<p class="note-body">3.
