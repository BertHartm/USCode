<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), before clause (1), the text of 36:121 (last par.) is omitted as executed. In clauses (2) and (3), the word &ldquo;same&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary. In clause (2), the words &ldquo;authorized to be paid&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; for consistency with clause (3) and 37:405.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c) is based on 36:122 which is from the 2d proviso in the paragraph under the heading &ldquo;American Battle Monuments Commission&rdquo; in title III of the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 104&ndash;204, 110 Stat. 2907). The provision has been repeated each year in prior appropriations acts and therefore is restated as a permanent provision. For prior provisions, see citations under 36:122 (1994 ed.). In the restatement, the words &ldquo;in the same way as&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;as provided for&rdquo; for clarity and consistency in the revised title.</p>
