<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Short Title</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;James Madison Commemoration Commission Act&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Table of Contents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;[Omitted.]</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) March 16, 2001, marks the 250th anniversary of the birth of James Madison;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) as a delegate to the Continental Congress, and to the Annapolis Convention of 1786, James Madison foresaw the need for a more effective national government and was a persuasive advocate for such a government at the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention of 1787;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) James Madison worked tirelessly and successfully at the Constitutional Convention to mold a national charter, the United States Constitution, that combined both energy and restraint, empowering the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary, within a framework of limited government, separated powers, and a system of federalism;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) James Madison was an eloquent proponent of the first 10 amendments to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) James Madison faithfully served his country as a Representative in Congress from 1789 to 1797, as Secretary of State from 1801 to 1809, and as President of the United States from 1809 to 1817;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) as President, James Madison showed courage and resolute will in leading the United States to victory over Great Britain in the War of 1812;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) James Madison's political writings, as exemplified by his Notes on the Federal Convention and his contributions to The Federalist Papers, are among the most distinguished of American state papers;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) by his learning, his devotion to ordered liberty, and by the force of his intellect, James Madison made an indispensable contribution to the American tradition of democratic constitutional republicanism embodied in the Constitution of the United States, and is justifiably acclaimed as father of the Constitution;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) it is appropriate to remember, honor, and renew the legacy of James Madison for the American people and, indeed for all mankind; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) as the Nation approaches March 16, 2001, marking the anniversary of the birth of James Madison, it is appropriate to establish a commission for the commemoration of that anniversary.</p>
