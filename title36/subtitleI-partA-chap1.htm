<h4 class="note-head">Proc. No. 8380. Armed Forces Day</h4>
<p class="note-body">Proc. No. 8380, May 14, 2009, 74 F.R. 23603, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">On Armed Forces Day, 1961, President Kennedy connected civic engagement and our Nation's security. He stated, &ldquo;the strength of our armed forces rests not alone upon their active and reserve members, our industrial productivity, and our human resources, but also upon the understanding and support of an informed American people.&rdquo; Based on this perspective, I call upon all Americans to learn more about, and express gratitude for, the heroic efforts of our men and women in uniform.</p>
<p class="note-body">Today, the United States military serves across the world to keep us safe. They are working here at home to protect America from threats foreign and domestic; they are risking their lives in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan; and they are also serving bravely in many other parts of the world to ensure our security and provide humanitarian assistance. Members of the Armed Forces are forging a better future for our Nation and the world.</p>
<p class="note-body">As they carry out their missions, military families endure the sacrifice of their absence. Worrying about their safety, moving to new duty stations, and managing a home without a loved one, these families shoulder great burdens as they help sustain our men and women in uniform. I thank military families for their vital contributions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coastguardsmen who have answered the call to service deserve recognition and gratitude. They have endured the most difficult of conditions to protect America and her highest ideals. Today, I ask all Americans to know their sacrifice and join me in humble thanks.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, continuing the precedent of my predecessors in office, do hereby proclaim the third Saturday of each May as Armed Forces Day.</p>
<p class="note-body">I direct the Secretary of Defense on behalf of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and the Secretary of Homeland Security on behalf of the Coast Guard, to plan for appropriate observances each year, with the Secretary of Defense responsible for soliciting the participation and cooperation of civil authorities and private citizens.</p>
<p class="note-body">I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to provide for the observance of Armed Forces Day within their jurisdiction each year in an appropriate manner designed to increase public understanding and appreciation of the Armed Forces of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">I also invite national and local veterans, civic and other organizations to join in the observance of Armed Forces Day each year.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, I call upon all Americans to display the flag of the United States at their homes on Armed Forces Day and urge citizens to learn more about military service by attending and participating in the local observances of the day. I also encourage Americans to volunteer at organizations that provide support to our troops.</p>
<p class="note-body">Proclamation 7562 of May 16, 2002, is hereby superseded.</p>

<p class="note-body">Our Nation's farm and ranch families supply many of the basic necessities of our daily life. They manage a large portion of our country's fertile land base, and they are caretakers of our valuable natural resources and diverse ecosystems. Their connections with urban and suburban communities are critical to our economy and to the nourishment of our people. During National Farm-City Week, we express gratitude for the contributions of our Nation's farmers and ranchers, and we rededicate ourselves to providing all Americans with access to healthy food, and thus, a healthy future.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pioneered by Native Americans, agriculture was our Nation's first industry. For agriculture to thrive in the 21st century, we must continue to cultivate the relationships between farmers and rural businesses and their partners and customers in cities and towns. <!-- PDFPage:17 -->American farmers and ranchers are proud to grow the food, feed, fuel, and fiber that enhance our national security and prosperity, and remain steadfast stewards of the land they love. We must ensure that farming is maintained as an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable way of life for future generations.</p>
<p class="note-body">This Thanksgiving season, we celebrate farms of every size that produce fruits, vegetables, dairy, and livestock indispensable to the health of our families. We also recognize the vital ties between our urban and suburban communities and their local farmers through regional food systems, farmers markets, and community gardens. During National Farm-City Week, we celebrate the bounty of America, and we honor the commitment of those who grow, harvest, and deliver agricultural goods to feed our country and grow our economy.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week ending on Thanksgiving Day of each year as National Farm-City Week.

<p class="note-body">Proc. No. 8442, Oct. 23, 2009, 74 F.R. 55437, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">America's forests have helped spur the growth and development that has been indispensable to our Nation's success. They have provided timber and water, as well as habitat for wildlife and opportunities for recreational activities. As a repository for renewable natural resources, forests have supplied the raw materials that have sustained us throughout our history. During National Forest Products Week, we recognize the value of our woodlands and commit ourselves to good stewardship and conservation practices that help us to responsibly manage our Nation's forests.</p>
<p class="note-body">As a renewable and recyclable resource, wood is one of our Nation's most environmentally friendly building materials. Wood fiber is used throughout our daily lives, from the paper we write on to the offices where we work. We value the beauty of wood in our furniture, in our homes, and in artwork that surrounds us. Today, modern technology and stewardship practices by Federal, State, tribal, and private landowners have improved the way we manage our natural resources so that forests can meet the needs of current and future generations.</p>
<p class="note-body">Forests are one of the foundations on which our Nation was formed; they are the backbone of our environment. This week, we recognize the value of forest products and the importance of their sustainable use to our lives.</p>
<p class="note-body">To recognize the importance of products from our forests, the Congress, by Public Law 86&ndash;753 (36 U.S.C. 123), as amended, has designated the week beginning on the third Sunday in October of each year as National Forest Products Week and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning on the third Sunday in October of each year as National Forest Products Week. I call on all Americans to celebrate the varied uses and products of our forested lands, as well as the people who carry on the tradition of careful stewardship of these precious natural resources for generations to come.</p>
<p class="note-body">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.</p>
