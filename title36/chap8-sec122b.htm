The Commission shall be solely responsible for the design and construction of such permanent cemeteries, and of all buildings, plantings, headstones, and other permanent improvements incidental thereto except that (1) the Armed Forces shall be responsible for the maintenance of such permanent cemeteries until such time as the Commission shall express its readiness to assume the functions of administration hereinafter authorized, (2) all construction undertaken by the Armed Forces in establishing and maintaining the cemetery prior to its transfer to the Commission shall be nonpermanent in nature, (3) burials and reburials therein by the Armed Forces shall be carried out in accordance with plans prepared by the Commission, (4) the Armed Forces shall have the right to re-enter any cemeteries transferred to the Commission for the purpose of making exhumations or reinterments should they deem any such action to be necessary.</p>
