Nothing in this subsection, however, shall be construed to prevent the payment of reasonable compensation to officers or employees of the corporation or reimbursement for actual expenses in amounts approved by the board of trustees of the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The corporation shall not make loans to its officers, trustees, or employees. Any director who votes for or assents to the making of a loan or advance to an officer, director, or employee of the corporation, and any officer who participates in the making of such loan or an advance shall be jointly and severally liable to the corporation for the amount of such loan or advance until the repayment thereof.</p>
