<h4 class="note-head">Pub. L. 105&ndash;354</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amends section 902 of title 36 to reflect changes made by section 1082 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 (Public Law 105&ndash;85, Nov. 18, 1997, 111 Stat. 1917, 36 App. U.S.C. 189a).</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 1082(h), which required that regulations be prescribed no later than 180 days after enactment of Public law 105&ndash;85, is repealed as executed.</p>
