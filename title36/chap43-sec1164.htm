Nothing in this subsection, however, shall be construed to prevent the payment of reasonable compensation to officers and employees of the corporation or to prevent their reimbursement for actual necessary expenses in amounts approved by the corporation's board of directors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The corporation shall not make loans to its members, officers, directors, or employees.
