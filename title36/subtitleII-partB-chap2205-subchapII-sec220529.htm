<p class="statutory-body">(2) On receipt of a demand for arbitration, the Association shall serve notice on the parties to the arbitration and on the corporation, and shall immediately proceed with arbitration according to the commercial rules of the Association in effect at the time the demand is filed, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the arbitration panel shall consist of at least 3 arbitrators, unless the parties to the proceeding agree to a lesser number;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the arbitration hearing shall take place at a site selected by the Association, unless the parties to the proceeding agree to the use of another site; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the arbitration hearing shall be open to the public.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) The parties may offer any evidence they desire and shall produce any additional evidence the arbitrators believe is necessary to an understanding and determination of the dispute.

<!-- PDFPage:276 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Settlement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The arbitrators may settle a dispute arising under this chapter before making a final award, if agreed to by the parties and achieved in a manner not inconsistent with the constitution and bylaws of the corporation.</p>
