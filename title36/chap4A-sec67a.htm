<h4 class="note-head">Codification</h4>
<p class="note-body">Amendment of this section by Pub. L. 95&ndash;98, &sect;1(a), Aug. 15, 1977, 91 Stat. 830, which directed that &ldquo;AMVETS (American Veterans of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam)&rdquo; be substituted for &ldquo;AMVETS (American Veterans of World War II)&rdquo; has not been executed to text because the organization name is used in this section in the context of a historical reference to the name of the predecessor unincorporated association as that association existed at the time of the 1945 convention, at which time the association was named &ldquo;AMVETS (American Veterans of World War II)&rdquo;.</p>
