<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before paragraph (1), the words &ldquo;Secretary of the Army&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Secretary of War&rdquo; in section 8 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 (ch. 250, 41 Stat. 992) because of section 205(a) of the National Security Act of 1947 (ch. 343, 61 Stat. 501). See 10 U.S.C. 3011 et seq. In paragraph (3), the words &ldquo;apparatus&rdquo; and &ldquo;appliances&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. In paragraph (4), the words &ldquo;consult with&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;advise with&rdquo; as being more grammatical.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;rates or practices&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;rates, charges, rules, or regulations&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.</p>
