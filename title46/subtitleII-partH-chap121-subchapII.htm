<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Authority of non-citizens</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If any person that is not a citizen of the United States has authority to direct or participate in directing a trustee for a trust in matters involving any ownership or operation of the vessel that may adversely affect the interests of the United States or in removing a trustee for a trust without cause, either directly or indirectly through the control of another person, the trust is not qualified under this paragraph unless the trust instrument provides that persons who are not citizens of the United States may not hold more than 25 percent of the aggregate authority to so direct or remove a trustee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Ownership by non-citizens</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subparagraphs (A) and (B) do not prohibit a person that is not a citizen of the United States from holding more than 25 percent of the beneficial interest in a trust.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the transportation of merchandise or personnel to or from a point in the United States from or to a mobile offshore drilling unit located over the outer Continental Shelf that is not attached to the seabed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Coastwise trade not authorized</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in paragraph (1) authorizes the employment in the coastwise trade of a vessel that does not meet the requirements of section 12112 of this title.</p>

C, title II) (16 U.S.C. 1851 note), referred to in subsec. <!-- PDFPage:175 -->(d)(2)(B), probably should be a reference to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (see note below). Subsec. (d)(2)(B) of this section was derived from former section 12102(c)(5)(B) of this title in the general amendment of this chapter by Pub. L. 109&ndash;304, &sect;5, Oct. 6, 2006, 120 Stat. 1491.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (d)(2), the words before subparagraph (A) are substituted for &ldquo;no vessel owned by any such corporation shall engage in the fisheries or in the transportation of merchandise or passengers for hire between points in the United States, including Territories, Districts, and possessions thereof, embraced within the coastwise laws, except&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.
