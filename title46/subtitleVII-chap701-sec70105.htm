<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Issuance of Cards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall issue a biometric transportation security card to an individual specified in paragraph (2), unless the Secretary decides that the individual poses a security risk under subsection (c) warranting denial of the card.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) give consideration to the circumstances of any disqualifying act or offense, restitution <!-- PDFPage:396 -->made by the individual, Federal and State mitigation remedies, and other factors from which it may be concluded that the individual does not pose a terrorism risk warranting denial of the card; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) issue a waiver to an individual without regard to whether that individual would otherwise be disqualified if the individual's employer establishes alternate security arrangements acceptable to the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
