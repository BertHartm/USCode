<p class="note-body">Section 2101(1) defines the type of &ldquo;associated equipment&rdquo; that is involved in the use of recreational boats that are subject to Federal regulatory authority. This equipment is subject to a number of controls under federally established construction and performance standards. Radio equipment is exempt from these regulatory controls, since this equipment continues to be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(2) defines &ldquo;barge&rdquo; as a vessel that is non-self-propelled and that is often pushed ahead, towed alongside, or towed astern on a hawser by a towing vessel. It does not include a vessel that is propelled by sail only.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(3) defines &ldquo;boundary line&rdquo; for the establishment of jurisdictional parameters for various maritime safety laws. Public Law 96&ndash;324, codified at 33 U.S.C. 151, permits the Secretary to establish appropriate identifiable lines dividing inland waters of the U.S. from the high seas for the purpose of determining the applicability of these laws. These laws will now be included within subtitle II of title 46&mdash;Shipping. These lines may not be located more than twelve nautical miles seaward of the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured and may differ in position for the purposes of different parts or sections of subtitle II.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(4) defines &ldquo;Coast Guard&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(5) provides that wherever the term &ldquo;commercial service&rdquo; is used it is to include all vessels except those that are primarily used for combatant purposes. This is to make sure that vessels that are engaged in the transportation of goods or individuals are subject to the applicable maritime and environmental safety laws, even if they are sovereign controlled vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(6) defines &ldquo;consular officer&rdquo; as one who has authority to issue visas. Traditionally this person is knowledgeable and familiar with the maritime safety and seamen's welfare laws.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(7) defines &ldquo;crude oil&rdquo; because certain equipment requirements like inert gas systems, segregated ballast tanks, crude oil washing systems or special ballast arrangements are applicable only to tank vessels that carry crude oil. Crude oil is still included within the definition of &ldquo;hazardous material&rdquo; and &ldquo;oil&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(8) defines a &ldquo;crude oil tanker&rdquo; as one engaged in carrying crude oil. The definition does not include a tank barge since a tanker is defined as a self-propelled tank vessel. See also 2101(38).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(9) makes it clear that the term &ldquo;discharge&rdquo; when referring to a substance that emanates from a vessel and is related to the marine environmental laws concerning pollution by oil or hazardous substances.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(10) defines a &ldquo;documented vessel&rdquo; as any vessel of the United States that has been issued a certificate of documentation that might include a register, enrollment, license, or enrollment and license for various trades.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(11) lists what is included in the term &ldquo;fisheries&rdquo; for the purpose of documentation of vessels <!-- PDFPage:12 -->and is intended to be all-inclusive of the numerous types of fishing activities.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(12) defines &ldquo;foreign vessel&rdquo; as any foreign flag or foreign operated vessel that is operated under the jurisdiction or authority of a government other than the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(13) defines a &ldquo;freight vessel&rdquo; as a motor vessel or any vessel propelled by diesel or other internal combustion engines and that carries freight for hire.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(14) defines &ldquo;hazardous materials&rdquo; as a broad range of materials that are not only flammable or combustible but are also designated under related maritime safety and environmental laws.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(15) defines &ldquo;marine environment&rdquo; as an all-inclusive term that was developed to cover land and water areas that could be affected by pollution from all vessels and not only tank vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(16) defines &ldquo;motor vessel&rdquo; as a vessel propelled by machinery other than steam to make it clear that these vessels are not steam vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(17) defines &ldquo;nautical school vessel&rdquo; as a vessel that can be a privately owned and operated as well as a publicly owned and operated school vessel.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(18) defines &ldquo;oceanographic research vessel&rdquo; as a vessel employed in oceanography or limnology research or instruction. It is defined because this type of vessel, while not inspected and certified as such, is subject to a number of special statutory and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(19) defines &ldquo;offshore supply vessel&rdquo; as a class of vessel that is limited by tonnage and its employment in the mineral and oil industry and while so employed it is not a small passenger vessel.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(20) defines &ldquo;oil&rdquo; to include oil of any type, in any form, or in any mixture. This is the definition that originated with marine environment and pollution laws and continues the definition that was adopted by port and tanker safety laws.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(21) defines the term &ldquo;passengers&rdquo; in relation to various types of vessels. Due to the complexity of existing laws with respect to the definitions of &ldquo;passenger&rdquo; on various categories of vessels and the need to not make any changes of a substantive nature that could be construed as controversial, four definitions of &ldquo;passenger&rdquo; have been included.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(22) defines &ldquo;passenger vessel&rdquo; as one that is at least 100 gross tons and carries at least one passenger for hire.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(23) defines &ldquo;product carrier&rdquo; as a tanker that is engaged in carrying oil. This definition when read with the definition of tanker means that it is a self-propelled vessel. A tank barge carrying oil products is a tank vessel but is not subject to the special standards or requirements for a product carrier.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(24) defines a &ldquo;public vessel&rdquo; as a governmental vessel that is not in commercial service. It should be noted that a sovereign-controlled foreign-flag vessel that is engaged in commercial service is not a public vessel and is subject to maritime safety and environment laws.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(25) defines a &ldquo;recreational vessel&rdquo; as a class of vessel whose primary purpose is for pleasure. These vessels while not subject to inspection are subject to certain requirements of law to improve boating safety.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(26) defines a &ldquo;recreational vessel manufacturer&rdquo; as one that is involved with not only the recreational vessels themselves but also with their components or associated equipment.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(27), (28), (29), and (30) provides a number of definitions that define the type of instruction, instructor, student, and vessel that is involved in the teaching of sailing.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(31) defines &ldquo;scientific personnel&rdquo; as individuals engaged in oceanography or limnology because they are specially treated under various maritime safety requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(32) defines a &ldquo;seagoing barge&rdquo; as a vessel that is at least 100 gross tons making voyages to sea beyond the boundary line.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(33) defines a &ldquo;seagoing motor vessel&rdquo; as a vessel that must be a motor vessel, as defined in 2101(15), of at least 300 gross tons making voyages to sea beyond the boundary line.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(34) defines &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; so that maritime safety and seamen's welfare jurisdiction remains within the Coast Guard at all times.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(35) defines &ldquo;small passenger vessel&rdquo; as one that is less than 100 gross tons carrying more than six passengers as defined in section 2101(21).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(36) defines &ldquo;State&rdquo; as a State, territory or possession of the United States and is used to establish jurisdictional limits for the application of the various maritime safety and environmental safety laws of this subtitle. This definition is further limited by definitions in section 2102 that relate to recreational boating safety and facility improvement programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(37) defines a &ldquo;steam vessel&rdquo; as a vessel propelled by steam. However, steam vessels of not more than 40 feet that are used exclusively for pleasure are not included.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(38) defines &ldquo;tanker&rdquo; as a self-propelled tank vessel that has been constructed or primarily adapted to carry oil or hazardous material in bulk in the cargo spaces. This vessel is a subclass of tank vessel, which is defined in section 2101(39). This subclass definition is necessary because certain statutory minimum requirements that are consistent with internationally accepted standards are solely applicable to these vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(39) defines a &ldquo;tank vessel&rdquo; as a vessel carrying oil or hazardous materials in bulk or residue including a tanker as defined in section 2101(38).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(40) defines &ldquo;towing vessel&rdquo; as a vessel in commercial service that pushes, pulls, or tows alongside and includes what is traditionally known as a tug.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(41) defines &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; which, in part, facilitates the classification of vessels that may be numbered by the proper issuing authority in a State.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(42) defines an &ldquo;uninspected passenger vessel&rdquo; as a vessel carrying six or less passengers.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(43) defines an &ldquo;uninspected vessel&rdquo; as a vessel not subject to inspection and certification by the Coast Guard under section 3301. Recreational vessels and inland towing vessels are typical uninspected vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(44) defines &ldquo;United States&rdquo; to establish geographical boundaries for the applicability of the various maritime safety and environmental safety laws of this subtitle. This definition is further limited by definitions in section 2102 that relate to recreational boating safety and facility improvement programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(45) makes it clear that &ldquo;vessel&rdquo; as used in this subtitle has the same meaning as is provided in section 3 of title 1, of the U.S.C.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(46) defines &ldquo;vessel of the United States&rdquo; as a vessel that is documented or numbered under the laws of the United States. A documented vessel and those vessels that are numbered by a State or Federal authority are afforded the protection of the laws of the United States.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 2107 provides for standard procedures for the handling of civil penalties for infractions of law or regulation. Some changes were made to increase some antiquated and inadequate penalties.</p>
<p class="note-body">The assessment of civil penalties under this section should not require an &ldquo;on the record&rdquo; hearing within the meaning of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). It is intended that these civil penalties be assessed in a fair manner. However, the Committee recognizes that statutes passed in the last decade have involved the Coast Guard in tens of thousands of civil penalty enforcement cases and that it is necessary that the penalties be assessed efficiently. The Coast Guard's procedural regulations for assessing civil penalties ensure that the essential elements of due process, notice, and opportunity to be heard, are provided to alleged violators (see 33 CFR Subpart 1.07). The more rigid and time-consuming procedures applicable to APA adjudications are unwarranted in the case of Coast Guard civil penalty assessment procedures and would seriously hamper the orderly enforcement of these administrative penalties.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 2302 states that the negligent operation of a vessel is prohibited. These acts are subject to civil and criminal penalties and the involved vessel is subject to an in rem action. The negligent operation provisions have their genesis in the Act of April 25, 1940, 54 Stat. <!-- PDFPage:22 -->167, when Congress prescribed that no person shall operate any motorboat or <em>any vessel</em> in a reckless or negligent manner. This provision was directed at all vessels and not those solely engaged in recreational boating. When the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971, P.L. 92&ndash;75, 85 Stat. 217 (46 U.S.C. 1461) was enacted it adopted the reckless or negligent operation provisions of the 1940 Act. It adopted for the first time a provision for assessing civil penalties in addition to criminal penalties. It dropped the word &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; because of redundancy. It also combined the two classes of vessels; &ldquo;any motorboat or any vessel&rdquo; into one class by using the word &ldquo;vessel&rdquo; and defined vessel as including every description of watercraft.</p>
