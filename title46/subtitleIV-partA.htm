<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An ocean common carrier that is a party to or is otherwise subject to a collective bargaining agreement with a labor organization shall, in response to a written request by the labor organization, state whether it is responsible for the following work at a dock area or within a port area in the United States with respect to cargo transportation under a service contract:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The movement of the shipper's cargo on a dock area or within the port area or to or from railroad cars on a dock area or within the port area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The assignment of intraport carriage of the shipper's cargo between areas on a dock or within the port area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The assignment of the carriage of the shipper's cargo between a container yard on a dock area or within the port area and a rail yard adjacent to the container yard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The assignment of container freight station work and container maintenance and repair work performed at a dock area or within the port area.</p>

A disclosure by an ocean common carrier may not be deemed an admission or an agreement that any work is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. A dispute about whether any work is covered by a collective bargaining agreement and the responsibility of an ocean common carrier under a collective bargaining agreement shall be resolved solely in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures contained in the collective bargaining agreement and the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.), and without reference to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Effect under other laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subsection does not affect the lawfulness or unlawfulness under this part or any other Federal or State law of any collective bargaining agreement or element thereof, including any element that constitutes an essential term of a service contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Remedy for Breach</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Unless the parties agree otherwise, the exclusive remedy for a breach of a service contract is an action in an appropriate court. The contract dispute resolution forum may not be controlled by or in any way affiliated with a controlled carrier or by the government that owns or controls the carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Until a matter is referred to the Attorney General, the Federal Maritime Commission may, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, assess a civil penalty provided for in this part. The Commission may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, a civil penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Factors in Determining Amount</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining the amount of a civil penalty, the Commission shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation committed and, with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, history of prior offenses, ability to pay, and other matters justice may require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A civil penalty may not be imposed for conspiracy to violate section 41102(a) or 41104(1) or (2) of this title or to defraud the Commission by concealing such a violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Prohibited Basis of Penalty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Commission or a court may not order a person to pay the difference between the amount billed and agreed upon in writing with a common carrier or its agent and the amount set forth in a tariff or service contract by that common carrier for the transportation service provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Time Limit</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A proceeding to assess a civil penalty under this section must be commenced within 5 years after the date of the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Review of Civil Penalty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person against whom a civil penalty is assessed under this section may obtain review under chapter 158 of title 28.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Civil Actions To Collect</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a person does not pay an assessment of a civil penalty after it has become final or after the appropriate court has entered final judgment in favor of the Commission, the Attorney General at the request of the Commission may seek to collect the amount assessed in an appropriate district court of the United States. The court shall enforce the order of the Commission unless it finds that the order was not regularly made and duly issued.</p>

The action must be brought in the district court of the United States for any judicial district in which the defendant resides or transacts business. After notice to the defendant, and a showing that the standards for granting injunctive relief by courts of equity are met, the court may grant a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction for a period not to exceed 10 days after the Commission has issued an order disposing of the issues under investigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Reduction in Competition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Action by commission</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, at any time after the filing or effective date of an agreement under chapter 403 of this title, the Commission determines that the agreement is likely, by a reduction in competition, to produce an unreasonable reduction in transportation service or an unreasonable increase in transportation cost, the Commission, after notice to the person filing the agreement, may bring a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to enjoin the operation of the agreement. The Commission's sole remedy with respect to an agreement likely to have such an effect is an action under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Remedies by court</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In an action under this subsection, the court may issue&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a permanent injunction after a showing that the agreement is likely to have the effect described in paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall extend the period specified in section 40304(c)(2) of this title until there has been substantial compliance; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Representation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Commission may represent itself in a proceeding under this section in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a district court of the United States, on notice to the Attorney General; and</p>
