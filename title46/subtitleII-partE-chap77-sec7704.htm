<p class="note-body">Section 7704 requires the Secretary to revoke the license, certificate, or document of any individual who has been convicted of a dangerous drug law within 10 years before the beginning of the suspension or revocation procedures. This section has expanded current law to incorporate violations involving &ldquo;controlled substances&rdquo; which are not narcotic. This includes PCP and LSD. Unless it can be done under existing law, the suspension or revocation of an individual's license based on the use of a &ldquo;controlled substance&rdquo; only applies to the use or conviction after the date of enactment of this Act.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section also provides that anyone who has been a user of or addicted to a dangerous drug since July 14, 1954, may be subjected to revocation procedures unless the individual provides satisfactory proof of being cured.</p>
<p class="note-body">In sections 7503(b)(2) and 7704(c), the term &ldquo;use&rdquo;, when applying to &ldquo;narcotic drugs&rdquo; or &ldquo;controlled substances&rdquo;, is not intended to include the use of &ldquo;off the shelf&rdquo; drugs or drugs acquired with a prescription lawfully issued by a medical doctor, as long as the drugs are used by the individual in the recommended amounts and the drugs will not impair the individual's ability to perform duties.</p>
