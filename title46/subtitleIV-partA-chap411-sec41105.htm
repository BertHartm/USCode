<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) engage in any predatory practice designed to eliminate the participation, or deny the entry, in a particular trade of a common carrier not a member of the conference, a group of common carriers, an ocean tramp, or a bulk carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) negotiate with a non-ocean carrier or group of non-ocean carriers (such as truck, rail, or air operators) on any matter relating to rates or services provided to ocean common carriers within the United States by those non-ocean carriers, unless the negotiations and any resulting agreements are not in violation of the antitrust laws and are consistent with the purposes of this part, except that this paragraph does not prohibit the setting and publishing of a joint through rate by a conference, joint venture, or association of ocean common carriers;</p>

<p class="note-body">In paragraph (5), the words &ldquo;ocean freight forwarder&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;ocean transportation intermediary, as defined by section 1702(17)(A) of this Appendix&rdquo; because the definition of &ldquo;ocean transportation intermediary&rdquo; in section 1702(17)(A) contains a definition of &ldquo;ocean freight forwarder&rdquo; which is restated as a separate definition.</p>
