<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Issuance and Payment of Obligations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Section 53723 of this title applies to the OTEC Demonstration Fund.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;upon such terms as he shall prescribe&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because section 53702(a) of the revised title provides the Secretary authority to prescribe the terms. The text of 46 App. U.S.C. 1279c(a)(1) is omitted as obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f)(1), the words &ldquo;account established under section 53717(b)(1) of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Federal Ship Financing Fund&rdquo; because the accounts under section 53717 replace the Federal Ship Financing Fund. See the explanation for section 53717.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f)(2)(B), the word &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;conversional&rdquo; to correct an apparent error.</p>
