<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Applicability of Other Provisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as otherwise provided in this section, a guarantee or commitment to guarantee under this section is subject to all the provisions applicable to a guarantee or commitment to guarantee under subchapter I of this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Reasonableness of Risk</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A guarantee or commitment to guarantee may not be made under this section unless the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary, certifies to the Secretary that, for the facility or plantship for which the guarantee or commitment to guarantee is sought, there is sufficient guarantee of performance and payment to lower the risk to the United States Government to a reasonable level. In deciding whether to issue such a certification, the Secretary of Energy shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the successful demonstration of the technology to be used in the facility at a scale sufficient to establish the likelihood of technical and economic viability in the proposed market; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the need of the United States to develop new and renewable sources of energy and the benefits to be realized from the construction and successful operation of the facility or plantship.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>OTEC Demonstration Fund</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There is a special subaccount, known as the OTEC Demonstration Fund, in the account established under section 53717(b)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Use and operation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The OTEC Demonstration Fund shall be used for obligation guarantees authorized under this section that do not qualify under subchapter I of this chapter. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the OTEC Demonstration Fund shall be operated in the same manner as the parent account. However&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) amounts received by the Secretary under subchapter I of this chapter related to guarantees or commitments to guarantee made under this section shall be deposited only in the OTEC Demonstration Fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) when obligations issued by the Secretary under section 53723 of this title related to the OTEC Demonstration Fund are outstanding, any amount received by the Secretary under subchapter I of this chapter related to ocean thermal energy conversion facilities or plantships shall be deposited in the OTEC Demonstration Fund.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Transfers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Assets in the OTEC Demonstration Fund may be transferred to the parent account when and to the extent the balance in the OTEC Demonstration Fund exceeds the total guarantees or commitments to guarantee made under this section then outstanding, plus obligations issued by the Secretary under section 53723 of this title related to the OTEC Demonstration Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Liability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The parent account is not liable for a guarantee or commitment to guarantee made under this section.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Issuance and Payment of Obligations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Section 53723 of this title applies to the OTEC Demonstration Fund. However, obligations issued by the Secretary under that section related to the OTEC Demonstration Fund shall be payable only from proceeds realized by the OTEC Demonstration Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Taxation of Interest</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Interest on an obligation guaranteed under this section shall be included in gross income under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. ch. 1).</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;upon such terms as he shall prescribe&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because section 53702(a) of the revised title provides the Secretary authority to prescribe the terms. The text of 46 App. U.S.C. 1279c(a)(1) is omitted as obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f)(1), the words &ldquo;account established under section 53717(b)(1) of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Federal Ship Financing Fund&rdquo; because the accounts under section 53717 replace the Federal Ship Financing Fund. See the explanation for section 53717.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f)(2)(B), the word &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;conversional&rdquo; to correct an apparent error.</p>
