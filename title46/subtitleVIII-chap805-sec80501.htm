<p class="note-body">In the definition of &ldquo;international transport&rdquo;, subparagraphs (A) and (B) are substituted for 46 App. U.S.C. 1501(d)(1)&ndash;(3) to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;includes the lessee or bailee of a container if a written lease or bailment provides for the lessee or bailee to exercise the owner's responsibility for maintaining and examining the container&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;means a person who owns a container, or, if a written lease or bailment provides for the lessee or bailee to exercise the owner's responsibility for maintaining and examining the container, the lessee or bailee of a container, to the extent such agreement so provides&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">The definition of &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; is omitted because a complete reference to the appropriate Secretary is used the first time the Secretary is named in each section. Throughout this chapter, the phrase &ldquo;Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;Secretary of Transportation&rdquo; because the Coast Guard has been transferred to the Department of Homeland Security (except when operating as a service in the Navy) by section 888 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107&ndash;296, 116 Stat. 2249).</p>
<p class="note-body">The definition of &ldquo;United States&rdquo; is omitted because &ldquo;United States&rdquo; is defined in chapter 1 of the revised title. The definitions of &ldquo;new container&rdquo; and &ldquo;existing container&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete.</p>
