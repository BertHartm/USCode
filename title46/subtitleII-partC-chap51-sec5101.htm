<h4 class="note-sub-head"><em>Revised section 5101</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Source: Section (U.S. Code) 46 App. U.S.C. 86a.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 5101 contains definitions that are limited to Chapter 51&mdash;Load Lines. Existing Section 46 App. U.S.C. 86a (which defines only the terms &ldquo;new ship&rdquo; and &ldquo;existing ship&rdquo;) will be replaced by section 5101. Definitions of technical terms (&ldquo;freeboard&rdquo;, &ldquo;freeboard deck&rdquo;, and &ldquo;minimum safe freeboard&rdquo;) have been added for clarity. The definition of the term &ldquo;new ship&rdquo; has been deleted because the term is not used in Chapter 51. The definition of &ldquo;domestic voyage&rdquo; includes the phrase &ldquo;places in or subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.&rdquo; &ldquo;Places subject to the jurisdiction of the United States&rdquo; include deep water ports, production platforms, mining sites outside of territorial waters of the United States but within the United States&rsquo; Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) that was established by Presidential Proclamation 5030, dated March 10, 1983, or on the outer continental shelf. The phrases &ldquo;economic benefit of overloading&rdquo; and &ldquo;weight of the overload&rdquo; have been defined for purposes of establishing a standard method of determining the value of the cargo with which a vessel is overloaded. The value of the cargo will in turn affect the maximum penalty assessed for overloading the vessel. The definition of &ldquo;freeboard deck&rdquo; provides the Secretary with the authority to designate as the freeboard deck either the actual deck (on standard vessels) or another structure (on non-standard vessels). Non-standard vessels, for which this regulatory flexibility is necessary, include shelter deck vessels, semi-submersible multi-hull units, container ships, surface effect vessels, and commercial submarines.</p>
