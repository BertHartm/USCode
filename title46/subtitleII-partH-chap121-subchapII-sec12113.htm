<p class="note-body">The American Fisheries Act (Public Law 105&ndash;277, div. C, title II) (16 U.S.C. 1851 note), referred to in subsec. (d)(2)(B), probably should be a reference to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (see note below). Subsec. (d)(2)(B) of this section was derived from former section 12102(c)(5)(B) of this title in the general amendment of this chapter by Pub. L. 109&ndash;304, &sect;5, Oct. 6, 2006, 120 Stat. 1491. As part of that amendment, the reference to the American Fisheries Act was substituted for a reference to &ldquo;such Act&rdquo; which had been preceded by references to both of the above named Acts. See the Historical and Revision Notes above and section 2 of Pub. L. 109&ndash;304, set out as a Legislative Purpose and Construction note preceding section 101 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation Management Act, referred to in subsec. (g), probably means the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, Pub. L. 94&ndash;265, Apr. 13, 1976, 90 Stat. 331, which is classified principally to chapter 38 (&sect;1801 et seq.) of Title 16, Conservation. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 1801 of Title 16 and Tables.</p>
