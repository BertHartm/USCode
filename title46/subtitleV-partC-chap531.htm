(a) If the Secretary of the Navy certifies his approval under section 501(b) of this Act, and the Secretary of Transportation approves the application, he may secure bids for the construction of the proposed vessel according to the approved plans and specifications. If the bid of the shipbuilder who is the lowest responsible bidder is determined by the Secretary of Transportation to be fair and reasonable, the Secretary of Transportation may approve such bid, and if such approved bid is accepted by the proposed ship purchaser, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to enter into a contract with the successful bidder for the construction, outfitting, and equipment of the proposed vessel, and for the payment by the Secretary of Transportation to the shipbuilder, on terms to be agreed upon in the contract, of the contract price of the vessel, out of the construction fund hereinbefore referred to, or out of other available funds. Notwithstanding the provisions of the first sentence of section 505 of this Act with respect to competitive bidding, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to accept a price for the construction of the ship which has been negotiated between a shipyard and proposed ship purchaser if (1) the proposed ship purchaser and the shipyard submit backup cost details and evidence that the negotiated price is fair and reasonable; (2) the Secretary of Transportation finds that the negotiated price is fair and reasonable; and (3) the shipyard agrees that the Comptroller General of the United States or any of his duly authorized representatives shall, until the expiration of three years after final payment have access to and the right to examine any pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of the shipyard or any of its subcontractors related to the negotiation or performance of any contract or subcontract negotiated under this subsection and will include in its subcontracts a provision to that effect. Concurrently with entering into such contract with the shipbuilder, the Secretary of <!-- PDFPage:284 -->Transportation is authorized to enter into a contract for the sale of such vessel upon its completion, to the applicant if he is the proposed ship purchaser and if not to another citizen of the United States, if the Secretary of Transportation determines that such citizen possesses the ability, experience, financial resources, and other qualifications necessary for the operation and maintenance of the vessel at a price corresponding to the estimated cost, as determined by the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to the provisions of this Act [former 46 U.S.C. App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding section 101 of this title], of building such vessel in a foreign shipyard.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) The amount of the reduction in selling price which is herein termed &lsquo;construction differential subsidy&rsquo; shall equal, but not exceed, the excess of the bid of the shipbuilder constructing the proposed vessel (excluding the cost of any features incorporated in the vessel for national defense uses, which shall be paid by the Secretary in addition to the subsidy), over the fair and reasonable estimate of cost, as determined by the Secretary, of the construction of that type vessel if it were constructed under similar plans and specifications (excluding national defense features as above provided) in a foreign shipbuilding center which is deemed by the Secretary to furnish a fair and representative example for the determination of the estimated foreign cost of construction of vessels of the type proposed to be constructed. The Secretary of Transportation shall recompute such estimated foreign cost annually unless, in the opinion of the Secretary, there has been a significant change in shipbuilding market conditions. The Secretary shall publish notice of his intention to compute or recompute such estimated foreign cost and shall give interested persons, including but not limited to shipyards and shipowners and associations thereof, an opportunity to file written statements. The Secretary's consideration shall include, but not be limited to, all relevant matter so filed, and his determination shall include or be accompanied by a concise explanation of the basis of his determination. The construction differential approved and paid by the Secretary shall not exceed 50 per centum of the cost of constructing, reconstructing, or reconditioning the vessel (excluding the cost of national defense features). If the Secretary finds that the construction differential exceeds, in any case, the foregoing percentage of such cost, the Secretary may negotiate with any bidder (whether or not such person is the lowest bidder) and may contract with such bidder (notwithstanding the first sentence of section 505) for the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of the vessel involved in a domestic shipyard at a cost which will reduce the construction differential to such percentage or less. In the event that the Secretary has reason to believe that the bidding in any instance is collusive, he shall report all of the evidence on which he acted (1) to the Attorney General of the United States, and (2) to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of Representatives if the Congress shall be in session or if the Congress shall not be in session, then to the Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House, respectively.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) In such contract of sale between the purchaser and the Secretary of Transportation, the purchaser shall be required to make cash payments to the Secretary of Transportation of not less than 25 per centum of the price at which the vessel is sold to the purchaser. The cash payments shall be made at the time and in the same proportion as provided for the payments on account of the construction cost in the contract between the shipbuilder and the Secretary of Transportation. The purchaser shall pay, not less frequently than annually, interest on those portions of the Secretary of Transportation's payments as made to the shipbuilder which are chargeable to the purchaser's portion of the price of the vessel (after deduction of the purchaser's cash payments) at a rate not less than (i) a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, plus (ii) an allowance adequate in the judgment of the Secretary of Transportation to cover administrative costs. The balance of such purchase price shall be paid by the purchaser, within twenty-five years after delivery of the vessel and in not to exceed twenty-five equal annual installments, the first of which shall be payable one year after the delivery of the vessel by the Secretary of Transportation to the purchaser. Interest at the rate per annum applicable to payments that are chargeable to the purchaser's portion of the price of the vessel shall be paid on all such installments of the purchase price remaining unpaid.</p>

In such event the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to pay for any such vessel so constructed from his construction fund. The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to sell any vessel so constructed, outfitted, or equipped in a navy yard to a citizen of the United States for the fair and reasonable value thereof, but at not less than the cost thereof less the equivalent to the construction differential subsidy determined as provided by subsection (b), such sale to be in accordance with all the provisions of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(f) The Secretary of Transportation, with the advice of and in coordination with the Secretary of the Navy, shall at least once each year, as required for purposes of this Act, survey the existing privately owned shipyards capable of merchant ship construction, or review available data on such shipyards if deemed adequate, to determine whether their capabilities for merchant ship construction, including facilities and skilled personnel, provide an adequate mobilization base at strategic points for purposes of national defense and national emergency. The Secretary of Transportation, in connection with ship construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or remodeling under titles V and VII [former 46 U.S.C.

In the allocation of construction work to such yards as herein provided, the Secretary of Transportation may, after first obtaining competitive bids for such work in compliance with the provisions of this Act, negotiate with the bidders and with other shipbuilders concerning the terms and conditions of any contract for such work, and is authorized to enter into such contract at a price deemed by the Secretary of Transportation to be fair and reasonable.

If the vessel is constructed under section 509 the Secretary of Transportation shall reduce the price of the vessel by such excess, less one-half of any gross income (minus one-half of the extra expenses incurred to produce such gross income) the purchaser receives that is allocable to the delivery voyage. In the case of a vessel that is not to receive operating-differential subsidy, the delivery voyage shall be deemed terminated at the port where the vessel begins loading. In the case of a vessel that is to receive operating-differential subsidy, the delivery voyage shall be deemed terminated when the vessel begins loading at a United States port in an essential service. In either case, however, the vessel owner shall not be compensated for excess vessel delivery costs in an amount greater than the expenses that would have been incurred in delivering the vessel from the shipyard at which it was built to the shipyard of the lowest responsible bidder. If as a result of such allocation, the expenses the purchaser incurs with respect to such services are less than the expenses he would have incurred for such services if the vessel had been constructed by the lowest responsible bidder, the purchaser shall pay to the Secretary of Transportation an amount equal to such reduction and, if the vessel was built with the aid of construction-differential subsidy, such payment shall not be considered a reduction of the construction-differential subsidy.</p>

I74Subsidy Authorized for Operation of Vessels in Foreign Trade or in Off-Season Cruises<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 601. (a) The Secretary of Transportation is authorized and directed to consider the application of any citizen of the United States for financial aid in the operation of a vessel or vessels, which are to be used in an essential service in the foreign commerce of the United States or in such service and in cruises authorized under section 613 of this title. In this title VI the term &lsquo;essential service&rsquo; means the operation of a vessel on a service, route, or line described in section 211(a) [now 46 U.S.C. 50103(a)(1)] or in bulk cargo carrying service described in section 211(b) [now 46 U.S.C. 50103(b)]. No such application shall be approved by the Secretary of Transportation unless he determines that (1) the operation of such vessel or vessels in an essential service is required to meet foreign-flag competition and to promote the foreign commerce of the United States except to the extent such vessels are to be operated on cruises authorized under section 613 of this title, and that such vessel or vessels were built in the United States, or have been documented under the laws of the United States not later than February 1, 1928, or actually ordered and under construction for the account of citizens of the United States prior to such date; (2) the applicant owns, or leases or can and will build or purchase, or lease, a vessel or vessels of the size, type, speed, and number, and with the proper equipment required to enable him to operate in an essential service, in such manner as may be necessary to meet competitive conditions, and to promote foreign commerce; (3) the applicant possesses the ability, experience, financial resources, and other qualifications necessary to enable him to conduct the proposed operations of the vessel or vessels as to meet competitive conditions and promote foreign commerce; (4) the granting of the aid applied for is necessary to place the proposed operations of the vessel or vessels on a parity with those of foreign competitors, and is reasonably calculated to carry out effectively the purposes and policy of this Act [former 46 U.S.C. App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding section 101 of this title]. To the extent the application covers cruises, as authorized under section 613 of this title, the Secretary of Transportation may make the portion of this last determination relating to parity on the basis that any foreign flag cruise from the United States competes with any American flag cruise from the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) Every application for an operating-differential subsidy under the provisions of this title shall be accompanied by statements disclosing the names of all persons having any pecuniary interest, direct or indirect, in such application, or in the ownership or use of the vessel or vessels, routes, or lines covered thereby, and the nature and extent of any such interest, together with such financial and other statements as may be required by the Secretary of Transportation. All such statements shall be under oath or affirmation and in such form as the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe.

App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding section 101 of this title], as the Secretary of Transportation shall require to effectuate the purposes and policy of this Act, including a performance bond with approved sureties, if such bond is required by the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) Such contract shall provide, except as the parties should agree upon a lesser amount, that the amount of the operating-differential subsidy for the operation of vessels in an essential service shall equal the excess of the subsidizable wage costs of the United States officers and crews, the fair and reasonable cost of insurance, subsistence of officers and crews on passenger vessels, as defined in section 613 of this Act, maintenance, and repairs not compensated by insurance, incurred in the operation under United States registry of the vessel or vessels covered by the contract, over the estimated fair and reasonable cost of the same items of expense (after deducting therefrom any estimated increase in such items necessitated by features incorporated pursuant to the provisions of section 501(b) [set out above]) if such vessel or vessels were operated under the registry of a foreign country whose vessels are substantial competitors of the vessel or vessels covered by the contract: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the Secretary of Transportation may, with respect to any vessel in an essential bulk cargo carrying service as described in section 211(b) [now 46 U.S.C. 50103(b)], pay, in lieu of the operating-differential subsidy provided by this subsection (b), such sums as he shall determine to be necessary to make the cost of operating such vessel competitive with the cost of operating similar vessels under the registry of a foreign country. For any period during which a vessel cruises as authorized by section 613 of this Act, operating-differential subsidy shall be computed as though the vessel were operating on the essential service to which the vessel is assigned: <em>Provided, however</em>, That if the cruise vessel calls at a port or ports outside of its assigned service, but which is served with passenger vessels (as defined in section 613 of this Act) by another subsidized operator at an operating-differential subsidy rate for wages lower than the cruise vessel has on its assigned essential service, the operating-differential subsidy rates for each of the subsidizable items for each day (a fraction of a day to count as a day) that the vessel stops at such port shall be at the respective rates applicable to the subsidized operator regularly serving the area.</p>

In any subsequent base period the term &lsquo;base period costs&rsquo; means the average of the subsidizable wage cost of United States officers and crews for the preceding annual period ending June 30 (calculated without regard to the limitation of the last sentence of paragraph (D) of this subdivision but increased or decreased by the increase or decrease in the index described in subdivision (3) of this subsection from January 1 of such annual period to January 1 of the base period), and the collective-bargaining costs as of January 1 of the base period: <em>Provided</em>, That in no event shall the base period cost be such that the difference between the base period cost and the collective-bargaining costs as of January 1 of any base period subsequent to the first base period exceeds five-fourths of 1 per centum of the collective-bargaining costs as of such January 1 multiplied by the number of years that have elapsed since the most recent base period.</p>

The subsidizable wage costs of United States officers and crews in any period other than a base period shall not be less than 90 per centum of the collective-bargaining costs as of January 1 of such period nor greater than 110 per centum of such collective-bargaining costs.</p>

Such index shall consist of the average annual change in wages and benefits placed into effect for employees covered by collective-bargaining agreements with equal weight to be given to changes affecting employees in the transportation industry (excluding the offshore maritime industry) and to changes affecting employees in private nonagricultural industries other than transportation. Such index shall be based on the materials regularly used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in compiling its regularly published statistical series on wage and benefit changes arrived at through collective bargaining. Such materials shall remain confidential and not be subject to disclosure.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) Each foreign wage cost computation shall be made after an opportunity is given to the contractor to submit in writing and in timely fashion all relevant data within his possession. In making the computation, the Secretary shall consider all relevant matter so presented and all foreign wage cost data collected at his request or on his behalf. Such foreign cost data shall be <!-- PDFPage:290 -->made available to an interested contractor, unless the Secretary shall find that disclosure of the data will prevent him from obtaining such data in the future. In determining foreign manning for purposes of this section, the foreign manning determined for any ship type with respect to any base period shall not be redetermined until the beginning of a new base period.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) The wage subsidy shall be payable monthly for the voyages completed during the month, upon the contractor's certification that the subsidized vessels were in authorized service during the month.

The contractor and the Secretary of Transportation shall audit the voyage accounts as soon as practicable after such payment.
