<p class="note-body">Section 16 of the bill [H.R. 1442, which became Pub. L. 109&ndash;304] moves the definitions relating to the recreational boating safety program from section 2102(a)(1) and (3) to chapter 131 because the terms only appear in chapter 131.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 16 of the bill also eliminates the special definitions of &ldquo;State&rdquo; and &ldquo;United States&rdquo; in section 2102(a)(2) as including the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands because the Trust Territory has been terminated. See the definitions of &ldquo;State&rdquo; and &ldquo;United States&rdquo; in section 2101, which are being moved to chapter 1 and being made applicable title-wide. Those definitions already include the Northern Mariana Islands, the only component of the former Trust Territory still under United States sovereignty.</p>
