<h4 class="note-head">Review of Applications for Loans and Guarantees</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 110&ndash;181, div. C, title XXXV, &sect;3517, Jan. 28, 2008, 122 Stat. 595, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The maritime loan guarantee program was established by the Congress through the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 [see Short Title of 1936 Amendment <!-- PDFPage:337 -->note set out under section 101 of this title] to encourage domestic shipbuilding by making available federally backed loan guarantees for new construction to ship owners and operators.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The maritime loan guarantee program has a long and successful history of ship construction with a low historical default rate.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The current process for review of applications for maritime loans in the Department of Transportation has effectively discontinued the program as envisioned by the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The President has requested no funding for the loan guarantee program despite the stated national policy to foster the development and encourage the maintenance of a merchant marine in section 50101 of title 46, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) United States commercial shipyards were placed at a competitive disadvantage in the world shipbuilding market by government subsidized foreign commercial shipyards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The maritime loan guarantee program has the potential to modernize shipyards and the ships of the United States coastwise trade and restore a competitive position in the world shipbuilding market for United States shipyards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The maritime loan guarantee program is a useful tool to encourage domestic shipbuilding, preserving a vital industrial capacity critical to the security of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Requirements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act [Jan. 28, 2008], the Administrator of the Maritime Administration shall develop and implement a comprehensive plan for the review of applications for loan guarantees under chapter 537 of title 46, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Deadline for action on application.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) <cap-smallcap>Traditional applications</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the comprehensive plan the Administrator will ensure that within the 90-day period following receipt of all pertinent documentation required for review of a traditional loan application, the application shall be either accepted or rejected.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) <cap-smallcap>Nontraditional applications</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the comprehensive plan the Administrator will ensure that within the 180-day period following receipt of all pertinent documentation required for review of a nontraditional loan application, the application shall be either accepted or rejected.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Submission to Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall submit a copy of the comprehensive plan to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act [Jan. 28, 2008].</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Traditional application</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &lsquo;traditional application&rsquo; means an application for a loan, guarantee, or commitment to guarantee submitted pursuant to chapter 537 of title 46, United States Code, that involves a market, technology, and financial structure of a type that has proven successful in previous applications and does not present an unreasonable risk to the United States, as determined by the Administrator of the Maritime Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Nontraditional application</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &lsquo;nontraditional application&rsquo; means an application for a loan, guarantee, or commitment to guarantee submitted pursuant to chapter 537 of title 46, United States Code, that is not a traditional application, as determined by the Administrator of the Maritime Administration.&rdquo;</p>
