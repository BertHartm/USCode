<p class="note-body">In this section, the words &ldquo;department, agency, or instrumentality&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;department, board, bureau, or agency&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;the inspection of vessels&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the steamboat inspection service&rdquo; because the Steamboat Inspection Service has been abolished and its functions are now carried out by the Coast Guard.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;is authorized and directed&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
