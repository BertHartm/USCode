<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;privately-owned commercial vessel of the United States&rdquo; does not include a vessel that, after September 21, 1961, was built or rebuilt outside the United States or documented under the laws of a foreign country, until the vessel has been documented under the laws of the United States for at least 3 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Minimum Tonnage</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the United States Government procures, contracts for, or otherwise obtains for its own account, or furnishes to or for the account of a foreign country, organization, or persons without provision for reimbursement, any equipment, materials, or commodities, or provides financing in any way with Federal funds for the account of any persons unless otherwise exempted, within or without the United States, or advances funds or credits, or guarantees the convertibility of foreign currencies in connection with the furnishing or obtaining of the equipment, materials, or commodities, the appropriate agencies shall take steps necessary and practicable to ensure that at least 50 percent of the gross tonnage of the equipment, materials, or commodities (computed separately for dry bulk carriers, dry cargo liners, and tankers) which may be transported on ocean vessels is transported on privately-owned commercial vessels of the United States, to the extent those vessels are available at fair and reasonable rates for commercial vessels of the United States, in a manner that will ensure a fair and reasonable participation of commercial vessels of the United States in those cargoes by geographic areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Waivers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The President, the Secretary of Defense, or Congress (by concurrent resolution or otherwise) may waive this section temporarily by&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may impose on any person that violates this section, or a regulation prescribed under this section, a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 for each violation willfully and knowingly committed, with each day of a continuing violation following the date of shipment to be a separate violation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) may take other measures as appropriate under the Federal Acquisition Regulations issued pursuant to section 25(c)(1) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 421(c)(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#55305_1_target" name="55305_1">1</a></sup> or contract with respect to each violation.</p>
