<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words &ldquo;Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Secretary of Transportation&rdquo; because of the transfer of the Coast Guard to the Department of Homeland Security (except when operating as a service in the Navy) by section 888 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107&ndash;296, 116 Stat. 2249). See also sections 1 and 3 of title 14, as amended by section 1704(a) of such Act (116 Stat. 2314).</p>
