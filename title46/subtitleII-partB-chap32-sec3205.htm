L. 109&ndash;304, which directed the substitution of &ldquo;Secretary of Homeland Security shall withhold or revoke the clearance required by section 60105 of this title&rdquo; for &ldquo;Secretary of the Treasury shall withhold or revoke the clearance required by section 4197 of the Revised Statutes (46 App. U.S.C. 91)&rdquo;, was executed by making the substitution for text which included &ldquo;(46 U.S.C. App. 91)&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;(46 App. U.S.C. 91)&rdquo;, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.</p>
