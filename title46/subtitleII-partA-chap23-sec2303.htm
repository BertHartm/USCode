<p class="note-body">Section 2303 requires a master or anyone in charge of a vessel to provide assistance and render aid to those involved in a marine casualty and to exchange information in a manner similar to automobile accident cases. It also includes a &ldquo;Good Samaritan&rdquo; clause that exonerates anyone from liability when rendering assistance in an ordinary, reasonable, or prudent manner.</p>
