<p class="note-body">Section 31328(a) imposes limitations on issuing, assigning, or transferring instruments or evidence of indebtedness secured by a mortgage to a person not qualifying as a citizen of the United States under section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916, without setting up a trust. However, the trustee must be a State, the United States Government, a person approved by the Secretary as qualifying as a citizen of the United States, or any other person approved by the Secretary. This makes substantive changes to the law including broadening the types of persons that may be a trustee. In this section, the words &ldquo;or a substitute trustee&rdquo; have been deleted as unnecessary since the approval of a trustee inherently includes the approval of a substitute trustee.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 31328(b) requires the Secretary to approve the trustee if the person meets certain specific requirements listed in this subsection and the regulations prescribed under it.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 31328(c) allows the Secretary to disapprove a trustee if at any time the trustee does not meet the requirements of the Secretary and the prescribed regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 31328(d) prohibits a right under a mortgage of a documented vessel from being issued, assigned, or transferred to a person not eligible to be a mortgagee unless the Secretary approves of that issuance, assignment, or transfer.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:164 --><p class="note-body">Section 31328(e) prohibits a vessel from being operated by a trustee acting on behalf of foreign holders of indebtedness unless the trustee has the Secretary's approval.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 31328(f) voids any issuance, assignment, or transfer of an instrument of indebtedness that is contrary to this section. This subsection makes no substantive change to law.</p>
