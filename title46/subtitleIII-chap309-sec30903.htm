<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;civil action&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;proceeding&rdquo; and &ldquo;libel&rdquo; because of rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.) and for consistency in the chapter. The words &ldquo;civil action in admiralty in personam&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;any appropriate nonjury proceeding in personam&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;in rem or in personam in any district&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;admiralty claim&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;cross libel&rdquo; for consistency in this chapter and with the various means of asserting a claim (such as by counterclaim or cross-claim) allowed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The words &ldquo;with the same force and effect as if the libel had been filed by a private party&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is substituted for the word &ldquo;nonjury&rdquo; to clarify that the nonjury requirement applies to any claim against the United States or a federally-owned corporation under this section regardless of which party brings the action.</p>
