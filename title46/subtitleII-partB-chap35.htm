<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 111&ndash;207, &sect;2, July 27, 2010, 124 Stat. 2243, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) There are approximately 200 overnight ocean-going cruise vessels worldwide. The average ocean-going cruise vessel carries 2,000 passengers with a crew of 950 people.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In 2007 alone, approximately 12,000,000 passengers were projected to take a cruise worldwide.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Passengers on cruise vessels have an inadequate appreciation of their potential vulnerability to crime while on ocean voyages, and those who may be victimized lack the information they need to understand their legal rights or to know whom to contact for help in the immediate aftermath of the crime.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:61 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Sexual violence, the disappearance of passengers from vessels on the high seas, and other serious crimes have occurred during luxury cruises.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Over the last 5 years, sexual assault and physical assaults on cruise vessels were the leading crimes investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation with regard to cruise vessel incidents.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) These crimes at sea can involve attacks both by passengers and crewmembers on other passengers and crewmembers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Except for United States flagged vessels, or foreign flagged vessels operating in an area subject to the direct jurisdiction of the United States, there are no Federal statutes or regulations that explicitly require cruise lines to report alleged crimes to United States Government officials.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) It is not known precisely how often crimes occur on cruise vessels or exactly how many people have disappeared during ocean voyages because cruise line companies do not make comprehensive, crime-related data readily available to the public.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Obtaining reliable crime-related cruise data from governmental sources can be difficult, because multiple countries may be involved when a crime occurs on the high seas, including the flag country for the vessel, the country of citizenship of particular passengers, and any countries having special or maritime jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) It can be difficult for professional crime investigators to immediately secure an alleged crime scene on a cruise vessel, recover evidence of an onboard offense, and identify or interview potential witnesses to the alleged crime.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Most cruise vessels that operate into and out of United States ports are registered under the laws of another country, and investigations and prosecutions of crimes against passengers and crewmembers may involve the laws and authorities of multiple nations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) The Department of Homeland Security has found it necessary to establish 500-yard security zones around cruise vessels to limit the risk of terrorist attack. Recently piracy has dramatically increased throughout the world.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) To enhance the safety of cruise passengers, the owners of cruise vessels could upgrade, modernize, and retrofit the safety and security infrastructure on such vessels by installing peep holes in passenger room doors, installing security video cameras in targeted areas, limiting access to passenger rooms to select staff during specific times, and installing acoustic hailing and warning devices capable of communicating over distances.&rdquo;</p>
