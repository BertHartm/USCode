<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;February 28 of each year&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;February 28, 1987, and annually thereafter&rdquo; in 46 App. U.S.C. 1802 to eliminate obsolete language. The words &ldquo;Beginning with the first report submitted under this section after the date of enactment of the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;To the extent practicable, the reports required under sections 903, 905, and 907 [46 App. U.S.C. 1801 note, 1802, 1803] shall be consolidated into a single document before being submitted to the Congress&rdquo; in 46 App. U.S.C. 1809(a) are omitted as unnecessary and obsolete because sections 903 and 907 are being omitted from the revised title and repealed as obsolete.
