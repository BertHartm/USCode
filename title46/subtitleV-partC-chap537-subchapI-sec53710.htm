<p class="note-body">During review of this bill, the American Bureau of Shipping, through counsel, explained that it disagrees with an existing interpretation by the Maritime Administration of language restated in subsection (a)(4)(A) of this section, and requested the Committee <!-- PDFPage:323 -->to clarify that this codification should not be construed as a ratification of that regulatory interpretation. The Committee therefore states that this codification should not be construed as an expression of any opinion whatsoever concerning any such administrative interpretation.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(3), the words &ldquo;subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this section&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(4)(B), the words &ldquo;well equipped, in good repair, and in every respect seaworthy and fit for service&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;tight, stanch, strong, and well and sufficiently tackled, appareled, furnished, and equipped, and in every respect seaworthy and in good running condition and repair, and in all respects fit for service&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the reference to section 503 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, is substituted for the reference to &ldquo;subchapter V of this chapter&rdquo; because the relevant characteristics referred to in the text are contained in that section and because that section is part of the construction-differential subsidy program, which is not being restated.</p>
