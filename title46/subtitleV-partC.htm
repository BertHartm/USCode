<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 502. (a) If the Secretary of the Navy certifies his approval under section 501(b) of this Act, and the Secretary of Transportation approves the application, he may secure bids for the construction of the proposed vessel according to the approved plans and specifications. If the bid of the shipbuilder who is the lowest responsible bidder is determined by the Secretary of Transportation to be fair and reasonable, the Secretary of Transportation may approve such bid, and if such approved bid is accepted by the proposed ship purchaser, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to enter into a contract with the successful bidder for the construction, outfitting, and equipment of the proposed vessel, and for the payment by the Secretary of Transportation to the shipbuilder, on terms to be agreed upon in the contract, of the contract price of the vessel, out of the construction fund hereinbefore referred to, or out of other available funds. Notwithstanding the provisions of the first sentence of section 505 of this Act with respect to competitive bidding, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to accept a price for the construction of the ship which has been negotiated between a shipyard and proposed ship purchaser if (1) the proposed ship purchaser and the shipyard submit backup cost details and evidence that the negotiated price is fair and reasonable; (2) the Secretary of Transportation finds that the negotiated price is fair and reasonable; and (3) the shipyard agrees that the Comptroller General of the United States or any of his duly authorized representatives shall, until the expiration of three years after final payment have access to and the right to examine any pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of the shipyard or any of its subcontractors related to the negotiation or performance of any contract or subcontract negotiated under this subsection and will include in its subcontracts a provision to that effect. Concurrently with entering into such contract with the shipbuilder, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to enter into a contract for the sale of such vessel upon its completion, to the applicant if he is the proposed ship purchaser and if not to another citizen of the United States, if the Secretary of Transportation determines that such citizen possesses the ability, experience, financial resources, and other qualifications necessary for the operation and maintenance of the vessel at a price corresponding to the estimated cost, as determined by the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to the provisions of this Act [former 46 U.S.C. App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding section 101 of this title], of building such vessel in a foreign shipyard.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) The amount of the reduction in selling price which is herein termed &lsquo;construction differential subsidy&rsquo; shall equal, but not exceed, the excess of the bid of the shipbuilder constructing the proposed vessel (excluding the cost of any features incorporated in the vessel for national defense uses, which shall be paid by the Secretary in addition to the subsidy), over the fair and reasonable estimate of cost, as determined by the Secretary, of the construction of that type vessel if it were constructed under similar plans and specifications (excluding national defense features as above provided) in a foreign shipbuilding center which is deemed by the Secretary to furnish a fair and representative example for the determination of the estimated foreign cost of construction of vessels of the type proposed to be constructed. The Secretary of Transportation shall recompute such estimated foreign cost annually unless, in the opinion of the Secretary, there has been a significant change in shipbuilding market conditions. The Secretary shall publish notice of his intention to compute or recompute such estimated foreign cost and shall give interested persons, including but not limited to shipyards and shipowners and associations thereof, an opportunity to file written statements. The Secretary's consideration shall include, but not be limited to, all relevant matter so filed, and his determination shall include or be accompanied by a concise explanation of the basis of his determination. The construction differential approved and paid by the Secretary shall not exceed 50 per centum of the cost of constructing, reconstructing, or reconditioning the vessel (excluding the cost of national defense features). If the Secretary finds that the construction differential exceeds, in any case, the foregoing percentage of such cost, the Secretary may negotiate with any bidder (whether or not such person is the lowest bidder) and may contract with such bidder (notwithstanding the first sentence of section 505) for the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of the vessel involved in a domestic shipyard at a cost which will reduce the construction differential to such percentage or less. In the event that the Secretary has reason to believe that the bidding in any instance is collusive, he shall report all of the evidence on which he acted (1) to the Attorney General of the United States, and (2) to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of Representatives if the Congress shall be in session or if the Congress shall not be in session, then to the Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House, respectively.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) In such contract of sale between the purchaser and the Secretary of Transportation, the purchaser shall be required to make cash payments to the Secretary of Transportation of not less than 25 per centum of the price at which the vessel is sold to the purchaser. The cash payments shall be made at the time and in the same proportion as provided for the payments on account of the construction cost in the contract between the shipbuilder and the Secretary of Transportation. The purchaser shall pay, not less frequently than annually, interest on those portions of the Secretary of Transportation's payments as made to the shipbuilder which are chargeable to the purchaser's portion of the price of the vessel (after deduction of the purchaser's cash payments) at a rate not less than (i) a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, plus (ii) an allowance adequate in the judgment of the Secretary of Transportation to cover administrative costs. The balance of such purchase price shall be paid by the purchaser, within twenty-five years after delivery of the vessel and in not to exceed twenty-five equal annual installments, the first of which shall be payable one year after the delivery of the vessel by the Secretary of Transportation to the purchaser. Interest at the rate per annum applicable to payments that are chargeable to the purchaser's portion of the price of the vessel shall be paid on all such installments of the purchase price remaining unpaid.</p>

The Secretary of Transportation, in connection with ship construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or remodeling under titles V and VII [former 46 U.S.C.

If the vessel is constructed under section 509 the Secretary of Transportation shall reduce the price of the vessel by such excess, less one-half of any gross income (minus one-half of the extra expenses incurred to produce such gross income) the purchaser receives that is allocable to the delivery voyage. In the case of a vessel that is not to receive operating-differential subsidy, the delivery voyage shall be deemed terminated at the port where the vessel begins loading. In the case of a vessel that is to receive operating-differential subsidy, the delivery voyage shall be deemed terminated when the vessel begins loading at a United States port in an essential service. In either case, however, the vessel owner shall not be compensated for excess vessel delivery costs in an amount greater than the expenses that would have been incurred in delivering the vessel from the shipyard at which it was built to the shipyard of the lowest responsible bidder. If as a result of such allocation, the expenses the purchaser incurs with respect to such services are less than the expenses he would have incurred for such services if the vessel had been constructed by the lowest responsible bidder, the purchaser shall pay to the Secretary of Transportation an amount equal to such reduction and, if the vessel was built with the aid of construction-differential subsidy, such payment shall not be considered a reduction of the construction-differential subsidy.</p>

(a) The Secretary of Transportation is authorized and directed to consider the application of any citizen of the United States for financial aid in the operation of a vessel or vessels, which are to be used in an essential service in the foreign commerce of the United States or in such service and in cruises authorized under section 613 of this title. In this title VI the term &lsquo;essential service&rsquo; means the operation of a vessel on a service, route, or line described in section 211(a) [now 46 U.S.C. 50103(a)(1)] or in bulk cargo carrying service described in section 211(b) [now 46 U.S.C. 50103(b)]. No such application shall be approved by the Secretary of Transportation unless he determines that (1) the operation of such vessel or vessels in an essential service is required to meet foreign-flag competition and to promote the foreign commerce of the United States except to the extent such vessels are to be operated on cruises authorized under section 613 of this title, and that such vessel or vessels were built in the United States, or have been documented under the laws of the United States not later than February 1, 1928, or actually ordered and under construction for the account of citizens of the United States prior to such date; (2) the applicant owns, or leases or can and will build or purchase, or lease, a vessel or vessels of the size, type, speed, and number, and with the proper equipment required to enable him to operate in an essential service, in such manner as may be necessary to meet competitive conditions, and to promote foreign commerce; (3) the applicant possesses the ability, experience, financial resources, and other qualifications necessary to enable him to conduct the proposed operations of the vessel or vessels as to meet competitive conditions and promote foreign commerce; (4) the granting of the aid applied for is necessary to place the proposed operations of the vessel or vessels on a parity with those of foreign competitors, and is reasonably calculated to carry out effectively the purposes and policy of this Act [former 46 U.S.C. App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding section 101 of this title]. To the extent the application covers cruises, as authorized under section 613 of this title, the Secretary of Transportation may make the portion of this last determination relating to parity on the basis that any foreign flag cruise from the United States competes with any American flag cruise from the United States.</p>

(a) If the Secretary of Transportation approves the application, he may enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of an operating-differential subsidy determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, for the operation of such vessel or vessels in an essential service and in cruises authorized under section 613 of this title for a period not exceeding twenty years, and subject to such reasonable terms and conditions, consistent with this Act [former 46 U.S.C. App. 1101 et seq., see Disposition Table preceding section 101 of this title], as the Secretary of Transportation shall require to effectuate the purposes and policy of this Act, including a performance bond with approved sureties, if such bond is required by the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) Such contract shall provide, except as the parties should agree upon a lesser amount, that the amount of the operating-differential subsidy for the operation of vessels in an essential service shall equal the excess of the subsidizable wage costs of the United States officers and crews, the fair and reasonable cost of insurance, subsistence of officers and crews on passenger vessels, as defined in section 613 of this Act, maintenance, and repairs not compensated by insurance, incurred in the operation under United States registry of the vessel or vessels covered by the contract, over the estimated fair and reasonable cost of the same items of expense (after deducting therefrom any estimated increase in such items necessitated by features incorporated pursuant to the provisions of section 501(b) [set out above]) if such vessel or vessels were operated under the registry of a foreign country whose vessels are substantial competitors of the vessel or vessels covered by the contract: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the Secretary of Transportation may, with respect to any vessel in an essential bulk cargo carrying service as described in section 211(b) [now 46 U.S.C. 50103(b)], pay, in lieu of the operating-differential subsidy provided by this subsection (b), such sums as he shall determine to be necessary to make the cost of operating such vessel competitive with the cost of operating similar vessels under the registry of a foreign country. For any period during which a vessel cruises as authorized by section 613 of this Act, operating-differential subsidy shall be computed as though the vessel were operating on the essential service to which the vessel is assigned: <em>Provided, however</em>, That if the cruise vessel calls at a port or ports outside of its assigned service, but which is served with passenger vessels (as defined in section 613 of this Act) by another subsidized operator at an operating-differential subsidy rate for wages lower than the cruise vessel has on its assigned essential service, the operating-differential subsidy rates for each of the subsidizable items for each day (a fraction of a day to count as a day) that the vessel stops at such port shall be at the respective rates applicable to the subsidized operator regularly serving the area.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c)(1) When used in this section&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(i) the officers or members of the crew that the Secretary of Transportation has found, prior to the award of a contract for the construction or reconstruction of a vessel, to be unnecessary for the efficient and economical operation of such vessel: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary of Transportation shall afford representatives of the collective-bargaining unit or units responsible for the manning of the vessel an opportunity to comment on such finding prior to the effective date of such finding: <em>And provided further</em>, That in determining whether officers or members of the crew are necessary for the efficient and economical operation of such vessel, the Secretary of Transportation shall give due consideration to, but shall not be bound by, wage and manning scales and working conditions required by a bona fide collective-bargaining agreement, or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(ii) those officers or members of the crew that the Secretary of Transportation has found, prior to ninety days following the date of enactment of this subsection [Oct. 21, 1970], to be unnecessary for the efficient and economical operation of the vessel.</p>

In any subsequent base period the term &lsquo;base period costs&rsquo; means the average of the subsidizable wage cost of United States officers and crews for the preceding annual period ending June 30 (calculated without regard to the limitation of the last sentence of paragraph (D) of this subdivision but increased or decreased by the increase or decrease in the index described in subdivision (3) of this subsection from January 1 of such annual period to January 1 of the base period), and the collective-bargaining costs as of January 1 of the base period: <em>Provided</em>, That in no event shall the base period cost be such that the difference between the base period cost and the collective-bargaining costs as of January 1 of any base period subsequent to the first base period exceeds five-fourths of 1 per centum of the collective-bargaining costs as of such January 1 multiplied by the number of years that have elapsed since the most recent base period.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(D) The term &lsquo;subsidizable wage costs of United States officers and crews&rsquo; in any period other than a base period means the most recent base period costs increased or decreased by the increase or decrease from January 1 of such base period to January 1 of such period in the index described in subdivision (3) hereof, and with respect to a base period means the base period cost. The subsidizable wage costs of United States officers and crews in any period other than a base period shall not be less than 90 per centum of the collective-bargaining costs as of January 1 of such period nor greater than 110 per centum of such collective-bargaining costs.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) The Secretary of Transportation shall determine the collective-bargaining costs on ships in subsidized operation as of January 1, 1971, and as of each January 1 thereafter, and shall as of intervals of not less than two years nor more than four years, establish a new base period cost, except that the Secretary shall not establish a new base period unless he announces his intention to do so prior to the December 31 that would be included in the new base period.</p>

Such index shall consist of the average annual change in wages and benefits placed into effect for employees covered by collective-bargaining agreements with equal weight to be given to changes affecting employees in the transportation industry (excluding the offshore maritime industry) and to changes affecting employees in private nonagricultural industries other than transportation. Such index shall be based on the materials regularly used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in compiling its regularly published statistical series on wage and benefit changes arrived at through collective bargaining. Such materials shall remain confidential and not be subject to disclosure.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) Each foreign wage cost computation shall be made after an opportunity is given to the contractor to submit in writing and in timely fashion all relevant data within his possession. In making the computation, the Secretary shall consider all relevant matter so presented and all foreign wage cost data collected at his request or on his behalf. Such foreign cost data shall be made available to an interested contractor, unless the Secretary shall find that disclosure of the data will prevent him from obtaining such data in the future. In determining foreign manning for purposes of this section, the foreign manning determined for any ship type with respect to any base period shall not be redetermined until the beginning of a new base period.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) The wage subsidy shall be payable monthly for the voyages completed during the month, upon the contractor's certification that the subsidized vessels were in authorized service during the month. The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe procedures for the calculation and payment of subsidy on items of expense which are included in &lsquo;collective-bargaining costs&rsquo; but are not included in the daily rate because they are unpredictably timed.</p>

The contractor and the Secretary of Transportation shall audit the voyage accounts as soon as practicable after such payment.

<p class="note-body">In paragraph (4)(B), the words &ldquo;become or remain&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;be placed under or continued to be&rdquo; for clarity.</p>

Citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands became citizens or non-citizen nationals of the United States (either of which is a &ldquo;citizen of the United States&rdquo; as defined in chapter 1 of the revised title) when the Covenant establishing the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands became effective on November 4, 1986.</p>

<p class="note-body">In paragraph (8), before subparagraph (A), the words &ldquo;instrument of indebtedness&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;note, bond, debenture, or other evidence of indebtedness&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. In subparagraph (B), the reference to section 53717 is substituted for the reference to 46 App. U.S.C. 1272 because the accounts under section 53717 replace the Federal Ship Financing Fund.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The maritime loan guarantee program has a long and successful history of ship construction with a low historical default rate.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The current process for review of applications for maritime loans in the Department of Transportation has effectively discontinued the program as envisioned by the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The President has requested no funding for the loan guarantee program despite the stated national policy to foster the development and encourage the maintenance of a merchant marine in section 50101 of title 46, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) United States commercial shipyards were placed at a competitive disadvantage in the world shipbuilding market by government subsidized foreign commercial shipyards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The maritime loan guarantee program has the potential to modernize shipyards and the ships of the United States coastwise trade and restore a competitive position in the world shipbuilding market for United States shipyards.</p>

The Committee therefore states that this codification should not be construed as an expression of any opinion whatsoever concerning any such administrative interpretation.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(3), the words &ldquo;subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this section&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the reference to section 503 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, is substituted for the reference to &ldquo;subchapter V of this chapter&rdquo; because the relevant characteristics referred to in the text are contained in that section and because that section is part of the construction-differential subsidy program, which is not being restated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the proceeds of an obligation guaranteed under this chapter are to be used to finance the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of a vessel that will serve as security for a guarantee under this chapter, the Secretary or Administrator may accept and hold in escrow, under an escrow agreement with the obligor, a portion of the proceeds of all obligations guaranteed under this chapter whose proceeds are to be so used which is equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the principal amount of all obligations whose proceeds are to be so used; over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 75 percent or 87.5 percent, whichever is applicable under section 53709(b) of this title, of the amount paid by or for the account of the obligor for the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of the vessel; plus</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any interest the Secretary or Administrator may require on the amount described in paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Security Involving Both Uncompleted and Delivered Vessels</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the security for the <!-- PDFPage:349 -->guarantee of an obligation relates both to a vessel to be constructed, reconstructed, or reconditioned and to a delivered vessel, the principal amount of the obligation shall be prorated for purposes of subsection (a) under regulations prescribed by the Secretary or Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Disbursement Before Termination of Agreement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) redeem the obligations under a refinancing guaranteed under this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) pay any excess interest deposits to the obligor at times provided for in the escrow agreement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

If the aggregate actual cost of the vessel has increased since the Secretary's or Administrator's initial approval or if it increases after the first disbursement is permitted under this subsection, then no further disbursements shall be made under subsection (c) until the total amount paid by or for the account of the obligor from sources other than the proceeds of the obligation equals at least 25 percent or 12.5 percent, as applicable, of the increase, as determined by the Secretary or Administrator, in the aggregate actual cost of the vessel. This paragraph does not require the Secretary or Administrator to consent to finance any increase in actual cost unless the Secretary or Administrator determines that such an increase in the obligation meets all the terms and conditions of this chapter or other applicable law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Documented proof of progress requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary or Administrator shall, by regulation, establish a transparent, independent, and risk-based process for verifying and documenting the progress of projects under construction before disbursing guaranteed loan funds. At a minimum, the process shall require documented proof of progress in connection with the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of a vessel or vessels before disbursements are made from the escrow fund. The Secretary or Administrator may require that the obligor provide a certificate from an independent party certifying that the requisite progress in construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning has taken place.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Disbursement on Termination of Agreement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a payment has not become due under the guarantee before the termination of the escrow agreement, the balance of the escrow fund at the time of termination shall be disbursed to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) prepay the excess of&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Applicable Terms</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel in accordance with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the terms applicable under this chapter for vessels documented under the laws of the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) other terms the Administrator determines are more favorable than those terms and compatible with export credit terms offered by foreign governments for the sale of vessels built in foreign shipyards.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Interagency Council</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Establishment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There is an interagency council to carry out this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Composition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The council is composed of the following individuals or their designees:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The Administrator, who is the chairman of the council.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The Secretary of State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The United States Trade Representative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) The President and Chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Functions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The council shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) obtain information on shipbuilding loan guarantees, direct and indirect subsidies, and other favorable treatment of shipyards provided by foreign governments to shipyards in competition with United States shipyards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) consult regularly with United States shipbuilders to obtain the essential information about international shipbuilding competition on which to set terms for loan guarantees under subsection (a)(2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provide guidance to the Administrator in establishing terms for loan guarantees under subsection (a)(2).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Annual report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than January 31 of each year, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report on activities of the Administrator under this section during the preceding year. The report shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) documentation of sources of information about assistance by governments of other countries to shipyards in those countries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a summary of recommendations made to the Administrator during the preceding year about applications submitted to the Administrator during that year for loan guarantees to construct eligible export vessels.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Required Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Benefit to shipbuilding industry</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may not guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel unless the Administrator finds that the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of the vessel will aid in the transition of United States shipyards to commercial activities or will preserve shipbuilding assets that would be essential in time of war or national emergency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Priority of documented vessels</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may not make a commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel unless the Administrator determines that making the commitment will not result in denial of an economically sound application for a commitment to guarantee an obligation for a vessel documented under the laws of the United States and operating in the domestic or foreign commerce of the United States. The Administrator has sole discretion in making the determination. In making the determination, the Administrator shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the status and economic soundness of pending applications for commitments to guarantee obligations for vessels documented under the laws of the United States that are operating or will be operating in the domestic or foreign commerce of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of guarantee authority available.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Restriction on Transfer of Vessel</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may not guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel unless the owner of the vessel agrees with the Administrator that the vessel will not be transferred to a country designated by the Secretary of Defense as a country whose interests are hostile to the interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Review by Secretary of Defense</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Notification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall promptly notify the Secretary of Defense of the receipt of an application for a loan guarantee for an eligible export vessel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Disapproval</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense, within 30 days after receiving the notice, may disapprove the guarantee based on an assessment of the potential use of the vessel in a manner that may harm the national security interests of the United States. The Secretary of Defense may not disapprove a guarantee solely because of the type of vessel to be constructed.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:357 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Delegation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority of the Secretary of Defense to disapprove a guarantee under this subsection may be delegated only to a civilian officer of the Department of Defense appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may not make a loan guarantee disapproved by the Secretary of Defense under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Expiration of Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may not issue a commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel under this chapter after the last date on which such a commitment may be issued under any treaty or convention entered into after November 30, 1993, that prohibits guarantee of such an obligation.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (f), the source provides that the authority to issue commitments to guarantee obligations for eligible export vessels expires after the later of three events. The first event, which is &ldquo;(A) the 5th anniversary of the date on which the Secretary publishes final regulations setting forth the application procedures for the issuance of commitments to guarantee obligations for eligible export vessels&rdquo;, is omitted because the final regulations were published on September 16, 1994. See 59 Fed. Reg. 47548. The second event, which is &ldquo;(B) the last day of any 5-year period in which funding and guarantee authority for obligations for eligible export vessels have been continuously available&rdquo;, is omitted because that date was November 11, 1998, five years after enactment of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1994 (Pub.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If there is a disagreement about a loss insured under this chapter, a civil action in admiralty may be brought against the United States in the district court of the United States for the district in which the plaintiff or the plaintiff's agent resides. If the plaintiff has no residence in the United States, the action may be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the district court for any district in which the Attorney General agrees to accept service. Any person who may have an interest in the insurance may be made a party, either initially or on the motion of either party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Exclusive Remedy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A civil action against the United States under this section is exclusive of any other action by reason of the same subject matter against an officer, employee, or agent employed or retained by the Government under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Procedure</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A civil action under this section shall be heard and determined under chapter 309 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Tolling of Limitations Period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a claim is filed with the Secretary of Transportation, the running of the limitations period for bringing a civil action is suspended until the Secretary denies the claim, and for 60 days thereafter. The Secretary is deemed to have denied the claim if the Secretary does not act on the claim within 6 months after the claim is filed, unless the Secretary for good cause shown agrees with the claimant on a different period for the Secretary to act on the claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Interpleader</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary acknowledges the indebtedness of the Government under the insurance and there is a dispute about the persons entitled to receive payment, the Government may bring a civil action interpleading those persons. The action shall be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the district court for the district in which any of those persons resides. A person not residing or found in the district may be made a party by service in any reasonable manner the court directs. If the court is satisfied that unknown persons might make a claim under the insurance, the court may direct service on those unknown persons by publication in the Federal Register. Judgment after service by publication in the Federal Register discharges the Government from further liability to all persons.</p>
