<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a productive and healthy agricultural industry and a strong and active United States maritime industry are vitally important to the economic well-being and security of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) both industries must compete in international markets increasingly dominated by foreign trade barriers and the subsidization practices of foreign governments; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) increased agricultural exports and the use of merchant vessels of the United States contribute positively to the United States balance of trade and generate employment opportunities in the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this subchapter are to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) enable the Secretary of Agriculture to plan export programs effectively, by clarifying the ocean transportation requirements applicable to those programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) take immediate and positive steps to promote the growth of the cargo-carrying capacity of the United States merchant marine;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) expand international trade in United States agricultural commodities and products and develop, maintain, and expand markets for United States agricultural exports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) improve the efficiency of administration of both the commodity purchasing and selling activities and the ocean transportation activities associated with export programs sponsored by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) stimulate and promote the agricultural and maritime industries of the United States and encourage cooperative efforts by both industries to address their common problems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) provide for the appropriate disposition of these findings and purposes.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Applicable Export Activity</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section applies to export activity (except inspection or weighing activities, other activities carried out for health or safety, or technical assistance provided in the handling of commercial transactions) of the Secretary of Agriculture or the Commodity Credit Corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) carried out under the Food for Peace Act (7 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) carried out under section 416 of the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1431);</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Additional Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Application of section 55305</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The requirement for transportation on vessels of the United States under subsection (a) is subject to the same terms and conditions as provided in section 55305 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Allocation of commodities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to paragraph (3), in carrying out this section and section 55305 of this title, the Corporation shall take steps necessary and practicable, and consistent with this section and section 55305, without detriment to any port range to allocate, on the principle of lowest landed cost without regard to the country of registry of the vessel, 25 percent of the bagged, processed, or fortified commodities provided under title II of the Food for Peace Act (7 U.S.C. 1721 et seq.).</p>

The requirements for transportation on vessels of the United States under this section and section 55305 of this title do not apply to commodities allocated to the Great Lakes port range under paragraph (2). Commodities allocated to the Great Lakes port range under paragraph (2) may not be reallocated or diverted to another port range to meet those requirements to the extent that the total tonnage of commodities to which paragraph (2) applies that is furnished and transported from the Great Lakes port range is less than 25 percent of the total annual tonnage of the commodities furnished.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may not deny award of the contract to a person based on the type of vessel on which the transportation would be provided (including on the basis that the transportation would not be provided on a liner vessel, as that term is used in the Shipping Act of 1984, as in effect on November 14, 1995), if the person otherwise satisfies reasonable requirements for financial and operational integrity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Nonavailability of vessels</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A determination of nonavailability of vessels of the United States resulting from the application of this subsection may not reduce the gross tonnage of commodities required by this section and section 55305 of this title to be transported on vessels of the United States.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Commodities shipped from inventory</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this subsection, commodities shipped from the inventory of the Corporation shall be valued as provided in section 412(d) of the Food for Peace Act (7 U.S.C. 1736f(d)).</p>
