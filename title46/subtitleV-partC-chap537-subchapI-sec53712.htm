<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall monitor the financial condition and operations of the obligor on a regular basis during the term of the guarantee. The Secretary shall document the results of the monitoring on an annual or quarterly basis depending on the condition of the obligor. If the Secretary determines that the financial condition of the obligor warrants additional protections to the Secretary, the Secretary shall take appropriate action under subsection (b). If the Secretary determines that the financial condition of the obligor jeopardizes its continued ability to perform its responsibilities in connection with the guarantee of an obligation by the Secretary, the Secretary shall make an immediate determination whether default should take place and whether further measures described in subsection (b) should be taken to protect the interests of the Secretary while ensuring that program objectives are met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Contract Provisions To Protect Secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall include provisions in a loan agreement with an obligor that provides additional authority to the Secretary to take action to limit potential losses in connection with a defaulted loan or a loan that is in jeopardy due to the deteriorating financial condition of the obligor. These provisions include requirements for additional collateral or greater equity contributions that are effective upon the occurrence of verifiable conditions relating to the obligor's financial condition or the status of the vessel or shipyard project.</p>
