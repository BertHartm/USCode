<p class="note-body">In this section, the tax rates for fiscal years 1991 through 2002 are omitted as obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1), the words &ldquo;West Indies Islands&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;West India Islands&rdquo; to conform to current geographic terminology. The word &ldquo;Newfoundland&rdquo; is omitted because Newfoundland is now part of Canada.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2), the reference to the definitions in section 2101 is confined to &ldquo;recreational vessel&rdquo; because the definitions of &ldquo;vessel of the United States&rdquo; and &ldquo;barge&rdquo; are being moved to chapter 1 of the revised title and being made applicable title-wide.</p>
