<p class="note-body">In this section, the words &ldquo;certificate of documentation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;register&rdquo; and &ldquo;papers&rdquo; for consistency with chapter 121 of title 46. The words &ldquo;sea-letter, and Mediterranean passport&rdquo; in R.S. &sect;4309 are omitted because the use of those documents was discontinued by Presidential proclamation on April 10, 1815. The words &ldquo;consular officer&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;consul or vice consul&rdquo; for consistency with 22 U.S.C. 4205. The words &ldquo;commercial agent, or vice commercial agent&rdquo; in R.S. &sect;&sect;4309 and 4310 are omitted because of the abolition of the grade of commercial agent by the Act of Apr. 5, 1906 (ch. 1366, 34 Stat. 99).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;or commander&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary and for consistency in the section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the word &ldquo;failing&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;refuses or neglects&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;liable to a penalty&rdquo; for clarity and for consistency in the revised title.</p>
