<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;A seaman injured in the course of employment or, if the seaman dies from the injury, the personal representative of the seaman&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment&rdquo; and &ldquo;in case of the death of any seaman as a result of any such personal injury the personal representative&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;bring a civil action&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;maintain an action&rdquo; for consistency with rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.). The words &ldquo;for damages&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;against the employer&rdquo; are <!-- PDFPage:210 -->added for clarity. The words &ldquo;Laws of the United States regulating recovery for personal injury to, or death of, a railway employee&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common-law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees&rdquo; and &ldquo;all statutes of the United States conferring or regulating the right of action for death in the case of railway employees&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;An action under this section shall be brought&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Jurisdiction in such actions shall be under&rdquo; because 46 App. U.S.C. 688(a) (last sentence) provides for venue, not jurisdiction. <em>Panama R.R. Co. v. Johnson</em>, 264 U.S. 375 (1924). As to the relationship between 46 App. U.S.C. 688(a) (last sentence) and 28 U.S.C. 1391(c), see <em>Pure Oil Co. v. Suarez</em>, 384 U.S. 202 (1966).</p>
