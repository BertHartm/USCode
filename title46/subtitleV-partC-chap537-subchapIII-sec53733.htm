<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2)(A)(i), the words &ldquo;(as defined in title 1)&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because chapter 1 of the revised title contains a title-wide definition of &ldquo;vessel&rdquo; that incorporates the definition in title 1, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;and subject to the terms the Secretary shall be prescribe&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because section 53702(a) of the revised title provides the Secretary authority to prescribe the terms. The words &ldquo;Only a private shipyard is eligible to receive a guarantee&rdquo; are substituted for 46 App. U.S.C. 1280a to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
