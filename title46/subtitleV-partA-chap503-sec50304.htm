<p class="note-body">In subsections (b) and (c), the words &ldquo;property described in the second paragraph of section 17 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 (ch. 250, 41 Stat. 994), as originally enacted&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;such other docks, piers, warehouses, wharves and terminal equipment and facilities or parts thereof, including all leasehold easements, rights of way, riparian rights and other rights, estates or interests therein or appurtenant thereto which were acquired .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for military or naval purposes during the war emergency&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;property described in section 17 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 (ch. 250, 41 Stat. 994), as originally enacted&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;property taken over by or transferred to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. under this section&rdquo;, because the first paragraph of section 17 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, was repealed in 1981 and reference to that paragraph is necessary for a complete understanding of these provisions. The words &ldquo;Secretary of a military department&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;War Department or the Navy Department&rdquo; and &ldquo;Department of the Army, <!-- PDFPage:258 -->Department of the Air Force, or Department of the Navy&rdquo; for consistency with other titles of the United States Code. For redesignation of the Department of War to the Department of the Army, and for transfer of certain functions to newly established Department of the Air Force, see sections 205(a) and 207(a) and (f) of the National Security Act of 1947 (ch. 343, 61 Stat. 501, 502, 503).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;possessed and controlled by&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;acquired by&rdquo; for clarity and for consistency in the section. The word &ldquo;best&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary.</p>
