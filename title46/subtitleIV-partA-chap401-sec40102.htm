<p class="note-body">In the definition of &ldquo;service contract&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;The contract may also specify provisions in the event of nonperformance on the part of any party&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary and inappropriate for a definition.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the definition of &ldquo;shipper&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;non-vessel-operating common carrier&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;ocean transportation intermediary, as defined in paragraph (17)(B) of this section&rdquo; because paragraph (17)(B) contains a definition of &ldquo;non-vessel-operating common carrier&rdquo; which is restated as a separate definition.</p>
<p class="note-body">The definition of &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; is omitted because the full name of the Federal Maritime Commission is used the first time the Commission is referred to in each section. The definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary because of 1 U.S.C. 1. The definition of &ldquo;United States&rdquo; is omitted because the term is defined in chapter 1 of the revised title for purposes of the title.</p>
