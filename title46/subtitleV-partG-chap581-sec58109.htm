<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the word &ldquo;individual&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;natural person&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;convicted of violating section 58101(d), 58103, or 58105 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;found guilty of any act or acts declared in this chapter to constitute a misdemeanor&rdquo; because the sections referred to restate the provisions which declare certain acts to be misdemeanors and because the restatement of those provisions does not use the word &ldquo;misdemeanor&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;in any district court of the United States&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;shall be fined under title 18, imprisoned for at least one year but not more than five years, or both&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000, or by imprisonment for not less than one year or more than five years, or by both fine and imprisonment&rdquo; because of chapter 227 of title 18. See 18 U.S.C. 3559 (which classifies offenses based on the maximum term of imprisonment) and 3571 (which establishes fines based on those classifications).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the word &ldquo;organization&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;corporation&rdquo; to reflect the probable intent that the penalty should apply to other organizations in addition to corporations. The words &ldquo;convicted of committing an act prohibited by this subtitle&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;found guilty of any act or acts declared in this chapter to be unlawful&rdquo; for clarity and consistency. The words &ldquo;shall be fined under title 18&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall be punished by a fine of not more than $25,000&rdquo; for consistency with subsection (a).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;An individual or organization convicted of violating a section referred to in subsection (a)&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;any person or corporation convicted of a misdemeanor under the provisions of this chapter&rdquo; for consistency in the section. Reference to the Federal Maritime Commission is omitted because the Commission does not administer any of the provisions referred to.</p>
