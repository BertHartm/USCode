<p class="note-body">Source: International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 14304(a) requires the Secretary to remeasure a vessel, to the extent necessary, if there is an alleged error regarding its measurement or if the vessel or its use undergoes a change substantially affecting its tonnage. The phrase &ldquo;to the extent necessary&rdquo; was included to indicate that a complete remeasurement of the vessel may not be necessary if, for example, an error was made in one portion of the vessel's measurement and only that portion needs to be remeasured.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 14304(b) provides that except as provided in section 14504, a vessel that has been measured does not have to be remeasured to obtain another document or endorsement under chapter 121 of this title.</p>
