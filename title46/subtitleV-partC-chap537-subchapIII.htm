<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>OTEC Demonstration Fund</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There is a special subaccount, known as the OTEC Demonstration Fund, in the account established under section 53717(b)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Use and operation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The OTEC Demonstration Fund shall be used for obligation guarantees authorized under this section that do not qualify under subchapter I of this chapter.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Issuance and Payment of Obligations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Section 53723 of this title applies to the OTEC Demonstration Fund.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;upon such terms as he shall prescribe&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because section 53702(a) of the revised title provides the Secretary authority to prescribe the terms. The text of 46 App. U.S.C. 1279c(a)(1) is omitted as obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f)(1), the words &ldquo;account established under section 53717(b)(1) of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Federal Ship Financing Fund&rdquo; because the accounts under section 53717 replace the Federal Ship Financing Fund.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Applicable Terms</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel in accordance with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the terms applicable under this chapter for vessels documented under the laws of the United States; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Interagency Council</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Establishment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There is an interagency council to carry out this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Composition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The council is composed of the following individuals or their designees:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The Secretary of Transportation, who is the chairman of the council.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The Secretary of State.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:333 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The United States Trade Representative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) The President and Chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Functions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The council shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) obtain information on shipbuilding loan guarantees, direct and indirect subsidies, and other favorable treatment of shipyards provided by foreign governments to shipyards in competition with United States shipyards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) consult regularly with United States shipbuilders to obtain the essential information about international shipbuilding competition on which to set terms for loan guarantees under subsection (a)(2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provide guidance to the Secretary in establishing terms for loan guarantees under subsection (a)(2).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Annual report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than January 31 of each year, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on activities of the Secretary under this section during the preceding year. The report shall include&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a summary of recommendations made to the Secretary during the preceding year about applications submitted to the Secretary during that year for loan guarantees to construct eligible export vessels.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Required Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Benefit to shipbuilding industry</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel unless the Secretary finds that the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of the vessel will aid in the transition of United States shipyards to commercial activities or will preserve shipbuilding assets that would be essential in time of war or national emergency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Priority of documented vessels</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not make a commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel unless the Secretary determines that making the commitment will not result in denial of an economically sound application for a commitment to guarantee an obligation for a vessel documented under the laws of the United States and operating in the domestic or foreign commerce of the United States. The Secretary has sole discretion in making the determination. In making the determination, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the status and economic soundness of pending applications for commitments to guarantee obligations for vessels documented under the laws of the United States that are operating or will be operating in the domestic or foreign commerce of the United States; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Restriction on Transfer of Vessel</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel unless the owner of the vessel agrees with the Secretary that the vessel will not be transferred to a country designated by the Secretary of Defense as a country whose interests are hostile to the interests of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Disapproval</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense, within 30 days after receiving the notice, may disapprove the guarantee based on an assessment of the potential use of the vessel in a manner that may harm the national security interests of the United States. The Secretary may not disapprove a guarantee solely because of the type of vessel to be constructed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Delegation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority of the Secretary of Defense to disapprove a guarantee under this subsection may be delegated only to a civilian officer of the Department of Defense appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not make a loan guarantee disapproved by the Secretary of Defense under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Expiration of Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not issue a commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel under this chapter after the last date on which such a commitment may be issued under any treaty or convention entered into after November 30, 1993, that prohibits guarantee of such an obligation.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary, on terms the Secretary may prescribe, may guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee the payment of the principal of and interest on an obligation that aids in financing or refinancing (including reimbursement of an obligor for expenditures previously made for) a contract for the construction or reconstruction of a vessel if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the vessel is designed and to be used for commercial use in coastwise, intercoastal, or foreign trade;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the construction or reconstruction is necessary to replace a vessel that cannot continue to be operated because of a change required by law in the standards for the operation of vessels, and the applicant for the guarantee or commitment would not otherwise legally be able to continue operating vessels in the trades in which the applicant operated vessels before the change;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the applicant is presently engaged in transporting cargoes in vessels of the type and class that will be constructed or reconstructed under this section and agrees to employ vessels constructed or reconstructed under this section as replacements only for vessels made obsolete by the change in operating standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the capacity of the vessels to be constructed or reconstructed under this section will not increase the cargo carrying capacity of the vessels being replaced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the Secretary has not determined that the market demand for the vessel over its useful life will diminish so as to make granting the guarantee fiduciarily imprudent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the vessel, if to be reconstructed, will have a useful life of at least 15 years after the reconstruction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the Secretary has considered the criteria specified in section 53708(a)(3)&ndash;(5) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Term and Amount of Obligation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Term</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term of an obligation guaranteed under this section may not exceed 25 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Amount</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The amount of an obligation guaranteed under this section may not exceed 87.5 percent of the actual cost or depreciated actual cost to the applicant for the construction or reconstruction of the vessel. The Secretary may not establish a percentage under this paragraph that is to be applied uniformly to all guarantees or commitments to guarantee made under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Applicability of Other Provisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A guarantee or commitment to guarantee under this section is also subject to sections 53701, 53702(a), 53704, 53705, 53707(a), 53708(d) and (e), 53709(a), 53710(a)(1), (2), and (4) and (c), 53711(a), 53713, 53714, 53717, and 53721&ndash;53725 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Security Against Default</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall require by regulation that an applicant under this section provide adequate security against default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Guarantee Fees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may establish a fee for the guarantee of an obligation under this section that is in addition to the fee established under section 53714 of this title. The fee may be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an annual fee of not more than an additional 1 percent added to the fee established under section 53714 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a fee based on the amount of the obligation versus the percentage of the obligor's fleet being replaced by vessels constructed or reconstructed under this section.</p>
