<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;bring a civil action .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in a district court of the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;petition a district court of the United States&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. See rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.). The words &ldquo;of competent jurisdiction&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the word &ldquo;pending&rdquo; before &ldquo;freight&rdquo; is added for consistency in the chapter. The words &ldquo;to carry out this chapter&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;to carry out the provisions of section 183 of this Appendix&rdquo; because of the reorganization of the source provisions.</p>
