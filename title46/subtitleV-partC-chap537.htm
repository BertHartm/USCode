In subparagraph (B), the reference to section 53717 is substituted for the reference to 46 App. U.S.C. 1272 because the accounts under section 53717 replace the Federal Ship Financing Fund. See the explanation for section 53717.</p>

The Committee therefore states that this codification should not be construed as an expression of any opinion whatsoever concerning any such administrative interpretation.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the reference to section 503 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, is substituted for the reference to &ldquo;subchapter V of this chapter&rdquo; because the relevant characteristics referred to in the text are contained in that section and because that section is part of the construction-differential subsidy program, which is not being restated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for a vessel to be constructed, reconstructed, or reconditioned or equipment to be delivered, at least 0.25 percent and not more than 0.5 percent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>When Fee Collected</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A fee for the guarantee of an obligation under this chapter shall be collected not later than the date on which an amount is first paid on the obligation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Financing the Fee</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A fee paid under this section is eligible to be financed under this chapter and shall be included in the actual cost of the obligation guaranteed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Not Refundable</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A fee paid under this section is not refundable.

If the aggregate actual cost of the vessel has increased since the Secretary's initial approval or if it increases after the first disbursement is permitted under this subsection, then no further disbursements shall be made under subsection (c) until the total amount paid by or for the account of the obligor from sources other than the proceeds of the obligation equals at least 25 percent or 12.5 percent, as applicable, of the increase, as determined by the Secretary, in the aggregate actual cost of the vessel. This paragraph does not require the Secretary to consent to finance any increase in actual cost unless the Secretary determines that such an increase in the obligation meets all the terms and conditions of this chapter or other applicable law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Documented proof of progress requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall, by regulation, establish a transparent, independent, and risk-based process for verifying and documenting the progress of projects under construction before disbursing guaranteed loan funds. At a minimum, the process shall require documented proof of progress in connection with the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of a vessel or vessels before disbursements are made from the escrow fund. The Secretary may require that the obligor provide a certificate from an independent party certifying that the requisite progress in construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning has taken place.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a payment has not become due under the guarantee before the ter<!-- PDFPage:326 -->mination of the escrow agreement, the balance of the escrow fund at the time of termination shall be disbursed to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Benefit to shipbuilding industry</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel unless the Secretary finds that the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of the vessel will aid in the transition of United States shipyards to commercial activities or will preserve shipbuilding assets that would be essential in time of war or national emergency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Priority of documented vessels</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not make a commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel unless the Secretary determines that making the commitment will not result in denial of an economically sound application for a commitment to guarantee an obligation for a vessel documented under the laws of the United States and operating in the domestic or foreign commerce of the United States. The Secretary has sole discretion in making the determination. In making the determination, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the status and economic soundness of pending applications for commitments to guarantee obligations for vessels documented under the laws of the United States that are operating or will be operating in the domestic or foreign commerce of the United States; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Restriction on Transfer of Vessel</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not guarantee or make a com<!-- PDFPage:333 -->mitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel unless the owner of the vessel agrees with the Secretary that the vessel will not be transferred to a country designated by the Secretary of Defense as a country whose interests are hostile to the interests of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Disapproval</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense, within 30 days after receiving the notice, may disapprove the guarantee based on an assessment of the potential use of the vessel in a manner that may harm the national security interests of the United States. The Secretary may not disapprove a guarantee solely because of the type of vessel to be constructed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Delegation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority of the Secretary of Defense to disapprove a guarantee under this subsection may be delegated only to a civilian officer of the Department of Defense appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not make a loan guarantee disapproved by the Secretary of Defense under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Expiration of Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not issue a commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel under this chapter after the last date on which such a commitment may be issued under any treaty or convention entered into after November 30, 1993, that prohibits guarantee of such an obligation.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;53734. Replacement of vessels because of changes in operating standards</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary, on terms the Secretary may prescribe, may guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee the payment of the principal of and interest on an obligation that aids in financing or refinancing (including reimbursement of an obligor for expenditures previously made for) a contract for the construction or reconstruction of a vessel if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the vessel is designed and to be used for commercial use in coastwise, intercoastal, or foreign trade;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the construction or reconstruction is necessary to replace a vessel that cannot continue to be operated because of a change required by law in the standards for the operation of vessels, and the applicant for the guarantee or commitment would not otherwise legally be able to continue operating vessels in the trades in which the applicant operated vessels before the change;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the applicant is presently engaged in transporting cargoes in vessels of the type and <!-- PDFPage:335 -->class that will be constructed or reconstructed under this section and agrees to employ vessels constructed or reconstructed under this section as replacements only for vessels made obsolete by the change in operating standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the capacity of the vessels to be constructed or reconstructed under this section will not increase the cargo carrying capacity of the vessels being replaced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the Secretary has not determined that the market demand for the vessel over its useful life will diminish so as to make granting the guarantee fiduciarily imprudent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the vessel, if to be reconstructed, will have a useful life of at least 15 years after the reconstruction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the Secretary has considered the criteria specified in section 53708(a)(3)&ndash;(5) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Term and Amount of Obligation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Term</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term of an obligation guaranteed under this section may not exceed 25 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Amount</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The amount of an obligation guaranteed under this section may not exceed 87.5 percent of the actual cost or depreciated actual cost to the applicant for the construction or reconstruction of the vessel. The Secretary may not establish a percentage under this paragraph that is to be applied uniformly to all guarantees or commitments to guarantee made under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Applicability of Other Provisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A guarantee or commitment to guarantee under this section is also subject to sections 53701, 53702(a), 53704, 53705, 53707(a), 53708(d) and (e), 53709(a), 53710(a)(1), (2), and (4) and (c), 53711(a), 53713, 53714, 53717, and 53721&ndash;53725 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Security Against Default</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall require by regulation that an applicant under this section provide adequate security against default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Guarantee Fees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may establish a fee for the guarantee of an obligation under this section that is in addition to the fee established under section 53714 of this title. The fee may be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an annual fee of not more than an additional 1 percent added to the fee established under section 53714 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a fee based on the amount of the obligation versus the percentage of the obligor's fleet being replaced by vessels constructed or reconstructed under this section.</p>
