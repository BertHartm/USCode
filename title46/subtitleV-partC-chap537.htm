<p class="note-body">In paragraph (2), the words &ldquo;but shall not be limited to&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In paragraph (4)(B), the words &ldquo;become or remain&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;be placed under or continued to be&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In paragraph (5)(B)(i), the words &ldquo;individual who is a citizen of the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;individual who is a citizen or national of the United States or a citizen of the Northern Mariana Islands&rdquo; in 46 App. U.S.C. 1271(k) because of the definition of &ldquo;citizen of the United States&rdquo; in chapter 1 of the revised title. Citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands became citizens or non-citizen nationals of the United States (either of which is a &ldquo;citizen of the United States&rdquo; as defined in chapter 1 of the revised title) when the Covenant establishing the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands became effective on November 4, 1986.</p>
<p class="note-body">In paragraph (5)(B)(ii), the words &ldquo;corporation, partnership, association, or other&rdquo; are omitted as suplus [sic]. The words &ldquo;the term &lsquo;State&rsquo; as used therein includes any State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands of the United States, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, or any other Commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States&rdquo; in 46 App. U.S.C. 1271(k) are omitted as unnecessary because of the definitions of &ldquo;State&rdquo; and &ldquo;United States&rdquo; in chapter 1 of the revised title. The definition of &ldquo;United States&rdquo; in 46 App. U.S.C. 1271(m) is omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of &ldquo;United States&rdquo; in chapter 1. The words &ldquo;and nationals of the United States or citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands shall be treated as citizens of the United States in meeting such ownership requirement&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of &ldquo;citizen of the United States&rdquo; in chapter 1 of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In paragraph (8), before subparagraph (A), the words &ldquo;instrument of indebtedness&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;note, bond, debenture, or other evidence of indebtedness&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. In subparagraph (B), the reference to section 53717 is substituted for the reference to 46 App. U.S.C. 1272 because the accounts under section 53717 replace the Federal Ship Financing Fund.

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The maritime loan guarantee program was established by the Congress through the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 [see Short Title of 1936 Amendment <!-- PDFPage:337 -->note set out under section 101 of this title] to encourage domestic shipbuilding by making available federally backed loan guarantees for new construction to ship owners and operators.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The maritime loan guarantee program has a long and successful history of ship construction with a low historical default rate.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The current process for review of applications for maritime loans in the Department of Transportation has effectively discontinued the program as envisioned by the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The President has requested no funding for the loan guarantee program despite the stated national policy to foster the development and encourage the maintenance of a merchant marine in section 50101 of title 46, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) United States commercial shipyards were placed at a competitive disadvantage in the world shipbuilding market by government subsidized foreign commercial shipyards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The maritime loan guarantee program has the potential to modernize shipyards and the ships of the United States coastwise trade and restore a competitive position in the world shipbuilding market for United States shipyards.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any interest the Secretary or Administrator may require on the amount described in paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Security Involving Both Uncompleted and Delivered Vessels</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the security for the <!-- PDFPage:349 -->guarantee of an obligation relates both to a vessel to be constructed, reconstructed, or reconditioned and to a delivered vessel, the principal amount of the obligation shall be prorated for purposes of subsection (a) under regulations prescribed by the Secretary or Administrator.</p>

If the aggregate actual cost of the vessel has increased since the Secretary's or Administrator's initial approval or if it increases after the first disbursement is permitted under this subsection, then no further disbursements shall be made under subsection (c) until the total amount paid by or for the account of the obligor from sources other than the proceeds of the obligation equals at least 25 percent or 12.5 percent, as applicable, of the increase, as determined by the Secretary or Administrator, in the aggregate actual cost of the vessel. This paragraph does not require the Secretary or Administrator to consent to finance any increase in actual cost unless the Secretary or Administrator determines that such an increase in the obligation meets all the terms and conditions of this chapter or other applicable law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Documented proof of progress requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary or Administrator shall, by regulation, establish a transparent, independent, and risk-based process for verifying and documenting the progress of projects under construction before disbursing guaranteed loan funds. At a minimum, the process shall require documented proof of progress in connection with the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of a vessel or vessels before disbursements are made from the escrow fund. The Secretary or Administrator may require that the obligor provide a certificate from an independent party certifying that the requisite progress in construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning has taken place.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Applicable Terms</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel in accordance with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the terms applicable under this chapter for vessels documented under the laws of the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) other terms the Administrator determines are more favorable than those terms and compatible with export credit terms offered by foreign governments for the sale of vessels built in foreign shipyards.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Interagency Council</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Establishment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There is an interagency council to carry out this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Composition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The council is composed of the following individuals or their designees:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The Administrator, who is the chairman of the council.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The Secretary of State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The United States Trade Representative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) The President and Chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Functions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The council shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) obtain information on shipbuilding loan guarantees, direct and indirect subsidies, and other favorable treatment of shipyards provided by foreign governments to shipyards in competition with United States shipyards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) consult regularly with United States shipbuilders to obtain the essential information about international shipbuilding competition on which to set terms for loan guarantees under subsection (a)(2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provide guidance to the Administrator in establishing terms for loan guarantees under subsection (a)(2).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Annual report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than January 31 of each year, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report on activities of the Administrator under this section during the preceding year. The report shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) documentation of sources of information about assistance by governments of other countries to shipyards in those countries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a summary of recommendations made to the Administrator during the preceding year about applications submitted to the Administrator during that year for loan guarantees to construct eligible export vessels.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Required Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Benefit to shipbuilding industry</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may not guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel unless the Administrator finds that the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of the vessel will aid in the transition of United States shipyards to commercial activities or will preserve shipbuilding assets that would be essential in time of war or national emergency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Priority of documented vessels</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may not make a commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel unless the Administrator determines that making the commitment will not result in denial of an economically sound application for a commitment to guarantee an obligation for a vessel documented under the laws of the United States and operating in the domestic or foreign commerce of the United States. The Administrator has sole discretion in making the determination. In making the determination, the Administrator shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the status and economic soundness of pending applications for commitments to guarantee obligations for vessels documented under the laws of the United States that are operating or will be operating in the domestic or foreign commerce of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of guarantee authority available.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Restriction on Transfer of Vessel</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may not guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel unless the owner of the vessel agrees with the Administrator that the vessel will not be transferred to a country designated by the Secretary of Defense as a country whose interests are hostile to the interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Review by Secretary of Defense</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Notification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall promptly notify the Secretary of Defense of the receipt of an application for a loan guarantee for an eligible export vessel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Disapproval</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense, within 30 days after receiving the notice, may disapprove the guarantee based on an assessment of the potential use of the vessel in a manner that may harm the national security interests of the United States. The Secretary of Defense may not disapprove a guarantee solely because of the type of vessel to be constructed.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:357 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Delegation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority of the Secretary of Defense to disapprove a guarantee under this subsection may be delegated only to a civilian officer of the Department of Defense appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may not make a loan guarantee disapproved by the Secretary of Defense under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Expiration of Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may not issue a commitment to guarantee an obligation for an eligible export vessel under this chapter after the last date on which such a commitment may be issued under any treaty or convention entered into after November 30, 1993, that prohibits guarantee of such an obligation.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (f), the source provides that the authority to issue commitments to guarantee obligations for eligible export vessels expires after the later of three events. The first event, which is &ldquo;(A) the 5th anniversary of the date on which the Secretary publishes final regulations setting forth the application procedures for the issuance of commitments to guarantee obligations for eligible export vessels&rdquo;, is omitted because the final regulations were published on September 16, 1994. See 59 Fed. Reg. 47548. The second event, which is &ldquo;(B) the last day of any 5-year period in which funding and guarantee authority for obligations for eligible export vessels have been continuously available&rdquo;, is omitted because that date was November 11, 1998, five years after enactment of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1994 (Pub.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;53734. Replacement of vessels because of changes in operating standards</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary or Administrator, on terms the Secretary or Administrator may prescribe, may guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee the payment of the principal of and interest on an obligation that aids in financing or refinancing (including reimbursement of an obligor for expenditures previously made for) a contract for the construction or reconstruction of a vessel if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the vessel is designed and to be used for commercial use in coastwise, intercoastal, or foreign trade;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the construction or reconstruction is necessary to replace a vessel that cannot continue to be operated because of a change required by law in the standards for the operation of vessels, and the applicant for the guarantee or commitment would not otherwise legally be able to continue operating vessels in the trades in which the applicant operated vessels before the change;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the applicant is presently engaged in transporting cargoes in vessels of the type and class that will be constructed or reconstructed under this section and agrees to employ vessels constructed or reconstructed under this section as replacements only for vessels made obsolete by the change in operating standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the capacity of the vessels to be constructed or reconstructed under this section will not increase the cargo carrying capacity of the vessels being replaced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the Secretary or Administrator has not determined that the market demand for the vessel over its useful life will diminish so as to make granting the guarantee fiduciarily imprudent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the vessel, if to be reconstructed, will have a useful life of at least 15 years after the reconstruction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the Secretary or Administrator has considered the criteria specified in section 53708(a)(3)&ndash;(5) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Term and Amount of Obligation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Term</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term of an obligation guaranteed under this section may not exceed 25 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Amount</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The amount of an obligation guaranteed under this section may not exceed 87.5 percent of the actual cost or depreciated actual cost to the applicant for the construction or reconstruction of the vessel. The Secretary or Administrator may not establish a percentage under this paragraph that is to be applied uniformly to all guarantees or commitments to guarantee made under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Applicability of Other Provisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A guarantee or commitment to guarantee under this section is also subject to sections 53701, 53702(a), 53704, 53705, 53707(a), 53708(d) and (e), 53709(a), 53710(a)(1), (2), and (4) and (c), 53711(a), 53713, 53714, 53717, and 53721&ndash;53725 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Security Against Default</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary or Administrator shall require by regulation that an applicant under this section provide adequate security against default.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Guarantee Fees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary or Administrator may establish a fee for the guarantee of an obligation under this section that is in addition to the fee established under section 53714 of this title. The fee may be&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:359 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an annual fee of not more than an additional 1 percent added to the fee established under section 53714 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a fee based on the amount of the obligation versus the percentage of the obligor's fleet being replaced by vessels constructed or reconstructed under this section.</p>
