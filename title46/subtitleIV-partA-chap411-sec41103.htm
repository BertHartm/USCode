<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;marine terminal operator, or ocean freight forwarder&rdquo; are added because of 46 App. U.S.C. 1709(d)(3) and (5). The words &ldquo;ocean freight forwarder&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;ocean transportation intermediaries, as defined by section 1702(17)(A) of this Appendix&rdquo; in 46 App. U.S.C. 1709(d)(5) because the definition of &ldquo;ocean transportation intermediary&rdquo; in section 1702(17)(A) contains a definition of &ldquo;ocean freight forwarder&rdquo; which is restated as a separate definition.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;does not prevent&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Nothing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall be construed to prevent&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1), the words &ldquo;may give information&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Nor shall it be prohibited .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to give information&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;firm, corporation&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because firms and corporations are persons.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(2), the words &ldquo;may not prevent&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Nor shall it be prohibited .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to prevent&rdquo; to reflect the probable intent of Congress. The words &ldquo;but the use of such information for any other purpose prohibited by this chapter or any other Act is prohibited&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
