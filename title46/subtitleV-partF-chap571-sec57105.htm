<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may acquire a vessel, by purchase or otherwise, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary considers the vessel necessary to establish, maintain, improve, or serve as a replacement on an essential service, route, or line in the foreign commerce of the United States, as determined under section 50103 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the vessel was constructed in the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Secretary of the Navy has certified to the Secretary of Transportation that the vessel is suitable for economical and speedy conversion into a naval or military auxiliary or otherwise suitable for use by the United States Government in time of war or national emergency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Price</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The price paid for the vessel shall be based on a fair and reasonable valuation. However, the price may not exceed by more than 5 percent the cost of the vessel to the owner (excluding any construction-differential subsidy and the cost of national defense features paid by the Secretary of Transportation) plus the actual cost previously expended for reconditioning, less depreciation based on a 25-year life for a dry-cargo or passenger vessel and a 20-year life for a tanker or other liquid bulk carrier vessel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Documentation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A vessel acquired under this section that is not documented under the laws of the United States at the time of acquisition shall be so documented as soon as practicable.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;and to pay for the same out of his construction fund&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete because the construction fund established under 46 App. U.S.C. 1116 was impliedly abolished by 46 App. U.S.C. 1119, as amended.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;less depreciation based on a 25-year life for a dry-cargo or passenger vessel and a 20-year life for a tanker or other liquid bulk carrier vessel&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;less depreciation based upon a twenty-five year life expectancy of the vessel&rdquo; because of section 9 of Public Law 86&ndash;518 (June 12, 1960, 74 Stat. 217), which provided that &ldquo;Nothing in any amendment made by this Act [including section 1 substituting &lsquo;twenty-five&rsquo; for &lsquo;twenty&rsquo; in 46 App. U.S.C. 1125] shall operate or be interpreted to change from twenty to twenty-five years the provisions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended, relating to the commercial expectancy or period of depreciation of any tanker or other liquid bulk carrier.&rdquo;</p>
