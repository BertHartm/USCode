<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before paragraph (1), the words &ldquo;To be eligible for a guarantee under this chapter, an obligation must aid in any of the following&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Pursuant to the authority granted under section 1273(a) of this Appendix, the Secretary, upon such terms as he shall prescribe, may guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee, payment of the principal of and interest on an obligation which aids in&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2), the words &ldquo;citizens of the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;citizens or nationals of the United States or citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands&rdquo; because of the definition of &ldquo;citizen of the United States&rdquo; in chapter 1 of the revised title. Citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands became citizens or non-citizen nationals of the United States (either of which is a &ldquo;citizen of the United States&rdquo; as defined in chapter 1 of the revised title) when the Covenant establishing the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands became effective November 4, 1986.</p>
