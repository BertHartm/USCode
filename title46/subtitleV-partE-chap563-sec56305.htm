<p class="note-body">In this section, the words &ldquo;encumbrance&rdquo; and &ldquo;encumbrances&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;any valid claim by way of mortgage or maritime claim or attachment lien&rdquo; and &ldquo;any valid claim by way of mortgage or maritime lien or attachment lien&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;The Secretary shall publish notice of the creation of the fund in the Federal Register&rdquo; are added for clarity, based on language barring a civil action not brought within 6 months after publication of such a notice.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1), the words &ldquo;Within 6 months after publication of notice under subsection (b)&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;prior to June 30, 1943, or within six months after the first such deposit with the Treasurer and publication of notice thereof in the Federal Register, whichever date is later&rdquo; for clarity and to eliminate obsolete language.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c)(3) is substituted for &ldquo;and such suit shall be commenced in the manner provided by section 742 of this Appendix and service of process shall be made in the manner therein provided by service upon the United States attorney and by mailing by registered mail to the Attorney General and the Secretary of Transportation and due notice shall under order of the court be given to all interested persons&rdquo; because the relevant sentences in 46 App. U.S.C. 742 were struck by an amendment in 1996. See generally <em>Henderson v. United States</em>, 517 U.S. 654, 116 S. Ct. 1638 (1996).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(4), the words &ldquo;any decree in said suit shall be paid out of the first and all subsequent deposits of compensation&rdquo; and &ldquo;any decree shall be subject to appeal and revision as now provided in other cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
