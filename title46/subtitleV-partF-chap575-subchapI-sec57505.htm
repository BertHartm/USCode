<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;As soon as practicable after June 29, 1936, and continuing thereafter&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete. The words &ldquo;However, the Secretary shall first determine that those routes are not being adequately served&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;<em>Provided</em>, That such needs are not being adequately served&rdquo; for clarity and because provisos are disfavored in modern drafting.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;in the manner provided in section 7 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 [46 App. U.S.C. 866], and in strict accordance with the provisions of section 5 of said Act&rdquo; are omitted because section 5 of that Act was repealed in 1988, and section 7 is being repealed as obsolete by this bill without being restated.</p>
