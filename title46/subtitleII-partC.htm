<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) &ldquo;existing vessel&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body">Source: Section (U.S. Code) 46 App. U.S.C. 86a.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 5101 contains definitions that are limited to Chapter 51&mdash;Load Lines. Existing Section 46 App. U.S.C. 86a (which defines only the terms &ldquo;new ship&rdquo; and &ldquo;existing ship&rdquo;) will be replaced by section 5101. Definitions of technical terms (&ldquo;freeboard&rdquo;, &ldquo;freeboard deck&rdquo;, and &ldquo;minimum safe freeboard&rdquo;) have been added for clarity. The definition of the term &ldquo;new ship&rdquo; has been deleted because the term is not used in Chapter 51. The definition of &ldquo;domestic voyage&rdquo; includes the phrase &ldquo;places in or subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.&rdquo; &ldquo;Places subject to the jurisdiction of the United States&rdquo; include deep water ports, production platforms, mining sites outside of territorial waters of the United States but within the United States&rsquo; Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) that was established by Presidential Proclamation 5030, dated March 10, 1983, or on the outer continental shelf. The phrases &ldquo;economic benefit of overloading&rdquo; and &ldquo;weight of the overload&rdquo; have been defined for purposes of establishing a standard method of determining the value of the cargo with which a vessel is overloaded. The value of the cargo will in turn affect the maximum penalty assessed for overloading the vessel. The definition of &ldquo;freeboard deck&rdquo; provides the Secretary with the authority to designate as the freeboard deck either the actual deck (on standard vessels) or another structure (on non-standard vessels). Non-standard vessels, for which this regulatory flexibility is necessary, include shelter deck vessels, semi-submersible multi-hull units, container ships, surface effect vessels, and commercial submarines.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head"><em>Revised section 5102</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Source: Section (U.S. Code) 46 App. U.S.C. 86b, 86c, 88.</p>
<p class="note-body">The delineation of the vessels that will be subject to load line requirements is made in section 5102 as follows: subsection (a) is an all-inclusive list of vessels subject to load line requirements, followed by subsection (b) which specifically exempts those vessels to which the requirements do not apply.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 5102(a) lists five categories of vessels which are subject to load line requirements. They are as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (1) regarding &ldquo;a vessel of the United States&rdquo; includes all vessels documented under Chapter 121 of title 46 or numbered under Chapter 123 of title 46.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (2) regarding &ldquo;a vessel on the navigable waters of the United States&rdquo; includes all domestic or foreign vessels found in or on the navigable waters of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (3) regarding &ldquo;a vessel owned by a citizen of the United States or a corporation established by or under the laws of the United States or a State, and not registered in a foreign country&rdquo; includes all vessels owned by citizens of the United States (as defined in 5107(7)) [sic] and not registered under the laws of a foreign country, wherever the vessels may be located.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (4) regarding &ldquo;a public vessel of the United States&rdquo; includes all United States public vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (5) regarding &ldquo;a vessel otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the United States&rdquo; includes foreign vessels that are subject to United States jurisdiction as a result of bilateral agreements, licenses, customary international law or other means, including those using deepwater port or outer continental shelf or EEZ facilities located in areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 5102(b) lists the specific exemptions from load line requirements. The specific exemptions may be grouped as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(a) Vessel type (ships of war, pleasure vessels, fishing vessels, small passenger vessels on domestic voyages);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(b) Area of operation (rivers, harbors, bays, sounds, etc.);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(c) Minimum size (length); and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(d) Treaty exclusions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (1) exempts vessels of war from load line requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (2) exempts recreational vessels operated only for pleasure from load line requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (3) exempts fishing vessels from load line requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clauses (4) and (5) exempt certain existing fish processing and fish tender vessels not on a foreign voyage from load line requirements. The exception is limited to those vessels not on international voyages to ensure compliance with United States obligations under the International Load Line Convention.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (6) exempts from load line requirements all U.S. vessels operating on domestic voyages within the Boundary Line, as defined in section 2101 of this title, except vessels operating on the Great Lakes.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (7) exempts all vessels that are less than 24 meters (79 feet) in length from load line requirements whether on international or domestic voyages.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (8) exempts from load line requirements those public vessels that are on domestic voyages.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (9) exempts from load line requirements those vessels which have been excluded from the requirements &ldquo;by specific action of a treaty of the United States.&rdquo; The only current treaty which excludes vessels from load line requirements is the Convention Between the United States of America and the Dominion of Canada Concerning Load Lines (49 Stat. 2685), which entered into force on August 11, 1934.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (10) exempts from load line requirements existing U.S. vessels that are under 150 gross tons while engaged on a domestic voyage. This is a grandfather provision, continuing the existing exemption for these vessels. Vessels built after January 1, 1986 must be marked with a load line, however, if they are over 79 feet long and do not qualify for any other exemption.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (11) exempts small passenger vessels engaged on domestic voyages from load line requirements. Small passenger vessels are inspected under Subchapter T of Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Under Subchapter T, the Coast Guard regulates these vessels with regard to safety; the requirements are based on the number of passengers, length, and gross tonnage of the vessel. Safety-related requirements in Subchapter T regulations include hull structure and watertightness, stability, weathertight integrity, and safe movement of persons on deck, the principal safety features covered by load line regulations. This specific exemption from load line requirements for small passenger vessels is consistent with existing law and does not alter in any way the Coast Guard's authority to regulate small passenger vessels under Subchapter T.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (12) exempts vessels of the working voyages from the requirement to have load lines.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 5102(c) authorizes the Secretary to assign load lines for any vessel exempted from load line requirements by subsection (b) upon the request of the owner. It also provides that any exempted vessel for which load lines are assigned will remain subject to the load line requirements until its load line certificate is surrendered and the load line marks are removed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 5102(d) provides that this chapter shall not be construed as abrogating the provisions of other treaties and conventions to which the United States is a party, which are not in conflict with the International Convention on Load Lines.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 5104(a) requires the Secretary to assign load lines indicating the minimum safe freeboard to which a vessel may be loaded. It also authorizes the Secretary to assign a load line that results in a freeboard that is greater than the minimum freeboard, if the owner requests.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 5104(b) sets forth guidelines that the Secretary must consider when assigning load lines on vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 5104(c) allows an existing vessel to retain its load line assigned before January 1, 1986, unless the Secretary decides that a change made in the vessel requires the assignment of a new load line.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 5104(d) is a new provision that requires that a vessel comply with all the provisions of this chapter before the Secretary will consider a reduction in its minimum freeboard. This provision is similar to Article 4(4) of the International Convention on Load Lines.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 5104(e) is a new provision that authorized the Secretary to designate specific geographic areas having relatively non-severe weather or sea conditions and from which there is adequate time to return to safe harbors. Section 5104(e) also authorizes the Secretary to reduce the minimum freeboard of vessels operating in these areas. Regulations that have been issued under this authority (46 C.F.R. 44) authorize special service load lines for vessels operating not more than 20 nautical miles offshore or between islands in a group.</p>

A specific exemption from load line requirements was authorized in Public Law 98&ndash;557 for barges operating close to shore between Calumet Harbor, Illinois and Burns Harbor, Indiana, because the geographic area and type of operation in this case did not warrant a requirement for load lines. Additional exemptions currently must be made by an Act of Congress. Section 5108(a) authorizes the Secretary to make such exemptions through regulation, and the Committee expects the Secretary to continue the exemption under this provision for vessels operating close to shore between Calumet Harbor, Illinois and Burns Harbor, Indiana.</p>
