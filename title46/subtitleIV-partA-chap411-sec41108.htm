<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Operating Under Suspended Tariff</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A common carrier that accepts or handles cargo for carriage under a tariff that has been suspended, or after its right to use that tariff has been suspended, is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not more than $50,000 for each shipment.</p>
