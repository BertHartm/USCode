<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the text of 46 App. U.S.C. 808a is omitted as unnecessary. In paragraph (1), the words &ldquo;owned by a citizen of the United States&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because ownership by a citizen is a requirement for documentation. See section 12103 as revised by the bill.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), before paragraph (1), the words &ldquo;Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, or any contract with the Secretary made under this subtitle or that Act&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Notwithstanding subsection (c)(2) of this section, the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 [46 App. U.S.C. 1101 et seq.], or any contract entered into with the Secretary of Transportation under that Act&rdquo; because the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, is restated principally in this subtitle, but other provisions of that Act are being neither restated nor repealed.</p>
