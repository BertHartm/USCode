<h3 class="section-head">&sect;60507. Suspension of free passage through Saint Marys Falls Canal</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of this section is to secure reciprocal advantages for the citizens, ports, and vessels of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the President is satisfied that vessels of the United States, or passengers or cargo being transported to a port of the United States, are prohibited from passing through a canal or lock connected with the navigation of the Saint Lawrence River, the Great Lakes, or their connecting waterways, or burdened in that passage by tolls or other means that are unreasonable in view of the free passage through the Saint Marys Falls Canal allowed to vessels of all countries, the President by proclamation may suspend the right of free passage through the Saint Marys Falls Canal for vessels owned by subjects of the country imposing the prohibition, tolls, or other burdens and for passengers and cargo being transported to the ports of that country, even when carried in vessels of the United States. The suspension shall apply to the extent and for the time the President considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Imposition of Toll</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;During a suspension under this section, the President shall impose a toll of not more than $2 per ton on cargo and not more than $5 on each passenger.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Exceptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a toll may not be imposed on passengers or cargo landed at Ogdensburg, New York, or any port west of Ogdensburg and south of a line drawn from the northern boundary of New York through the Saint Lawrence River, the Great Lakes, and their connecting channels to the northern boundary of Minnesota.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Collection of Toll</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A toll imposed under this section shall be collected under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Secretary may require the master of a vessel to provide a sworn statement of the amount and kind of cargo, the number of passengers, and the destination of the passengers and cargo.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Proof of landing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When applicable, the Secretary also may require satisfactory proof that the passengers and cargo were landed at a port described in subsection (c)(2). Until that proof is provided, the Secretary may assume the passengers and cargo were not landed at such a port, and the amount of a toll that otherwise would be imposed is a lien enforceable against the vessel when found in the waters of the United States.</p>
