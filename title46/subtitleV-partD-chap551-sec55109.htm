<p class="note-body">Subsection (a)(1) is substituted for &ldquo;(1) the vessel meets the requirements of section 883 of this Appendix and sections 802 and 803 of this Appendix for engaging in the coastwise trade&rdquo; for consistency with other sections of the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words. Section 883 requires (among other things) that the vessel be owned by citizens of the United States, and section 802 contains the requirements for certain entities to qualify as citizens. Those requirements are restated in section 50501 which applies to this section. <!-- PDFPage:371 -->Section 883 also requires that the vessel be built in and documented under the laws of the United States. Those latter two requirements are covered by subsection (a)(3). Note that the build requirement is a requirement for a coastwise endorsement.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(3), the words &ldquo;or is exempt from documentation but would otherwise be eligible for such a certificate and endorsement&rdquo; are added for consistency with section 12102 as revised by the bill.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">[H.R. Rep. No. 109&ndash;170, at 180 (2005) provided: Section 17(i) of the bill [H.R. 1442, enacted as Pub. L. 109&ndash;304] amends section 5501(a) of the Oceans Act of 1992 (Public Law 102&ndash;587, 106 Stat. 5084) [see note above] by adding a new paragraph (3). The intent of this amendment is to maintain the status quo under paragraph (2) of section 5501(a) of that Act, as it exists prior to the enactment of this codification legislation. Section 55109 of title 46, United States Code, as contained in this bill, is intended as a codification without substantive change of section 1 of the Act of May 28, 1906, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 292). Therefore, the exceptions from that latter provision, which currently exist under such paragraph (2), are intended to continue to exist to the same extent under new section 55109 of title 46. In addition, if the original intent of such paragraph (2) was that the restriction contained in the pre-1992 amended version of that 1906 provision continues to apply to the vessels, persons, and entities described in such paragraph (2), then that outcome is intended to remain unchanged by this legislation, despite the repeal by this legislation of that 1906 provision. No expression as to the original intent of such paragraph (2) is intended by this legislation.]</p>
