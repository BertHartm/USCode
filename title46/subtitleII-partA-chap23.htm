<p class="note-body">Section 2302 states that the negligent operation of a vessel is prohibited. These acts are subject to civil and criminal penalties and the involved vessel is subject to an in rem action. The negligent operation provisions have their genesis in the Act of April 25, 1940, 54 Stat. 167, when Congress prescribed that no person shall operate any motorboat or <em>any vessel</em> in a reckless or negligent manner. This provision was directed at all vessels and not those solely engaged in recreational boating. When the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971, P.L. 92&ndash;75, 85 Stat. 217 (46 U.S.C. 1461) was enacted it adopted the reckless or negligent operation provisions of the 1940 Act. It adopted for the first time a provision for assessing civil penalties in addition to criminal penalties. It dropped the word &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; because of redundancy. It also combined the two classes of vessels; &ldquo;any motorboat or any vessel&rdquo; into one class by using the word &ldquo;vessel&rdquo; and defined vessel as including every description of watercraft.</p>
