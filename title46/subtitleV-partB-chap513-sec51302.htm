<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(6)(A), the words &ldquo;residents, or sons or daughters of residents, of an area or installation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;a resident of the area or installation&rdquo; in 46 App. U.S.C. 1295b(b)(1)(B) and &ldquo;sons or daughters of residents of any area or installation&rdquo; in 46 App. U.S.C. 1295b(b)(3)(A)(ii) to resolve an inconsistency in the source law and to conform to the probable intent of Congress. Although 46 App. U.S.C. 1295b(b)(1)(B) provides that a nominee must be a resident, 46 App. U.S.C. 1295b(b)(3)(A)(ii) allocates positions only for sons or daughters of residents.</p>
