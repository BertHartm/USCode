<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the word &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;Secretary of the Treasury&rdquo;, thereby incorporating the definition of &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; in section 2101 of title 46. The functions of the Secretary of the Treasury relating to the Coast Guard previously were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation by section 6(b) of the Department of Transportation Act (Pub. L. 89&ndash;670, Oct. 15, 1966, 80 Stat. 938). The Coast Guard and the functions of the Secretary of Transportation relating to the Coast Guard were again transferred to the Department of Homeland Security by section 888(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107&ndash;296, Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2135). The words &ldquo;rebuilt outside the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;and any part of the rebuilding, including the construction of major components of the hull and superstructure of the vessel, is not effected within the United States, its Territories (not including trust territories) or its possessions&rdquo; because of the definition of &ldquo;rebuilt&rdquo; in section 12101, and the definition of &ldquo;United States&rdquo; in chapter 1, of the revised title.</p>
