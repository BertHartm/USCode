<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The staff department on a vessel is a separate and independent department. It consists of individuals registered under section 7101 of this title, clerks, and individuals assigned to the senior registered medical doctor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The staff department is composed of a medical division and a purser's division. The officer in charge of each division is responsible only to the master. The senior registered medical doctor is in charge of the medical division. The senior registered purser is in charge of the purser's division.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 8302 sets forth the organization and manning requirements of the staff department of a vessel. The staff department has medical and clerical responsibilities.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) applies this section to every United States vessel except a yacht, a fishing, whaling, or certain types of inland waterway vessel, and a ferry carrying passengers or cars on the Great Lakes. A ferry is a vessel that primarily carries passengers, cars, or trains from shore to shore as a means to connect existing points on a transportation route so that the same type of transportation mode may continue to be used upon arrival at either point. Vessels carrying cars as cargo would not be included in this type of vessel.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) establishes the staff department as a separate one consisting of registered individuals (pursers, medical doctors, and professional nurses), clerks, and medical assistants. Subsection (c) divides the department into a medical division and a purser's division and designates the individual in charge of each division. Subsection (d) prescribes particular requirements of the purser's division based on size of the vessel or number of individuals employed in the division.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (e) prohibits the employment or service of an individual who is not registered or of the grade as required under this section and prescribes a penalty for violation of the subsection. This penalty applies to both the employer and the individual employed. If a registered staff officer is unavailable at the time of departure for a voyage, the vessel may proceed on its voyage with either an unregistered staff officer or without a staff officer.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (f) prohibits including a staff officer on a vessel's certificate of inspection.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsections (g) and (h) prescribe the type and restrictions for the uniform accouterments of a staff officer.</p>
