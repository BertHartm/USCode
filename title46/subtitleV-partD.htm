<p class="note-body">[H.R. Rep. No. 109&ndash;170, at 180 (2005) provided: Section 17(i) of the bill [H.R. 1442, enacted as Pub. L. 109&ndash;304] amends section 5501(a) of the Oceans Act of 1992 (Public Law 102&ndash;587, 106 Stat. 5084) [see note above] by adding a new paragraph (3). The intent of this amendment is to maintain the status quo under paragraph (2) of section 5501(a) of that Act, as it exists prior to the enactment of this codification legislation. Section 55109 of title 46, United States Code, as contained in this bill, is intended as a codification without substantive change of section 1 of the Act of May 28, 1906, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 292). Therefore, the exceptions from that latter provision, which currently exist under such paragraph (2), are intended to continue to exist to the same extent under new section 55109 of title 46. In addition, if the original intent of such paragraph (2) was that the restriction contained in the pre-1992 amended version of that 1906 provision continues to apply to the vessels, persons, and entities described in such paragraph (2), then that outcome is intended to remain unchanged by this legislation, despite the repeal by this legislation of that 1906 provision. No expression as to the original intent of such paragraph (2) is intended by this legislation.]</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A foreign vessel of not more than 50 feet overall in length may unload its catch of fresh fish (whole or with the heads, viscera, or fins removed, but not frozen, otherwise processed, or further advanced) in a port of the Virgin Islands for immediate consumption in those islands. Fish unloaded under this paragraph may be sold or transferred only for immediate consumption. In the absence of satisfactory evidence that a sale or transfer to an agent, representative, or employee of a freezer or cannery is for immediate consumption, the sale or transfer is deemed not to be for immediate consumption. This paragraph does not prohibit the freezing, smoking, or other processing of fresh fish by the ultimate consumer of the fish.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Additional Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Application of section 55305</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The requirement for transportation on vessels of the United States under subsection (a) is subject to the same terms and conditions as provided in section 55305 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Allocation of commodities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to paragraph (3), in carrying out this section and section 55305 of this title, the Corporation shall take steps necessary and practicable, and consistent with this section and section 55305, without detriment to any port range to allocate, on the principle of lowest landed cost without regard to the country of registry of the vessel, 25 percent of the bagged, processed, or fortified commodities provided under title II of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (7 U.S.C. 1721 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Calculations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out paragraph (2), first there shall be calculated the allocation of 100 percent of the quantity to be procured on an overall lowest landed cost basis without regard to the country of registry of the vessel, and then there shall be allocated to the Great Lakes port range any cargoes for which it has the lowest landed cost under that calculation. The requirements for transportation on vessels of the United States under this section and section 55305 of this title do not apply to commodities allocated to the Great Lakes port range under paragraph (2). Commodities allocated to the Great Lakes port range under paragraph (2) may not be reallocated or diverted to another port range to meet those requirements to the extent that the total tonnage of commodities to which paragraph (2) applies that is furnished and transported from the Great Lakes port range is less than 25 percent of the total annual tonnage of the commodities furnished.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may not deny award of the contract to a person based on the type of vessel on which the transportation would be provided (including on the basis that the transportation would not be provided on a liner vessel, as that term is used in the Shipping Act of 1984, as in effect on November 14, 1995), if the person otherwise satisfies reasonable requirements for financial and operational integrity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Nonavailability of vessels</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A determination of nonavailability of vessels of the United States resulting from the application of this subsection may not reduce the gross tonnage of commodities required by this section and section 55305 of this title to be transported on vessels of the United States.</p>
