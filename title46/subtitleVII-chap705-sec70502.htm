<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), before subparagraph (A), the words &ldquo;individual who is a citizen of the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;a citizen or national of the United States&rdquo; because of the definition of &ldquo;citizen of the United States&rdquo; in chapter 1 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;or a territory, commonwealth, or possession of the United States&rdquo; and &ldquo;the District of Columbia, or any territory, commonwealth, or possession of the United States&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of &ldquo;State&rdquo; in chapter 1 of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(3), the words &ldquo;placed under foreign registry, or operated under the authority of a foreign nation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;placed under foreign registry or foreign flag&rdquo; because of the definition of &ldquo;foreign vessel&rdquo; in chapter 1 of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d)(1)(B), the word &ldquo;authorized&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;empowered&rdquo; for consistency with subsection (b)(2)(B).</p>
