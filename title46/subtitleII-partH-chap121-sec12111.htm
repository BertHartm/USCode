<p class="note-body">Under section 12111, a certificate of documentation becomes invalid if the vessel for which it is issued no longer meets the requirements for issuance of the certificate or is placed under the command of a person who is not a citizen of the United States. It also requires the surrender of invalid certificates but gives protection to preferred mortgages.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1988 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amends section 12111 of title 46, United States Code, concerning surrendering and invalidation of certificates of documentation. This section clarifies the requirement that an invalid certificate of documentation must be surrendered to the Secretary. However, until the surrender is approved by the Secretary, the vessel is still a documented vessel for certain purposes such as for commercial instruments that have been recorded, foreign transfer restrictions, and requisitioning in time of war or national emergency. It also requires the Secretary to obtain the mortgagee's approval of the surrender if there is a mortgage on the vessel that has been filed or recorded with the Secretary.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:149 --><h4 class="note-head">house floor statement</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 12111(c)(3) is changed to prohibit the approval of the surrendering of a certificate of documentation for any vessel with a mortgage filed or recorded with the Secretary, not just a vessel with a preferred mortgage.</p>
