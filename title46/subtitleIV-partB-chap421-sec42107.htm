<p class="note-body">In paragraph (1), the words &ldquo;Secretary of Homeland Security&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;collector of customs at the port or place of destination in the United States&rdquo; because the functions of the Customs Service and of the Secretary of the Treasury relating thereto were transferred to the Secretary of Homeland Security by section 403(1) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107&ndash;296, 116 Stat. 2178). The functions of the collector of customs previously were vested in the Secretary of the Treasury by Reorganization Plan No. 26 of 1950, and the office of collector of customs previously was abolished by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1965.</p>
