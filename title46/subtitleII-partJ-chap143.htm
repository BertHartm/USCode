<p class="note-body">Source: International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 14301 delineates which vessels must be measured in compliance with the standards of the Convention.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 14301(a) provides that a vessel must be measured under the standards of the Convention if it is documented or required by law to be documented under chapter 121 of this subtitle or if it is engaged on a foreign voyage, unless the vessel is specifically exempted under section 14301(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 14301(b) provides the following exemptions from the requirement in section 14301(a) to be measured under the Convention:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">1. A vessel of war;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">2. A vessel of less than 24 meters (79 feet) overall in length (&ldquo;overall in length&rdquo; is defined in section 2101);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">3. A vessel that operates only on the Great Lakes (although the owner may request that it be measured under the Convention);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">4. A vessel whose keel was laid or was at a similar stage of construction before January 1, 1986, and is on a domestic voyage, unless the vessel undergoes a change that significantly changes its tonnage or the owner requests that the vessel be measured under the Convention; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">5. A vessel whose keel was laid or was at a similar stage of construction before July 18, 1982, unless the vessel undergoes a change that significantly changes the vessel's tonnage or the owner requests that the vessel be measured under the Convention.</p>
<p class="note-body">Together, subsections (b)(4) and (5) provide that, unless the owner requests measurement under the Convention, unaltered vessels built before 1986 engaging only on domestic voyages do not have to be measured under the Convention or use Convention measurement for the application of any domestic laws. Further, these subsections provide that unaltered vessels that are built before July 18, 1982, engaging on foreign voyages do not have to be measured under the Convention until 1994 and are not required to use Convention measurement as a basis for the application of any domestic laws.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 14301(c) provides that if a vessel owner requests that the vessel be measured under the Convention, the vessel may only be remeasured under the Convention.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 14301(d) provides that after July 18, 1994, a vessel whose keel was laid or was at a similar stage of construction before July 18, 1982 may retain its regulatory tonnage for the application of requirements under U.S. laws or international agreements, except the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships. However, if the vessel was not required to be measured under the Convention, but the vessel's owner requested that the vessel be measured under the Convention system before July 19, 1994, or if the vessel undergoes a change affecting its tonnage, the vessel may not use its regulatory tonnage for the application of U.S. laws or international agreements after July 19, 1994.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 14301(e) provides that this chapter does not affect any international agreement to which the United States is a party that is not in conflict with the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969. It further provides that this chapter does not affect the application of the three interim schemes of the International Maritime Organization, which are discussed under section 14305 below.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class="note-sub-head"><em>Revised section 14305</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Source: International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 14305 requires that the Secretary measure a vessel under chapter 145 (Regulatory Measurement) of this title (in addition to measuring it under the Convention) at the request of the owner. For vessels that have obtained a regulatory tonnage measurement under this section, the Secretary is required to use the regulatory tonnage measurement to determine the application of those laws listed in section 14305(a) and those not listed by the Secretary by regulation, as provided in section 14302(c). It is the intent of the Committee to list in section 14305(a) certain U.S. tonnage-based laws that would impose increased regulatory burdens on industry if the Convention measurement were used for applicability determinations.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (1) of section 14305(a) includes the following parts of subtitle II of title 46, U.S.C.:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Part A: General provisions (including definitions.)</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Part B: Inspection and Regulation of Vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Part C: Load Lines, which is enacted as part of this legislation. Although most load line requirements are based on vessel length, and not tonnage, a few requirements are based on tonnage. (It is only the tonnage based requirements to which this provision applies.)</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Part E: Licenses, Certificates, and Merchant Mariners&rsquo; Documents.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Part F: Manning of Vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Part G: Merchant Seamen Protection and Relief.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:204 --><p class="note-body-1em">Part H: Sections 12106(c) and 12108(c) only&mdash;Identification of Vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body">The other U.S. laws listed in clause (2) through (10) of this section are self-explanatory. Clause (10) refers to domestic law as well as the Officers&rsquo; Competency Certificates Convention, 1936.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition, three other international conventions are listed in clauses (11) through (13): (1) the Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, (2) the Convention on the Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, and (3) the Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. The International Maritime Organization has established interim schemes which address the use of the Convention tonnage measurement system as a basis for the applicability of these three conventions. The applicable sections of those schemes are the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea: IMCO Resolution A.494 (XII) of November 19, 1981 provides &ldquo;that at the request of a shipowner, the Administration may allow a ship required to be measured under the provisions of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969, to use the gross tonnage measured under the national tonnage rules which are in effect prior to the coming into force of the 1969 Tonnage Convention, for the purpose of application of the provisions of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, such tonnage, however, shall not be shown on the 1969 Tonnage Certificate.&rdquo; The resolution further provides that &ldquo;the interim scheme shall not apply to ships the keels of which are laid after 31 December 1985 with the following exceptions:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(a) In respect of the requirements of Regulation 3 of Chapter IV of the 1974 SOLAS Convention for ships the keels of which are laid before 18 July 1994, the Administration may continue to apply the interim scheme, in which case the above-mentioned entry should be made in the Radio-telephony Certificate only; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(b) In respect of the regulations for cargo ships of less than 1,600 tons gross tonnage (as measured under national systems), the keels of which are laid after 31 December 1985, the Administration may continue to apply the interim scheme until 18 July 1984.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978: IMO Resolution A.540 (XIII) of November 17, 1983, provides &ldquo;that the revised interim scheme for tonnage measurement for certain ships adopted by resolution A.494 (XII), [described above] should also be applicable in respect of the provision of the International Convention, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 Relating to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973: IMO Resolution A.541 (XIII) of November 17, 1983, provides that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">At the request of a shipowner, the Administration may allow a ship of less than 400 tons gross tonnage (measured under the previous national tonnage rules) the keel of which is laid on or before 31 December 1985 and which is required to be measured under the provisions of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969, to use the gross tonnage measured under the national tonnage rules which were in effect prior to the coming into force of the 1969 Tonnage Convention, for the purpose of application of the provisions of MARPOL 73/78. Such tonnage, however, shall not be shown on the 1969 Tonnage Certificate.</p>
<p class="note-body">It further provides that &ldquo;the interim scheme shall not apply to ships the keels of which are laid after 31 December 1985, except that in respect of regulations for ships of less than 400 tons gross tonnage (as measured under previous national rules), the keels of which are laid after 31 December 1985, the Administration may continue to apply the interim scheme until 18 July 1994.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (14) provides that the regulatory measurement system may be used to determine which vessels must demonstrate evidence of financial responsibility (when such a demonstration is required by law). If it is determined that a vessel must show evidence of financial responsibility, the limits of financial responsibility are determined using the vessel's Convention measurement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (15) provides that the regulatory measurement system may be used for the application of laws not identified by the Secretary under section 14302(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 14305(b) provides that if a vessel is measured under the regulatory tonnage measurement system for the application of one law listed in subsection (a), it must be measured under that system for the application of all laws listed in subsection (a).</p>
