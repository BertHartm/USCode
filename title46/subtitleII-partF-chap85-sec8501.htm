<p class="note-body">Section 8501 establishes the general proposition that the States regulate pilots in the bays, rivers, harbors, and ports of the United States, unless otherwise specifically provided by law.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) states this general proposition and uses the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; for emphasis on this point. Further, except as specifically provided in law, the Committee intends that this chapter not be construed to annul or affect any regulation established by the laws of a State requiring a vessel entering or leaving a port in that State to employ a pilot licensed or authorized by the laws of that State. In at least two places in current law, this general proposition is stated in both a positive and negative manner. The Committee intends <!-- PDFPage:133 -->to consolidate those separate statements into one provision to avoid ambiguity and redundancy.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsections (b) and (c) contain provisions regarding pilotage in waters between two States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (d) prohibits a State from requiring a State licensed pilot on certain coastwise vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (e) voids any regulation or provision violating this section.</p>
