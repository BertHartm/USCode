The words &ldquo;or any State thereof or the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or any territory or possession of the United States&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of &ldquo;United States&rdquo; in chapter 1 of the revised title.</p>
