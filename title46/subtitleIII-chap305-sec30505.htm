<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;Except as provided in section 30506 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;except in the cases provided for in subsection (b) of this section&rdquo; because 46 App. U.S.C. 183(b) is restated in section 30506 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;whether American or foreign&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of section 30502 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;shall not exceed the value of the vessel and pending freight&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. exceed the amount or value of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. such vessel, and her freight then pending&rdquo; in 46 App. U.S.C. 183(a) and for &ldquo;the aggregate liabilities of all the owners of a vessel on account of the same shall not exceed the value of such vessels and freight pending&rdquo; in 46 App. U.S.C. 189 for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words. The last sentence is substituted for &ldquo;the interest of such owner in&rdquo; in 46 App. U.S.C. 183(a) and for &ldquo;The individual liability of a shipowner shall be limited to the proportion of any or all debts and liabilities that his individual share of the vessel bears to the whole&rdquo; in 46 App. U.S.C. 189 for clarity and consistency. The words &ldquo;<em>Provided</em>, That this provision shall not prevent any claimant from joining all the owners in one action&rdquo; in 46 App. U.S.C. 189 are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c) is substituted for &ldquo;nor shall the same apply to wages due to persons employed by said shipowners&rdquo; in 46 App. U.S.C. 189 because of the reorganization of the source provisions.</p>
