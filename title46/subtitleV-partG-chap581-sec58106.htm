<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;United States Government&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;United States or any agency of the United States&rdquo; for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;bring a civil action&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;sue&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;without respect to the amount in controversy&rdquo; are omitted because section 1331 of title 28 no longer contains a requirement of any particular amount in controversy for jurisdiction of civil actions arising under the laws of the United States. The words &ldquo;If the person prevails&rdquo; are added for clarity.</p>
