<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;or to do any part of such towing&rdquo; and &ldquo;other than a vessel in distress&rdquo; in the source provision are made applicable to all the towing described in subsection (b) for clarity and consistency. In paragraph (1), the words &ldquo;wholly owned by citizens of the United States for purposes of engaging in the coastwise trade&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;wholly owned by a person who is a citizen of the United States within the meaning of the laws respecting the documentation of vessels&rdquo; for consistency in this chapter.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a)(2) is substituted for &ldquo;having in force a certificate of documentation issued under section 12106 of title 46&rdquo; for consistency in this chapter and with section 12102(b) as revised by the bill.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;in the United States to which the coastwise laws apply&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;in the United States, its Territories or possessions, embraced within the coastwise laws of the United States&rdquo; because of the definition of &ldquo;United States&rdquo; in chapter 1 of the revised title and because of section 55101 of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(3), the words &ldquo;or place&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;as defined in the Presidential <!-- PDFPage:373 -->Proclamation of March 10, 1983&rdquo; are omitted because &ldquo;exclusive economic zone&rdquo; is defined in chapter 1 of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the penalty amounts reflect the adjustment for inflation pursuant to the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (28 U.S.C. 2461 note). See 19 C.F.R. &sect;4.92 (2004). In paragraph (2), the words &ldquo;which sum may be recovered by way of libel or suit&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">The text of 46 App. U.S.C. 316(b) is omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo; in section 1 of title 1.</p>
