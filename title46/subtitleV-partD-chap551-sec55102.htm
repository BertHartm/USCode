<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1), the words &ldquo;(as defined in section 2101 of the [sic] title 46)&rdquo; are omitted because the definition of &ldquo;State&rdquo; is being moved to chapter 1 and will apply to the entire title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;may not provide any part of the transportation of&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;No .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall be transported&rdquo; and &ldquo;or for any part of the transportation&rdquo; because of the reorganization of the language. The words &ldquo;including Districts, Territories, and possessions thereof&rdquo; are omitted because of the definition of &ldquo;United States&rdquo; in chapter 1 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;to which the coastwise laws apply&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;embraced within the coastwise laws&rdquo; for consistency with section 55101. The words &ldquo;is wholly owned by citizens of the United States for purposes of engaging in the coastwise trade&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;owned by persons who are citizens of the United States&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;has been issued a certificate of documentation with a coastwise endorsement under chapter 121&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;documented under the laws of the United States&rdquo;, for clarity and consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;or is exempt from documentation but would otherwise be eligible for such a certificate and endorsement&rdquo; are added for consistency with section 12102 as revised by the bill. The requirement that the vessel be built in the United States is omitted from this section for consistency with the requirements for a coastwise endorsement, which also require that the vessel be built in the United States except in certain circumstances. The words &ldquo;or vessels to which the privilege of engaging in the coastwise trade is extended by section 808 of this Appendix or section 22 of this Act&rdquo; are omitted because the relevant portion of section 808, and section 22, have been repealed.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;any person&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;any consignor, seller, owner, importer, consignee, agent, or other person or persons&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
