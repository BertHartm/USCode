<p class="note-body">The American Fisheries Act (Public Law 105&ndash;277, div. C, title II) (16 U.S.C. 1851 note), referred to in subsec. (d)(2)(B), probably should be a reference to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (see note below). Subsec. (d)(2)(B) of this section was derived from former section 12102(c)(5)(B) of this title in the general amendment of this chapter by Pub. L. 109&ndash;304, &sect;5, Oct. 6, 2006, 120 Stat. 1491. As part of that amendment, the reference to the American Fisheries Act was substituted for a reference to &ldquo;such Act&rdquo; which had been preceded by references to both of the above named Acts. See the Historical and Revision Notes above and section 2 of Pub. L. 109&ndash;304, set out as a Legislative Purpose and Construction note preceding section 101 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, referred to in subsec. (g), is Pub.

<p class="note-body">In this section, the word &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;Secretary of the Treasury&rdquo;, thereby incorporating the definition of &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; in section 2101 of title 46. The functions of the Secretary of the Treasury relating to the Coast Guard previously were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation by section 6(b) of the Department of Transportation Act (Pub. L. 89&ndash;670, Oct. 15, 1966, 80 Stat. 938). The Coast Guard and the functions of the Secretary of Transportation relating to the Coast Guard were again transferred to the Department of Homeland Security by section 888(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107&ndash;296, Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2135).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1), the words &ldquo;seeking hereunder to document a vessel under the laws of the United States or to operate a vessel exempt from documentation under the laws of the United States&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of the reorganization of the section.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (d)(1)(B) is substituted for &ldquo;together with their owners or masters, shall be entitled to all the other benefits and privileges and shall be subject to the same requirements, penalties, and forfeitures as may be applicable in the case of vessels built in the United States and otherwise documented or exempt from documentation under the laws of the United States&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d)(2), the words before subparagraph (A) are substituted for &ldquo;no vessel owned by any such corporation shall engage in the fisheries or in the transportation of merchandise or passengers for hire between points in the United States, including Territories, Districts, and possessions thereof, embraced within the coastwise laws, except&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.

<h4 class="note-sub-head"><em>Revised section 12501</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) of section 12501 requires the Secretary of Transportation to establish a system of information concerning vessels of the United States for law enforcement and other purposes. The Secretary is required to make available information from the system relating to the ownership of vessels documented under chapter 121 of title 46, numbered under chapter 123 of that title, and titled under the law of a State. The information is available under section 12503 for use by the public, similarly under the Ship Mortgage Act, 1920.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) lists the vessel identification information which is required to be maintained by the Secretary. The Secretary has the authority to prescribe other information to be maintained in addition to the items listed. For example, the Secretary may identify vessels issued fisheries permits by the Department of Commerce. The Secretary may also monitor transactions involving vessels that require approval by the Secretary under section 9 of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 App. U.S.C. 808) before interest or control in the vessel may be transferred to a noncitizen.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c) clarifies that the Secretary has the flexibility to maintain this system in connection with any other information system maintained by the Secretary, including the Federal Aviation Administration system containing aircraft ownership information. This would also permit the Secretary to combine various systems and data bases maintained by the Secretary such as documentation and numbering of vessels, and safety, casualty, and law enforcement statistics.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head"><em>Revised section 12502</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) of this section requires the Secretary to maintain a unique numbering system for vessels of the United States. The Secretary may use existing vessel numbering systems such as the hull identification number for this purpose, but must ensure that no two existing vessels of the United States have the same number. The Secretary should consider and propose the use of a 17-digit number to implement this requirement. This subsection also requires the Secretary to maintain a system of signal letters and to record vessel names for documented vessels. The Secretary is authorized to establish other vessel identification markings for vessels of the United States, such as hailing ports.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head"><em>Revised section 12503</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) of section 12503 allows a State or approved State delegee to make vessel identification information available to the Secretary. Participation in the system is voluntary on the part of a State. A benefit to boat purchasers and financiers in States with approved titling systems participating in this system is that vessel mortgages or financing instruments made in those States are deemed to be preferred mortgages under chapter 313 of title 46, United States Code (as codified and enacted by this Act).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under subsection (a), the Secretary may prescribe the manner and form in which the information is made available by the States. In this regard, the Committee intends that the Secretary employ the most efficient, up-to-date computer technology in maintaining information made available from the States to avoid duplication of effort in maintaining information and to reduce the costs of the system. In addition to the vessel identification information made available by States under paragraphs (1)&ndash;(6), the Secretary and a State may agree that the State make available other information. For example, the purpose for which a vessel is routinely used would be valuable information for the system.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee intends that most of the information in the system will become available directly and exclusively from the States to the greatest extent possible. <!-- PDFPage:174 -->However, under subsection (b), the Secretary may accept information from others under conditions and in a manner and form prescribed by the Secretary. Thus, if the Secretary discovers a valuable and reliable source of data that can be conveniently made available to the system, the Secretary can approve it.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under paragraph (c)(1), the Secretary must maintain information on a State-titled vessel with a preferred mortgage that moves to a nonparticipating, nontitle State, until the mortgage is discharged or the vessel is sold. Under paragraph (c)(2), the Secretary must accept information submitted under section 31321 of title 46 (as enacted by this Act) concerning a discharge of a preferred mortgage on a vessel title under State law. This would be necessary if the vessel moves to a nonparticipating State, and information on that vessel would not be provided to the system by that State. This subsection will allow the Secretary to keep the vessel information system current on these matters and purge files no longer required to be maintained.</p>

<p class="note-body">This section contains the authority for the Secretary to charge a fee under the user charge law, 31 U.S.C. 9701, for providing information to or requesting information from the vessel identification system. Fees may not be charged under this subsection to an agency or a State that is participating in the vessel identification system maintained by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may collect an annual fee of not more than $1.00 from the owner of a vessel of the United States under 31 U.S.C. 9701 for the vessel identification system. Since vessel owners will benefit from the vessel identification system, such as from documentation of ownership data and stolen vessel tracking, this fee is designed as a maintenance charge to owners for this service. The collection of the annual fee may be delayed by the Secretary, and an agency, State, or person may be employed to collect the fee under subsection (c). The Committee expects that the Secretary will make agreements with States to collect this fee at the time of vessel registrations. The term of these registrations varies from one to three years as permitted by chapter 123 of title 46.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under subsection (d) of this section, if a State is employed to collect the fee, the State may retain one-half of the amounts collected, and must transfer the remainder to the Secretary. The amounts retained by a State may be used to cover the costs of making vessel identification information available to the Secretary. This includes upgrading or establishing titling systems as well as making improvements and other changes to vessel numbering systems to make information available. Because States are allowed to make improvements to their vessel titling and numbering systems with the amounts retained under this section, the costs of those programs may decrease. This could result in a corresponding decrease in State numbering fees and offset vessel identification system fees paid by vessel owners.</p>
