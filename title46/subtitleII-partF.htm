<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a tank vessel shall consider the navigation, cargo handling, and maintenance functions of that vessel for protection of life, property, and the environment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:94 --><p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary may modify the complement, by endorsement on the certificate, for reasons of changed conditions or employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A requirement made under this section by an authorized official may be appealed to the Secretary under prescribed regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A vessel to which this section applies may not be operated without having in its service the complement required in the certificate of inspection.</p>

The replacements must be of the same or a higher grade or rating than those whose places they fill. If the master finds the vessel is sufficiently manned for the voyage, and replacements are not available to fill all the vacancies, the vessel may proceed on its voyage. Within 12 hours after the vessel arrives at its destination, the master shall report in writing to the Secretary the cause of each deficiency in the complement. A master failing to make the report is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of $1,000 for each deficiency.</p>

The vessel also is liable in rem for the penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) When the 2 next most senior licensed officers on a vessel reasonably believe that the master or individual in charge of the vessel is under the influence of alcohol or a dangerous drug and is incapable of commanding the vessel, the next most senior master, mate, or operator licensed under section 7101(c)(1) or (3) of this title shall&mdash;</p>

However, if the master finds the vessel sufficiently manned and replacements are not available, the vessel may proceed on its voyage. Within 12 hours of arrival at its destination, the master is required to file a written report with the Secretary stating the cause of each deficiency or be liable for a civil penalty. The report of deficiency should include both the reason for the vacancy in the first instance and the reason for the unavailability of a qualified replacement.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 8103 sets forth the requirements for citizenship and Naval Reserve membership for the complement on a vessel documented under the laws of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) requires that the master, chief engineer, or officer in charge of a deck or engineering watch on a United States documented vessel be a United States citizen.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) requires that 75 percent of the seamen, excluding licensed individuals, on a United States documented vessel be United States citizens, except for a fishing or whaling vessel or yacht. The Secretary may reduce the percentage if the Secretary decides on investigation that United States seamen are not available. This investigation and percentage reduction authority is the sole responsibility of the Secretary of Transportation and accordingly the Secretary is to make these decisions expeditiously, promptly, and independently so as not to be dependent on any other agency to make this reduction. The Committee believes the Secretary is capable of this decision and need not delay or fail to make the decision because some other agency does not have the information or would require an extended period to acquire that information. The phrase &ldquo;for any reason&rdquo; is used merely to emphasize the complete discretion of the Secretary in making this decision. In addition, because this decision is based on an investigation, formal procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act do not apply.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsections (c) and (d) provide that a vessel, except a passenger vessel, on departure from the United States that has been granted a construction or operating differential subsidy have a higher percentage citizenship requirement. Subsection (c) requires all of the crew and employees of a cargo vessel be United States citizens. Subsection (d) requires at least 90 percent of the entire complement of a passenger vessel be United States citizens. The phrase &ldquo;including all licensed individuals&rdquo; emphasizes that all licensed individuals are required to be United States citizens as required by subsection (a) and that they compose part of the 90 percent requirement under this subsection. Further, under subsection (d), the balance of the complement must be individuals who have a declaration of intention to become a United States citizen or evidence of admission to the United States as a permanent resident and may only be employed in the steward's department of the passenger vessel.</p>
<p class="note-body">Except for the master, subsection (e) permits a non-United States citizen to fill a vacancy that occurs for any reason on a United States documented vessel during a foreign voyage until the vessel returns to a United States port where a United States citizen replacement can be obtained. The phrase &ldquo;for any reason&rdquo; is used merely for emphasis.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (f) provides for the penalty for violation of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (g) requires a deck or engineer officer on a vessel that has been granted an operating differential subsidy or is under the control by the Department of Transportation to be, if eligible, a member of the Naval Reserve. This section does not apply to a vessel of the Coast Guard or the Saint Lawrance Seaway Development Corporation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (h) permits the President to suspend the requirements of this section during a proclaimed national emergency or the requirement of subsection (a) for United States vessels documented for foreign trade when the needs of commerce require.</p>

<p class="note-body">For the Great Lakes towing vessels and merchant vessels in subsections (c) and (d(, subsection (e) requires that seamen be hired only for work in either the deck or the engine department. When in a safe harbor, seamen may be required to do only necessary work on Sundays and certain holidays, unless the vessel is getting underway on a voyage. Further, when in a safe harbor, this subsection restates the maximum 8-hour work day which applies even for anchor watch.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (f) states that the limitations in subsections (d) and (e) do not apply if the master or other officer decides the crew is needed for certain routine, safety, or rescue activities.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (g) provides that for a towing vessel (except a Great Lakes towing vessel under subsection (c)), offshore supply vessel, or barge on a voyage of less than <!-- PDFPage:99 -->600 miles, the licensed officers and certain crewmembers may be divided into not less than two watches when at sea.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Chapter 85 provides for State pilotage to be regulated by the States and only in conformity with the laws of the States. It clearly spells out the preeminence of the State's role in regulating pilots for vessels operating on the bays, rivers, harbors, and ports of the United States. However, those vessels that are required to have a Federally licensed pilot, those that operate on waters outside the territorial sea of the United States, and those that operate on waters of the Great Lakes are not subject to State pilotage laws or requirements. In essence this chapter, with minor changes, confirms the State and Federal relationship with respect to pilotage that has evolved since the founding of the Nation.</p>
<p class="note-body">This chapter permits the continuation of Federal pilotage requirements for vessels that are not required to obtain compulsory State pilotage. It confirms the practice of allowing anyone with a Federal pilotage endorsement for the waters in which the vessel is operating to be in control of a vessel when engaged in the coastwide trade. It also confirms the practice of using Federal pilots that are often organized into groups or working organizations who offer their expertise and services to vessels that are not required to obtain compulsory State pilotage.</p>
