<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section applies to a person who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) after July 31, 1990, is ordered to active duty (other than for training) pursuant to section 688, 12301(a), 12301(g), 12302, 12304, 12306, or 12307 of title 10, United States Code, or who is ordered to active duty under section 12301(d) of such title during a period when members are on active duty pursuant to any of the preceding sections; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) immediately before receiving the order to active duty&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) was engaged in the furnishing of health-care services or other services determined by the Secretary of Defense to be professional services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) had in effect a professional liability insurance policy that does not continue to cover claims filed with respect to such person during the period of the person's active duty unless the premiums are paid for such coverage for such period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Suspension of coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Coverage of a person referred to in subsection (a) by a professional liability insurance policy shall be suspended in accordance with this subsection upon receipt of the written request of such person by the insurance carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A professional liability insurance carrier&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may not require that premiums be paid by or on behalf of a person for any professional liability insurance coverage suspended pursuant to paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall refund any amount paid for coverage for the period of such suspension or, upon the election of such person, apply such amount for the payment of any premium becoming due upon the reinstatement of such coverage.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A professional liability insurance carrier shall not be liable with respect to any claim that is based on professional conduct (including any failure to take any action in a professional capacity) of a person that occurs during a period of suspension of that person's professional liability insurance under this subsection. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, a claim based upon the failure of a professional to make adequate provision for patients to be cared for during the period of the professional's active duty service shall be considered to be based on an action or failure to take action before the beginning of the period of suspension of professional <!-- PDFPage:119 -->liability insurance under this subsection, except in a case in which professional services were provided after the date of the beginning of such period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reinstatement of coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Professional liability insurance coverage suspended in the case of any person pursuant to subsection (b) shall be reinstated by the insurance carrier on the date on which that person transmits to the insurance carrier a written request for reinstatement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The request of a person for reinstatement shall be effective only if the person transmits the request to the insurance carrier within 30 days after the date on which the person is released from active duty. The insurance carrier shall notify the person of the due date for payment of the premium of such insurance. Such premium shall be paid by the person within 30 days after the receipt of that notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The period for which professional liability insurance coverage shall be reinstated for a person under this subsection may not be less than the balance of the period for which coverage would have continued under the insurance policy if the coverage had not been suspended.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Increase in premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An insurance carrier may not increase the amount of the premium charged for professional liability insurance coverage of any person for the minimum period of the reinstatement of such coverage required under subsection (c)(3) to an amount greater than the amount chargeable for such coverage for such period before the suspension, except to the extent of any general increase in the premium amounts charged by that carrier for the same professional liability coverage for persons similarly covered by such insurance during the period of the suspension.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Continuation of coverage of unaffected persons</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section does not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) require a suspension of professional liability insurance coverage for any person who is not a person referred to in subsection (a) and who is covered by the same professional liability insurance as a person referred to in such subsection; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) relieve any person of the obligation to pay premiums for the coverage not required to be suspended.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Stay of civil or administrative actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A civil or administrative action for damages on the basis of the alleged professional negligence or other professional liability of a person whose professional liability insurance coverage has been suspended under subsection (b) shall be stayed until the end of the period of the suspension if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the action was commenced during that period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the action is based on an act or omission that occurred before the date on which the suspension became effective; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the suspended professional liability insurance would, except for the suspension, on its face cover the alleged professional negligence or other professional liability negligence or other professional liability of the person.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever a civil or administrative action for damages is stayed under paragraph (1) in the case of any person, the action shall be deemed to have been filed on the date on which the professional liability insurance coverage of such person is reinstated under subsection (c).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Effect of suspension upon limitations period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a civil or administrative action for which a stay could have been granted under subsection (f) by reason of the suspension of professional liability insurance coverage of the defendant under this section, the period of the suspension of the coverage shall be excluded from the computation of any statutory period of limitation on the commencement of such action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Death during period of suspension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a person whose professional liability insurance coverage is suspended under subsection (b) dies during the period of the suspension&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the requirement for the grant or continuance of a stay in any civil or administrative action against such person under subsection (f)(1) shall terminate on the date of the death of such person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the carrier of the professional liability insurance so suspended shall be liable for any claim for damages for professional negligence or other professional liability of the deceased person in the same manner and to the same extent as such carrier would be liable if the person had died while covered by such insurance but before the claim was filed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;active duty&rdquo; has the meaning given that term in section 101 of title 10, United States Code.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;profession&rdquo; includes occupation.</p>
