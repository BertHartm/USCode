<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Receipt of proposal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the second sentence of section 7(a) [section 1941e(a) of this Appendix], the period for receipt of proposals for the purchase of the Government-owned rubber-producing facility at Baytown, Texas, known as Plancor Numbered 877, shall not expire until the end of the thirty-day period which begins on the date of the enactment of this section [Mar. 31, 1955].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Negotiation period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If one or more proposals are received for the purchase of Plancor Numbered 877 within the time period specified in subsection (a), the Commission, notwithstanding the expiration of the period for negotiation specified in section 7 (f) [section 1941e(f) of this Appendix], shall negotiate with those submitting the proposals for a period of not to exceed sixty days for the purpose of entering into a definite contract of sale.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Report to Congress; transfer period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within ten days after the termination of the actual negotiation period referred to in subsection (b), the Commission shall prepare and submit to the Congress a report containing, with respect to the disposal under this section of Plancor Numbered 877, the information described in paragraphs (1) to (5), inclusive, and paragraph (8) of section 9(a) [section 1941g(a) of this Appendix]. Unless the contract is disapproved by either House of the Congress by a resolution prior to the expiration of thirty days of continuous session (as defined in section 9(c) [section 1941g(c) of this Appendix]) of the Congress following the date upon which the report is submitted to it, upon the expiration of such thirty-day period the contract shall become fully effective and the Commission shall proceed to carry it out, and transfer of possession of the facility sold shall be made as soon as practicable but in any event within thirty days after the expiration of such thirty-day period. The failure to complete transfer of possession within thirty days after the expiration of the period for congressional review shall not give rise to or be the basis of rescission of the contract of sale.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Standby condition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, upon termination of the transfer period provided for in subsection (c), no contract for the sale of Plancor Numbered 877 has become effective, the operating agency last designated by the President shall, as promptly as possible consistent with sound operating procedures, take said Plancor out of production and place it in adequate standby condition under the provisions of section 8 of the Rubber Producing Facilities Disposal Act of 1953 [section 1941f of this Appendix]: <em>Provided</em>, That the provisions in said section relating to the time for placing facilities in standby condition shall not apply to Plancor Numbered 877.</p>

As promptly as practicable following the date of transfer of possession of Plancor Numbered 877 to a purchaser under this Act, the operating agency last designated by the President shall offer for sale to such purchaser the end products produced at such plant and held in inventory for Government account on the day of such transfer of possession, together with the feedstocks then located at such plant or purchased by the operating agency for use at such plant. Sale of such end products shall be made at the Government sales price prevailing on the business day next preceding the date of transfer of possession of such plant.

In the event the purchaser declines to purchase such end products or feedstocks when first offered to it by the operating agency, they may be thereafter disposed of in such manner as the operating agen<!-- PDFPage:179 -->cy deems advisable. In the event Plancor Numbered 877 is not sold under the provisions of this Act, any end products produced at such plant and held in inventory for Government account on the day such plant is placed in standby condition pursuant to section 25(d) of the Rubber Producing Facilities Disposal Act of 1953, as added by this Act [subsec.

Each such lease may be for such duration and each such lease or contract of sale may be made on such terms (including type of use) as the Commission or such other agency deems advisable in the public interest: <em>Provided</em>, That each such lease or contract of sale shall contain, among other provisions, a national security clause, and each such lease shall contain provisions for the recapture of the tank cars leased by the Government and the termination of the lease, if the President determines that the national interest so requires. The rental or price for any such tank car or cars shall be an amount which the Commission or such agency determines to be the maximum amount obtainable in the public interest, but not less than fair value as determined by the Commission. Any of such tank cars not under lease or contract of sale to non-Federal lessees or purchasers may be transferred without charge by the Commission or such agency to any Government department or agency upon request, for such use as the Commission or such agency deems advisable and subject to national security and recapture provisions of the type hereinabove provided for in this section running in favor of the Commission or other agency transferring the tank car or cars.
