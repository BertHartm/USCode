<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2527. Nuclear test ban readiness program</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) On September 17, 1987, the United States and the Soviet Union announced that they would resume full-scale, stage-by-stage negotiations on issues relating to nuclear testing, including further intermediate limitations on nuclear testing leading to the ultimate objective of a comprehensive nuclear test ban.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) It was agreed that the first step in these negotiations would be to reach agreement on verification measures that will make possible the ratification of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty of 1974 and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty of 1976.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To achieve the agreement on verification measures, the United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to design and conduct a Joint Verification Experiment at the test sites of each country during the summer of 1988.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) At the Moscow summit in May 1988, President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev reaffirmed their commitment to negotiations on &ldquo;effective verification measures which will make it possible to ratify the Threshold Test Ban Treaty of 1974 and Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty of 1976, and proceed to negotiating further intermediate limitations on nuclear testing leading to the ultimate objective of the complete cessation of nuclear testing as part of an effective disarmament process&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment of program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Energy shall establish and support a program to assure that the United States is in a position to maintain the reliability, safety, and continued deterrent effect of its stockpile of existing nuclear weapons designs in the event that a low-threshold or comprehensive ban on nuclear explosives testing is negotiated and ratified within the framework agreed to by the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Purposes of program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of the program under subsection (b) shall be the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To assure that the United States maintains a vigorous program of stockpile inspec<!-- PDFPage:453 -->tion and non-explosive testing so that, if a low-threshold or comprehensive test ban is entered into, the United States remains able to detect and identify potential problems in stockpile reliability and safety in existing designs of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To assure that the specific materials, components, processes, and personnel needed for the remanufacture of existing nuclear weapons or the substitution of alternative nuclear warheads are available to support such remanufacture or substitution if such action becomes necessary in order to satisfy reliability and safety requirements under a low-threshold or comprehensive test ban agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To assure that a vigorous program of research in areas related to nuclear weapons science and engineering is supported so that, if a low-threshold or comprehensive test ban agreement is entered into, the United States is able to maintain a base of technical knowledge about nuclear weapons design and nuclear weapons effects.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Conduct of program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Energy shall carry out the program provided for in subsection (b). The program shall be carried out with the participation of representatives of the Department of Defense, the nuclear weapons production facilities, and the national nuclear weapons laboratories.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Plan required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Energy shall develop a plan to transform the nuclear weapons complex so as to achieve a responsive infrastructure by 2030. The plan shall be designed to accomplish the following objectives:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To maintain the safety, reliability, and security of the United States nuclear weapons stockpile.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To continue Stockpile Life Extension Programs that the Nuclear Weapons Council considers necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To prepare to produce replacement warheads under the Reliable Replacement Warhead program at a rate necessary to meet future stockpile requirements, commencing with a first production unit in 2012 and achieving steady-state production using modern manufacturing processes by 2025.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To eliminate, within the nuclear weapons complex, duplication of production capability except to the extent required to ensure the safety, reliability, and security of the stockpile.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To maintain the current philosophy within the national security laboratories of peer review of nuclear weapons designs while eliminating duplication of laboratory capabilities except to the extent required to ensure the safety, reliability, and security of the stockpile.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:457 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) To maintain the national security mission, and in particular the science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program, as the primary mission of the national security laboratories while optimizing the work-for-others activities of those laboratories to support other national security objectives in fields such as defense, intelligence, and homeland security.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) To consolidate to the maximum extent practicable, and to provide for the ultimate disposition of, special nuclear material throughout the nuclear weapons complex, with the ultimate goal of eliminating Category I and II special nuclear material from the national security laboratories no later than March 1, 2012, so as to further reduce the footprint of the nuclear weapons complex, reduce security costs, and reduce transportation costs for special nuclear material. This objective does not preclude the retention of Category I and II special nuclear materials at a national security laboratory if the transformation plan required by this subsection envisions a pit production capability (including interim pit production) at a national security laboratory.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) To employ a risk-based approach to ensure compliance with Design Basis Threat security requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) To expeditiously dismantle inactive nuclear weapons to reduce the size of the stockpile to the lowest level required by the Nuclear Weapons Council.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) To operate the nuclear weapons complex in a more cost-effective manner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than February 1, 2007, the Secretary of Energy shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report on the transformation plan required by subsection (a). The report shall address each of the objectives required by subsection (c)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2534_1_target" name="2534_1">1</a></sup> and also include each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A comprehensive list of the capabilities, facilities, and project staffing that the National Nuclear Security Administration will need to have in place at the nuclear weapons complex as of 2030 to meet the requirements of the transformation plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A comprehensive list of the capabilities and facilities that the National Nuclear Security Administration currently has in place at the nuclear weapons complex that will not be needed as of 2030 to meet the requirements of the transformation plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A plan for implementing the transformation plan, including a schedule with incremental milestones.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Energy shall develop the transformation plan required by subsection (a) in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Nuclear Weapons Council.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definition</h4>
