<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Invocation of authorities; judicial review prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) At any time after the date of the enactment of this section [June 30, 1980], the President may, subject to paragraph (2), invoke the authorities provided under this section upon making all the following determinations and transmitting a report to the Congress regarding such determinations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a national energy supply shortage has resulted or is likely to result in a shortfall of petroleum supplies in the United States, and such shortage is expected to persist for a period of time sufficient to seriously threaten the adequacy of defense fuel supplies essential to direct defense and direct defense industrial base programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the continued adequacy of such supplies cannot be assured and requires expedited production of synthetic fuel to provide such defense fuel supplies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the expedited production of synthetic fuel to provide such defense fuel supplies will not be accomplished in a timely manner by the United States Synthetic Fuels Corporation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the exercise of the authorities provided under subsection (c) is necessary to provide for the expedited production of synthetic fuel to provide such defense fuel supplies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Any transmittal under paragraph (1) shall contain a determination by the President regarding the extent of the anticipated shortage of petroleum supplies. If the President determines that such shortage is greater than 25 percent, the authorities invoked by the President under this section shall be effective on the date on which the report required under paragraph (1) is transmitted to the Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the President determines that such shortage is less than 25 percent, the transmittal <!-- PDFPage:236 -->under paragraph (1) shall be made in accordance with section 307&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2096_1_target" name="2096_1">1</a></sup> [section 2097 of this Appendix] and the authorities under this section shall be effective only as provided under such section. For purposes of section 307&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2096_1_target" name="2096_1">1</a></sup> [section 2097 of this Appendix], any determination to invoke authorities under this section, notice of which is transmitted to the Congress under this subsection, shall be considered to be a synthetic fuel action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purpose of determining the maximum liability under any contract under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) loans shall be valued at the initial face value of the loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) guarantees shall be valued at the initial face value of such guarantee (including any amount of interest which is guaranteed under such guarantee);</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If more than one form of assistance is provided under this section to any synthetic fuel project then the maximum liability under such contract for purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be valued at the maximum potential exposure on such project at any time during the life of such project.</p>

Guaranteeing agencies shall not extend guarantees and the President shall not make loans for the construction, repair or alteration of any synthetic fuel project unless a certification is provided to the agency or the President, as the case may be, prior to the commencement of construction or at the time of filing an application for a loan or guarantee, if construction has already commenced, that these labor standards will be maintained at the synthetic fuel project. With respect to the labor standards specified in this subsection, the Secretary of Labor shall have the authority and functions set forth in Reorganization Plan Numbered 14 of 1950.</p>
