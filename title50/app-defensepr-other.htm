<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the security of the United States is dependent on the ability of the domestic industrial base to supply materials and services for the national defense and to prepare for and respond to military conflicts, natural or man-caused disasters, or acts of terrorism within the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to ensure the vitality of the domestic industrial base, actions are needed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to promote industrial resources preparedness in the event of domestic or foreign threats to the security of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to support continuing improvements in industrial efficiency and responsiveness;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to provide for the protection and restoration of domestic critical infrastructure operations under emergency conditions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to respond to actions taken outside of the United States that could result in reduced supplies of strategic and critical materials, including energy, necessary for national defense and the general economic well-being of the United States;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in order to provide for the national security, the national defense preparedness effort of the United States Government requires&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) preparedness programs to respond to both domestic emergencies and international threats to national defense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) measures to improve the domestic industrial base for national defense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the development of domestic productive capacity to meet&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) essential national defense needs that can result from emergency conditions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) unique technological requirements; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the diversion of certain materials and facilities from ordinary use to national defense purposes, when national defense needs cannot otherwise be satisfied in a timely fashion;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to meet the requirements referred to in this subsection, this Act [sections 2061 to 2170, 2171, and 2172 of this Appendix] provides the President with an array of authorities to shape national defense preparedness programs and to take appropriate steps to maintain and enhance the domestic industrial base;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) in order to ensure national defense preparedness, it is necessary and appropriate to assure the availability of domestic energy supplies for national defense needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to further assure the adequate maintenance of the domestic industrial base, to the maximum extent possible, domestic energy supplies should be augmented through reliance on renewable energy sources (including solar, geothermal, wind, and biomass sources), more efficient energy storage and distribution technologies, and energy conservation measures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) much of the industrial capacity that is relied upon by the United States Government for military production and other national defense purposes is deeply and directly influenced by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the overall competitiveness of the industrial economy of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the ability of industries in the United States, in general, to produce internationally competitive products and operate profitably while maintaining adequate research and development to preserve competitiveness with respect to military and civilian production; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the inability of industries in the United States, especially smaller subcontractors and suppliers, to provide vital parts and components and other materials would impair the ability to sustain the Armed Forces of the United States in combat for longer than a short period.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:222 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Statement of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the United States that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to ensure the adequacy of productive capacity and supply, Federal departments and agencies that are responsible for national defense acquisition should continuously assess the capability of the domestic industrial base to satisfy production requirements under both peacetime and emergency conditions, specifically evaluating the availability of adequate production sources, including subcontractors and suppliers, materials, skilled labor, and professional and technical personnel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) every effort should be made to foster cooperation between the defense and commercial sectors for research and development and for acquisition of materials, components, and equipment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) plans and programs to carry out the purposes of this Act [sections 2061 to 2170, 2171, and 2172 of this Appendix] should be undertaken with due consideration for promoting efficiency and competition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in providing United States Government financial assistance under this Act [sections 2061 to 2170, 2171, and 2172 of this Appendix] to correct a domestic industrial base shortfall, the President should give consideration to the creation or maintenance of production sources that will remain economically viable after such assistance has ended;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) authorities under this Act [sections 2061 to 2170, 2171, and 2172 of this Appendix] should be used to reduce the vulnerability of the United States to terrorist attacks, and to minimize the damage and assist in the recovery from terrorist attacks that occur in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) in order to ensure productive capacity in the event of an attack on the United States, the United States Government should encourage the geographic dispersal of industrial facilities in the United States to discourage the concentration of such productive facilities within limited geographic areas that are vulnerable to attack by an enemy of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to ensure that essential national defense requirements are met, consideration should be given to stockpiling strategic materials, to the extent that such stockpiling is economical and feasible; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) in the construction of any industrial facility owned by the United States Government, in the rendition of any financial assistance by the United States Government for the construction, expansion, or improvement of any industrial facility, and in the production of goods and services, under this Act [sections 2061 to 2170, 2171, and 2172 of this Appendix] or any other provision of law, each department and agency of the United States Government should apply, under the coordination of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, when practicable and consistent with existing law and the desirability for maintaining a sound economy, the principle of geographic dispersal of such facilities in the interest of national defense.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Expediting production and deliveries or services</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authorized activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To reduce current or projected shortfalls of industrial resources, critical technology items, or essential materials needed for national defense purposes, subject to such regulations as the President may prescribe, the President may authorize a guaranteeing agency to provide guarantees of loans by private institutions for the purpose of financing any contractor, subcontractor, provider of critical infrastructure, or other person in support of production capabilities or supplies that are deemed by the guaranteeing agency to be necessary to create, maintain, expedite, expand, protect, or restore production and deliveries or services essential to the national defense.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Presidential determinations required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except during a period of national emergency declared by Congress or the President, a loan guarantee may be entered into under this section only if the President determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the loan guarantee is for an activity that supports the production or supply of an industrial resource, critical technology item, or material that is essential for national defense purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) without a loan guarantee, credit is not available to the loan applicant under reasonable terms or conditions sufficient to finance the activity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the loan guarantee is the most cost effective, expedient, and practical alternative for meeting the needs of the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the prospective earning power of the loan applicant and the character and value of the security pledged provide a reasonable assurance of repayment of the loan to be guaranteed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the loan to be guaranteed bears interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be reasonable, taking into account the then-current average yield on outstanding obligations of the United States with remaining periods of maturity comparable to the maturity of the loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the loan agreement for the loan to be guaranteed provides that no provision of the loan agreement may be amended or waived without the consent of the fiscal agent of the United States for the guarantee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the loan applicant has provided or will provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an assurance of repayment, as determined by the President; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) security&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) in the form of a performance bond, insurance, collateral, or other means acceptable to the fiscal agent of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) in an amount equal to not less than 20 percent of the amount of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitations on loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Loans under this section may be&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:228 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) made or guaranteed under the authority of this section only to the extent that an appropriations Act&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) provides, in advance, budget authority for the cost of such guarantees, as defined in section 502 of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. 661a); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) establishes a limitation on the total loan principal that may be guaranteed; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) made without regard to the limitations of existing law, other than section 1341 of title 31, United States Code.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Fiscal agents of the United States</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any Federal agency or any Federal reserve bank, when designated by the President, is hereby authorized to act, on behalf of any guaranteeing agency, as fiscal agent of the United States in the making of such contracts of guarantee and in otherwise carrying out the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All such funds as may be necessary to enable any fiscal agent described in paragraph (1) to carry out any guarantee made by it on behalf of any guaranteeing agency shall be supplied and disbursed by or under authority from such guaranteeing agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limit on liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No fiscal agent described in paragraph (1) shall have any responsibility or accountability, except as agent in taking any action pursuant to or under authority of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Reimbursements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each fiscal agent described in paragraph (1) shall be reimbursed by each guaranteeing agency for all expenses and losses incurred by such fiscal agent in acting as agent on behalf of such guaranteeing agency, including, notwithstanding any other provision of law, attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses of litigation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Oversight</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All actions and operations of fiscal agents under authority of or pursuant to this section shall be subject to the supervision of the President, and to such regulations as the President may prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President is authorized to prescribe&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) either specifically or by maximum limits or otherwise, rates of interest, guarantee and commitment fees, and other charges which may be made in connection with loans, discounts, advances, or commitments guaranteed by the guaranteeing agencies through fiscal agents under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) regulations governing the forms and procedures (which shall be uniform to the extent practicable) to be utilized in connection with such guarantees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Aggregate guarantee amounts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Industrial resource and critical technology shortfalls</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the making of any guarantee or obligation of the Federal Government under this title [sections 2091 to 2094 of this Appendix] relating to a domestic industrial base shortfall would cause the aggregate outstanding amount of all guarantees for such shortfall to exceed $50,000,000, any such guarantee may be made only&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if the President has notified the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives in writing of the proposed guarantee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) after the 30-day period following the date on which notice under clause (i) is provided.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Waivers authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The requirements of subparagraph (A) may be waived&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) during a period of national emergency declared by Congress or the President; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) upon a determination by the President, on a nondelegable basis, that a specific guarantee is necessary to avert an industrial resource or critical technology item shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The authority conferred by this section shall not be used primarily to prevent the financial insolvency or bankruptcy of any person, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the President certifies that the insolvency or bankruptcy would have a direct and substantially adverse effect upon national defense production; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a copy of the certification under subparagraph (A), together with a detailed justification thereof, is transmitted to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives not later than 10 days prior to the exercise of that authority for such use.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) A fair business environment is necessary to advance international trade, economic stability, and development worldwide, is beneficial for American workers and businesses, and is in the United States national interest.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In some cases, mandated offset requirements can cause economic distortions in international defense trade and undermine fairness and competitiveness, and may cause particular harm to small- and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The use of offsets may lead to increasing dependence on foreign suppliers for the production of United States weapons systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The offset demands required by some purchasing countries, including some close allies of the United States, equal or exceed the value of the base contract they are intended to offset, mitigating much of the potential economic benefit of the exports.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Offset demands often unduly distort the prices of defense contracts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In some cases, United States contractors are required to provide indirect offsets which can negatively impact nondefense industrial sectors.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Unilateral efforts by the United States to prohibit offsets may be impractical in the current era of globalization and would severely hinder the competitiveness of the United States defense industry in the global market.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The development of global standards to manage and restrict demands for offsets would enhance United States efforts to mitigate the negative impact of offsets.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Declaration of Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the United States to monitor the use of offsets in international defense trade, to promote fairness in such trade, and to ensure that foreign participation in the production of United States weapons systems does not harm the economy of the United States.</p>
