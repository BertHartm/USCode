<p class="statutory-body">(1) As part of the recruitment and training program, the directors of the laboratories referred to in subsection (a)(1) may employ undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows to carry out research sponsored by such laboratories for military or nonmilitary dual-use programs related to nuclear weapons stockpile stewardship.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of Energy in section 3101(a)(1) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 (Public Law 103&ndash;337) for weapons activities for core research and development and allocated by the Secretary for education initiatives, $5,000,000 shall be available for employing students and fellows to carry out research referred to in paragraph (1). The amount available under this paragraph shall be allocated equally among the laboratories referred to in subsection (a)(1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Establishment of retiree corps</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As part of the training and recruitment program, the Secretary, in coordination with the directors of the laboratories referred to in subsection (a)(1), shall establish for the laboratories a retiree corps of retired scientists who have expertise in research and development of nuclear weapons. The directors may employ the retired scientists on a part-time basis to provide appropriate assistance on nuclear weapons issues, to contribute relevant information to be archived, and to help to provide training to other scientists.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than February 1, 1995, the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives a report on the demographic trends of the personnel of the laboratories referred to in subsection (a)(1) and on actions taken by the Department of Energy to remedy identified deficiencies in various skill areas.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) For each laboratory, the number of scientists needed in each skill area to perform such tasks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The number of the scientists providing services in each skill area at each laboratory, stated by age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) An assessment of which skill areas are understaffed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) The number of scientists entering the weapons program at each laboratory, and their skill areas.</p>
