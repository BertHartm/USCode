<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Presidential provisions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To assist in carrying out the objectives of this Act [sections 2061 to 2171 of this Appendix], the President may make provision&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for purchases of or commitments to purchase an industrial resource or a critical technology item, for Government use or resale; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for the encouragement of exploration, development, and mining of critical and strategic materials, and other materials.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of certain agricultural commodities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Purchases for resale under this subsection shall not include that part of the supply of an agricultural commodity which is domestically produced, except to the extent that such domestically produced supply may be purchased for resale for industrial use or stockpiling.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Terms of sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No commodity purchased under this subsection shall be sold at less than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the established ceiling price for such commodity, except that minerals, metals, and materials shall not be sold at less than the established ceiling price, or the current domestic market price, whichever is lower; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if no ceiling price has been established, the higher of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the current domestic market price for such commodity; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the minimum sale price established for agricultural commodities owned or controlled by the Commodity Credit Corporation, as provided in section 407 of the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1427].</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Delivery dates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No purchase or commitment to purchase any imported agricultural commodity shall specify a delivery date which is more than 1 year after the expiration of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Presidential determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (7), the President may not execute a contract under this subsection unless the President determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the industrial resource or critical technology item is essential to the national defense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) without Presidential action under the authority provided for in this section, United States industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the capability for the needed industrial resource or critical technology item in a timely manner;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) purchases, purchase commitments, or other action pursuant to this section are the most cost-effective, expedient, and practical alternative method for meeting the need; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the combination of the United States national defense demand and foreseeable nondefense demand for the industrial resource or critical technology item is not less than the output of domestic industrial capability, as determined by the President, including the output to be established through the purchase, purchase commitment, or other action.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Identification of shortfall</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in paragraph (7), the President shall take no action under this <!-- PDFPage:229 -->section unless the industrial resource shortfall which such action is intended to correct has been identified in the Budget of the United States, or amendments thereto, submitted to the Congress and accompanied by a statement from the President demonstrating that the budget submission is in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (5).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Timing of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any such action may be taken only after 60 days have elapsed after such industrial resource shortfall has been identified pursuant to subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the taking of any action or actions under this section to correct an industrial resource shortfall would cause the aggregate outstanding amount of all such actions for such industrial resource shortfall to exceed $50,000,000, any such action or actions may be taken only if specifically authorized by law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirements of paragraphs (1) through (6) may be waived&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) during periods of national emergency declared by the Congress or the President; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) upon a determination by the President, on a nondelegable basis, that a specific guarantee is necessary to avert an industrial resource or critical technology item shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms and conditions of purchase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the limitations in subsection (a) of this section, purchases and commitments to purchase and sales under such subsection may be made without regard to the limitations of existing law, for such quantities, and on such terms and conditions, including advance payments, and for such periods, but not extending beyond a date that is not more than 10 years from the date such purchase, purchase commitment, or sale was initially made, as the President deems necessary, except that purchases or commitments to purchase involving higher than established ceiling prices (or if there be no established ceiling prices, currently prevailing market prices) or anticipated loss on resale shall not be made unless it is determined that supply of the materials could not be effectively increased at lower prices or on terms more favorable to the Government or that such purchases are necessary to assure the availability to the United States of overseas supplies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Subsidy payments on domestically produced materials; exclusion of agricultural products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the President finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that under generally fair and equitable ceiling prices for any raw or nonprocessed material, there will result a decrease in supplies from high-costs sources of such material, and that the continuation of such supplies is necessary to carry out the objectives of the Act [sections 2061 to 2171 of this Appendix]; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that an increase in cost of transportation is temporary in character and threatens to impair maximum production or supply in any area at stable prices of any materials;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">he may make provision for subsidy payments on any such domestically produced material other than an agricultural commodity in such amounts and in such manner (including purchases of such material and its resale at a loss without regard to the limitations of existing law), and on such terms and conditions, as he determines to be necessary to insure that supplies from such high-cost sources are continued, or that maximum production or supply in such area at stable prices of such materials is maintained, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Transportation, storage, and processing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The procurement power granted to the President by this section shall include the power to transport and store and have processed and refined, any materials procured under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Installation of equipment in industrial facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When in his judgment it will aid the national defense, the President is authorized to install additional equipment, facilities, processes or improvements to plants, factories, and other industrial facilities owned by the United States Government, and to install government-owned equipment in plants, factories, and other industrial facilities owned by private persons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transfer of excess materials to national stockpile</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, metals, minerals, and materials acquired pursuant to the provisions of this section which, in the judgment of the President, are excess to the needs of programs under this Act [sections 2061 to 2171 of this Appendix], shall be transferred to the National Defense Stockpile established by the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.), when the President deems such action to be in the public interest. Transfers made pursuant to this subsection shall be made without charge against or reimbursement from funds appropriated for the purposes of such Act, except that costs incident to such transfer other than acquisition costs shall be paid or reimbursed from such funds, and the acquisition costs of such metals, minerals, and materials transferred shall be deemed to be net losses incurred by the transferring agency and the notes payable issued to the Secretary of the Treasury representing the amounts thereof shall be canceled. Upon the cancellation of any such notes the aggregate amount of borrowing which may be outstanding at any one time under section 304(b)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2093_1_target" name="2093_1">1</a></sup> of this Act, as amended [section 2094(b) of this Appendix], shall be reduced in an amount equal to the amount of any notes so canceled.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Development of substitutes for strategic and critical materials</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When in his judgment it will aid the national defense, the President may make provision for the development of substitutes for strategic and critical materials, critical components, critical technology items, and other industrial resources.</p>
