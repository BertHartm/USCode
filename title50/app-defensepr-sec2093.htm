<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) from Government-sponsored research and development to commercial applications; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) from commercial research and development to national defense applications.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of certain agricultural commodities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A purchase for resale under this subsection shall not include that part of the supply of an agricultural commodity which is domestically produced, except to the extent that such domestically produced supply may be purchased for resale for industrial use or stockpiling.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Terms of sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No commodity purchased under this subsection shall be sold at less than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the established ceiling price for such commodity, except that minerals, metals, and materials shall not be sold at less than the established ceiling price, or the current domestic market price, whichever is lower; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if no ceiling price has been established, the higher of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the current domestic market price for such commodity; or</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Presidential determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (7), the President may not execute a contract under this subsection unless the President determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the industrial resource, material, or critical technology item is essential to the national defense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) without Presidential action under this section, United States industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the capability for the needed industrial resource, material, or critical technology item in a timely manner.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Notification to Congress of shortfall</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in paragraph (7), the President shall provide written notice to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives of a domestic industrial base shortfall prior to taking action under this subsection to remedy the shortfall. The notice shall include the determinations made by the President under paragraph (5).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Aggregate amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the taking of any action under this subsection to correct a domestic industrial base shortfall would cause the aggregate outstanding amount of all such actions for such shortfall to exceed $50,000,000, the action or actions may be taken only after the 30-day period following the date on which the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives have been notified in writing of the proposed action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) during a period of national emergency declared by the Congress or the President; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) upon a determination by the President, on a nondelegable basis, that action is necessary to avert an industrial resource or critical technology item shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exemption for certain limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the limitations in subsection (a), purchases and commitments to purchase and sales under subsection (a) may be made without regard to the limitations of existing law (other than section 1341 of title 31, United States Code), for such quantities, and on such terms and conditions, including advance payments, and for such periods, but not extending beyond a date that is not more than 10 years from the date on which such purchase, purchase commitment, or sale was initially made, as the President deems necessary, except that purchases or commitments to purchase involving higher than established ceiling prices (or if no such established ceiling prices exist, currently prevailing market prices) or anticipated loss on resale shall not be made, unless it is determined that supply of the materials could not be effectively increased at lower prices or on terms more favorable to the Government, or that such purchases are necessary to assure the availability to the United States of overseas supplies.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:231 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an increase in cost of transportation is temporary in character and threatens to impair maximum production or supply in any area at stable prices of any materials.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Subsidy payments authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon a finding under paragraph (1), the President may make provision for subsidy payments on any such domestically produced material, other than an agricultural commodity, in such amounts and in such manner (including purchases of such material and its resale at a loss), and on such terms and conditions, as the President determines to be necessary to ensure that supplies from such high-cost sources are continued, or that maximum production or supply in such area at stable prices of such materials is maintained, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Incidental authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The procurement power granted to the President by this section shall include the power to transport and store and have processed and refined any materials procured under this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Indemnification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The owner of any plant, factory, or other industrial facility that receives equipment owned by the Federal Government under this section shall agree&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to waive any claim against the United States under section 107 or 113 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9607 and 9613); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to indemnify the United States against any claim described in paragraph (1) made by a third party that arises out of the presence or use of equipment owned by the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Excess metals, minerals, and materials</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, metals, minerals, and materials acquired pursuant to this section which, in the judgment of the President, are excess to the needs of programs under this Act [sections 2061 to 2170, 2171, and 2172 of this Appendix], shall be transferred to the National Defense Stockpile established by the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.), when the President deems such action to be in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Transfers at no charge</h4>
