<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Initial testing and consent</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary may not commence the exercise of the authority under paragraph (2) to waive the applicability of paragraph (1) to any covered persons until 15 days after the date on which the Secretary submits to the appropriate committees of Congress a report setting forth the criteria to be used by the Secretary for determining when a waiver under paragraph (2)(A) is important to the national security interests <!-- PDFPage:517 -->of the United States.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) ensuring that adverse personnel actions not be taken against an individual solely by reason of that individual's physiological reaction to a question in a polygraph examination, unless reasonable efforts are first made to independently determine through alternative means the veracity of that individual's response to that question.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Plan for extension of program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than April 5, 2000, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives a plan on extending the program required by this section.
