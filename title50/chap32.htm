<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Operational verification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Until the Secretary of the Army successfully completes (through the prove-out work to be conducted at Johnston Atoll) operational verification of the technology to be used for the destruction of live chemical agents and munitions under this section, the Secretary may not conduct any activity for equipment prove out and systems test before live chemical agents are introduced at a facility (other than the Johnston Atoll facility) at which the destruction of chemical agent&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1521_2_target" name="1521_2">2</a></sup> and munitions weapons is to take place under this section. The limitation in the preceding sentence shall not apply with respect to the Chemical Agent Munition Disposal System in Tooele, Utah.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon the successful completion of the prove out of the equipment and facility at Johnston Atoll, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives a report certifying that the prove out is completed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Secretary determines at any time that there will be a delay in meeting the deadline of December 31, 1990, scheduled by the Department of Defense for completion of the operational verification at Johnston Atoll referred <!-- PDFPage:197 -->to in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall immediately notify the Committees of that projected delay.</p>
