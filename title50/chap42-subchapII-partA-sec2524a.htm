<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Program required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Energy shall carry out a program, to be known as the Reliable Replacement Warhead program, which will have the following objectives:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To increase the reliability, safety, and security of the United States nuclear weapons stockpile.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To further reduce the likelihood of the resumption of underground nuclear weapons testing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To remain consistent with basic design parameters by including, to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with the objective specified in paragraph (2), components that are well understood or are certifiable without the need to resume underground nuclear weapons testing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To ensure that the nuclear weapons infrastructure can respond to unforeseen problems, to include the ability to produce replacement warheads that are safer to manufacture, more cost-effective to produce, and less costly to maintain than existing warheads.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To achieve reductions in the future size of the nuclear weapons stockpile based on increased reliability of the reliable replacement warheads.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) To use the design, certification, and production expertise resident in the nuclear complex to develop reliable replacement components to fulfill current mission requirements of the existing stockpile.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) To serve as a complement to, and potentially a more cost-effective and reliable long-term replacement for, the current Stockpile Life Extension Programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Energy shall carry out the Reliable Replacement Warhead program in consultation with the Secretary of Defense.</p>
