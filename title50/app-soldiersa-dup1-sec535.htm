<p class="statutory-body">(1) Where any life insurance policy on the life of a person in military service has been assigned prior to such person's period of military service to secure the payment of any obligation of such person, no assignee of such policy (except the insurer in connection with a policy loan) shall, during the period of military service of the insured or within one year thereafter, except upon the consent in writing of the insured made during such period or when the premiums thereon are due and unpaid or upon the death of the insured, exercise any right or option by virtue of such assignment unless upon leave of court granted upon an application made therefor by such assignee. The court may thereupon refuse to grant such leave unless in the opinion of the court the ability of the obligor to comply with the terms of the obligation is not materially affected by reason of his military service. For the purpose of this subsection premiums which are guaranteed under the provisions of article IV of this Act [sections 540 to 548 of this Appendix] shall not be deemed to be due and unpaid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No person shall exercise any right to foreclose or enforce any lien for storage of household goods, furniture, or personal effects of a person in military service during such person's period of military service and for three months thereafter except upon an order previously granted by a court upon application therefor and a return thereto made and approved by the court. In such proceeding the court may, after hearing, in its discretion, on its own motion, and shall, on application to it by such person in military service or some person on his behalf, unless in the opinion of the court the ability of the defendant to pay the storage charges due is not materially affected by reason of his military service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(a) stay the proceedings as provided in this Act [sections 501 to 593 of this Appendix]; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(b) make such other disposition of the case as may be equitable to conserve the interest of all parties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The enactment of the provisions of this subsection shall not be construed in any way as affecting or as limiting the scope of section 302 of this Act [section 532 of this Appendix].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any person who shall knowingly take any action contrary to the provisions of this section, or attempts so to do, shall be fined as provided in title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned for not to exceed one year, or both.</p>
