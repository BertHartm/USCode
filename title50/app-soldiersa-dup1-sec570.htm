<p class="statutory-body">(1) During the pendency of any war in which the United States may be engaged while this Act [sections 501 to 593 of this Appendix] remains in force any homestead entryman shall be entitled to a leave of absence from his entry for the purpose of performing farm labor. The time actually spent in farm labor shall be counted as constructive residence, if within fifteen days after leaving his entry to engage in such labor the entryman files a notice of absence in the land office of the district in which his entry is situated, and if at the expiration of the calendar year the entryman files in that office a written statement under oath and corroborated by two witnesses giving the date or dates when he left his entry, the date or dates of his return, and the place where and person for whom he was engaged in farm labor during such period or periods of absence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this section shall excuse any homestead entryman from making improvements or performing the cultivation upon his entry required by law. The provisions of this section shall apply only to persons whose applications have been allowed or filed before October 17, 1940.</p>
