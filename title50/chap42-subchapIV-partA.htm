<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Accelerated cleanup</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Energy shall accelerate the schedule for environmental restoration and waste management activities and projects for a site at a Department of Energy defense nuclear facility if the Secretary determines that such an accelerated schedule will achieve meaningful, long-term cost savings to the Federal Government and could substantially accelerate the release of land for local reuse.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than May 1, 1996, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on each site for which the Secretary has accelerated the schedule for environmental restoration and waste management activities and projects under subsection (a).
