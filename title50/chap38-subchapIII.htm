<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Disqualification upon remarriage before age 55</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A qualified former spouse shall not be entitled to any benefit under this subsection if, before the commencement of any benefit, the qualified former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Commencement and termination</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The benefits of a qualified former spouse under this subsection commence on the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the day on which the employee upon whose service the benefits are based becomes entitled to the benefits; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the first day of the second month beginning after the date on which the Director receives written notice of the court <!-- PDFPage:359 -->order or spousal agreement, together with such additional information or documentation as the Director may prescribe.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Payments to retired employees</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Calculation of survivor annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any reduction in payments to a retired employee as a result of payments to a qualified former spouse under this subsection shall be disregarded in calculating&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the survivor annuity for any spouse, former spouse (qualified or otherwise), or other survivor under chapter 84 of title 5, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any reduction in the annuity of the retired employee to provide survivor benefits under subsection (d) of this section or under sections&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2154_2_target" name="2154_2">2</a></sup> 8442 or 8445 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Reduction in basic pay upon recall to service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a retired employee whose annuity is reduced under paragraph (1) is recalled to service under section 2152(c) of this title, the basic pay of that annuitant shall be reduced by the same amount as the annuity would have been reduced if it had continued. Amounts equal to the reductions under this subparagraph shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Special rules for disability annuitants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (4), in the case of any qualified former spouse of a disability annuitant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the annuity of such former spouse shall commence on the date on which the employee would qualify, on the basis of the employee's creditable service, for benefits under subchapter II of chapter 84 of title 5 or on the date on which the disability annuity begins, whichever is later; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of the annuity of the qualified former spouse shall be calculated on the basis of the benefits for which the employee would otherwise qualify under subchapter II of chapter 84 of such title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Pro rata share in case of employees transferred to FERS</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(B), in the case of an employee who has elected to become subject to chapter 84 of title 5, the share of such employee's qualified former spouse shall equal the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 50 percent of the employee's annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5 or under subchapter II of this chapter (computed in accordance with section 302(a) of the Federal Employees&rsquo; Retirement System Act of 1986 or section 2157 of this title), multiplied by the proportion that the number of days of marriage during the period of the employee's creditable service before the effective date of the election to transfer bears to the employee's total creditable service before such effective date; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if applicable, 50 percent of the employee's benefits under chapter 84 of title 5 or section 2152(a) of this title (computed in accordance with section 302(a) of the Federal Employees&rsquo; Retirement System Act of 1986 or section 2157 of this title), multiplied by the proportion that the number of days of marriage during the period of the employee's creditable service on and after the effective date of the election to transfer bears to the employee's total creditable service after such effective date.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Treatment of pro rata share under title 26</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of title 26, payments to a qualified former spouse under this subsection shall be treated as income to the qualified former spouse and not to the employee.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to an election under section 8416(a) of title 5, and unless otherwise expressly provided by any spousal agreement or court order governing survivor benefits payable under this subsection to a qualified former spouse, such former spouse is entitled to a share, determined under subparagraph (B), of all survivor benefits that would otherwise be payable under subchapter IV of chapter 84 of title 5 to an eligible surviving spouse of the employee.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The share referred to in subparagraph (A) equals&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a pro rata share of 100 percent, if the qualified former spouse was not married to the employee throughout such creditable service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Survivor benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The survivor benefits payable under this subsection to a qualified former spouse shall include the amount payable under section 8442(b)(1)(A) of title 5 and any supplementary annuity under section 8442(f) of such title that would be payable if such former spouse were a widow or widower entitled to an annuity under such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Any calculation under section 8442(f) of title 5 of the supplementary annuity payable to a widow or widower of an employee referred to in section 2152(a) of this title shall be based on an &ldquo;assumed CIARDS annuity&rdquo; rather than an &ldquo;assumed CSRS annuity&rdquo; as stated in sec<!-- PDFPage:360 -->tion 8442(f) of such title. For the purpose of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;assumed CIARDS annuity&rdquo; means the amount of the survivor annuity to which the widow or widower would be entitled under subchapter II of this chapter based on the service of the deceased annuitant determined under section 8442(f)(5) of such title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Disqualification upon remarriage before age 55</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A qualified former spouse shall not be entitled to any benefit under this subsection if, before commencement of any benefit, the qualified former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Restoration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the survivor annuity payable under this subsection to a surviving qualified former spouse is terminated because of remarriage before becoming age 55, the annuity shall be restored at the same rate commencing on the date such remarriage is dissolved by death, divorce, or annulment, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such former spouse elects to receive this survivor annuity instead of any other survivor benefit to which such former spouse may be entitled under subchapter IV of chapter 84 of title 5, or under another retirement system for Government employees by reason of the remarriage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any lump sum paid on termination of the annuity is returned to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Modification of court order or spousal agreement</h4>
