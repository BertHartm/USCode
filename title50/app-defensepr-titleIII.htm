<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose of loans; guaranteeing agencies; Presidential determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to expedite production and deliveries or services under Government contracts, the President may authorize, subject to such regulations as he may prescribe, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the Department of Commerce, and such other agencies of the United States engaged in procurement for the national defense as he may designate (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;guaranteeing agencies&rdquo;), without regard to provisions of law relating to the making, performance, amendment, or modification of contracts, to guarantee in whole or in part any public or private financing institution (including any Federal Reserve bank), by commitment to purchase, agreement to share losses, or otherwise, against loss of principal or interest on any loan, discount, or advance, or on any commitment in connection therewith, which may be made by such financing institution for the purpose of financing any contractor, subcontractor, or other person in connection with the performance of any contract or other operation deemed by the guaranteeing agency to be necessary to expedite or expand production and deliveries or services under Government contracts for the procurement of industrial resources or critical technology items essential to the national defense, or for the purpose of financing any contractor, subcontractor, or other person in connection with or in contemplation of the termination, in the interest of the United States, of any contract made for the national defense; but no small-business concern (as defined in section 702(16)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2091_1_target" name="2091_1">1</a></sup> [section 2152(16) of this Appendix]) shall be held ineligible for the issuance of such a guaranty by reason of alternative sources of supply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in section 305 [section 2095 of this Appendix] and section 306 [section 2096 of this Appendix], no authority contained in sections 301, 302, or 303 [sections 2091, 2092, or 2093 of this Appendix] may be used in any manner&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the development, production, or distribution of synthetic fuel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for any synthetic fuel project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to assist any person for the purpose of providing goods or services to a synthetic fuel project; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except during periods of national emergency declared by the Congress or the President, a guarantee may be entered into under this section only if the President determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the guaranteed contract or activity is for industrial resources or a critical technology item which is essential to the national defense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) without the guarantee, United States industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the needed industrial resources or critical technology item in a timely manner;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the guarantee is the most cost-effective, expedient, and practical alternative for meeting the need involved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the combination of the United States national defense demand and foreseeable nondefense demand is not less than the output of domestic industrial capability, as determined by the President, including the output to be established through the guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Fiscal agents; accountability; reimbursement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any Federal agency or any Federal Reserve bank, when designated by the President, is authorized to act, on behalf of any guaranteeing agency, as fiscal agent of the United States in the making of such contracts of guarantee and in otherwise carrying out the purposes of this section. All such funds as may be necessary to enable any such fiscal agent to carry out any guarantee made by it on behalf of any guaranteeing agency shall be supplied and disbursed by or under authority from such guaranteeing agency. No such fiscal agent shall have any responsibility or accountability except as agent in taking any action pursuant to or under authority of the provisions of this section. Each such fiscal agent shall be reimbursed by each guaranteeing agency for all expenses and losses incurred by such fiscal agent in acting as agent on behalf of such guaranteeing agency, including among such expenses, notwithstanding any other provision of law, attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses of litigation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Supervision; interest, fees, procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All actions and operations of such fiscal agents under authority of or pursuant to this section shall be subject to the supervision of the President, and to such regulations as he may prescribe; and the President is authorized to prescribe, either specifically or by maximum limits or otherwise, rates of interest, guarantee and commitment fees, and other charges which may be made in connection with loans, discounts, advances, or commitments guaranteed by the guaranteeing agencies through such fiscal agents, and to prescribe regulations governing the forms and procedures (which shall be uniform to the extent practicable) to be utilized in connection with such guarantees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Funds available for guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each guaranteeing agency is authorized to use for the purposes of this section any funds which have heretofore been appropriated or allocated or which hereafter may be appropriated or allocated to it, or which are or may become available to it, for such purposes or for the purpose of meeting the necessities of the national defense.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Identification of industrial resource or critical technology item shortfall; prevention of personal financial insolvency or bankruptcy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (D), a guarantee may be made under this section <!-- PDFPage:226 -->only if the industrial resource or critical technology item shortfall which such guarantee is intended to correct has been identified in the Budget of the United States, or amendments thereto, submitted to the Congress, accompanied by a statement from the President demonstrating that the budget submission is in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a)(3) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any such guarantee may be made only after 60 days have elapsed after such industrial resource or critical technology item shortfall has been identified pursuant to subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the making of any guarantee or guarantees to correct an industrial resource or critical technology item shortfall would cause the aggregate outstanding amount of all guarantees for such industrial resource or critical technology item shortfall to exceed $50,000,000, any such guarantee or guarantees may be made only if specifically authorized by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The requirements of subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) may be waived&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) during periods of national emergency declared by the Congress or the President; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) upon a determination by the President, on a nondelegable basis, that a specific guarantee is necessary to avert an industrial resource or critical technology item shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The authority conferred by this section shall not be used primarily to prevent the financial insolvency or bankruptcy of any person, unless</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the President certifies that the insolvency or bankruptcy would have a direct and substantially adverse effect upon defense production; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a copy of such certification, together with a detailed justification thereof, is transmitted to the Congress and to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives at least ten days prior to the exercise of that authority for such use.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms and conditions; Presidential determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such loans may be made without regard to the limitations of existing law and on such terms and conditions as the President deems necessary, except that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the loan is for the expansion of capacity, the development of a technological process, or the production of materials essential to the national defense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) without the loan, United States industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the needed capacity, technological processes, or materials in a timely manner;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the loan is the most cost-effective, expedient, and practical alternative method for meeting the need; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the combination of the United States national defense demand and foreseeable nondefense demand is not less than the output of domestic industrial capability, as determined by the President, including the output to be established through the loan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any such loan may be made only after 60 days have elapsed after such industrial resource shortfall has been identified pursuant to paragraph (1).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Presidential provisions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To assist in carrying out the objectives of this Act [sections 2061 to 2171 of this Appendix], the President may make provision&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for purchases of or commitments to purchase an industrial resource or a critical technology item, for Government use or resale; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for the encouragement of exploration, development, and mining of critical and strategic materials, and other materials.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of certain agricultural commodities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Purchases for resale under this subsection shall not include that part of the supply of an agricultural commodity which is domestically produced, except to the extent that such domestically produced supply may be purchased for resale for industrial use or stockpiling.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Terms of sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No commodity purchased under this subsection shall be sold at less than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the established ceiling price for such commodity, except that minerals, metals, and materials shall not be sold at less than the established ceiling price, or the current domestic market price, whichever is lower; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if no ceiling price has been established, the higher of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the current domestic market price for such commodity; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the minimum sale price established for agricultural commodities owned or controlled by the Commodity Credit Corporation, as provided in section 407 of the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1427].</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Delivery dates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No purchase or commitment to purchase any imported agricultural commodity shall specify a delivery date which is more than 1 year after the expiration of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Presidential determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (7), the President may not execute a contract under this subsection unless the President determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the industrial resource or critical technology item is essential to the national defense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) without Presidential action under the authority provided for in this section, United States industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the capability for the needed industrial resource or critical technology item in a timely manner;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) purchases, purchase commitments, or other action pursuant to this section are the most cost-effective, expedient, and practical alternative method for meeting the need; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the combination of the United States national defense demand and foreseeable nondefense demand for the industrial resource or critical technology item is not less than the output of domestic industrial capability, as determined by the President, including the output to be established through the purchase, purchase commitment, or other action.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Identification of shortfall</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in paragraph (7), the President shall take no action under this <!-- PDFPage:229 -->section unless the industrial resource shortfall which such action is intended to correct has been identified in the Budget of the United States, or amendments thereto, submitted to the Congress and accompanied by a statement from the President demonstrating that the budget submission is in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (5).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Timing of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any such action may be taken only after 60 days have elapsed after such industrial resource shortfall has been identified pursuant to subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the taking of any action or actions under this section to correct an industrial resource shortfall would cause the aggregate outstanding amount of all such actions for such industrial resource shortfall to exceed $50,000,000, any such action or actions may be taken only if specifically authorized by law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirements of paragraphs (1) through (6) may be waived&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) during periods of national emergency declared by the Congress or the President; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) upon a determination by the President, on a nondelegable basis, that a specific guarantee is necessary to avert an industrial resource or critical technology item shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms and conditions of purchase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the limitations in subsection (a) of this section, purchases and commitments to purchase and sales under such subsection may be made without regard to the limitations of existing law, for such quantities, and on such terms and conditions, including advance payments, and for such periods, but not extending beyond a date that is not more than 10 years from the date such purchase, purchase commitment, or sale was initially made, as the President deems necessary, except that purchases or commitments to purchase involving higher than established ceiling prices (or if there be no established ceiling prices, currently prevailing market prices) or anticipated loss on resale shall not be made unless it is determined that supply of the materials could not be effectively increased at lower prices or on terms more favorable to the Government or that such purchases are necessary to assure the availability to the United States of overseas supplies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Subsidy payments on domestically produced materials; exclusion of agricultural products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the President finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that under generally fair and equitable ceiling prices for any raw or nonprocessed material, there will result a decrease in supplies from high-costs sources of such material, and that the continuation of such supplies is necessary to carry out the objectives of the Act [sections 2061 to 2171 of this Appendix]; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that an increase in cost of transportation is temporary in character and threatens to impair maximum production or supply in any area at stable prices of any materials;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">he may make provision for subsidy payments on any such domestically produced material other than an agricultural commodity in such amounts and in such manner (including purchases of such material and its resale at a loss without regard to the limitations of existing law), and on such terms and conditions, as he determines to be necessary to insure that supplies from such high-cost sources are continued, or that maximum production or supply in such area at stable prices of such materials is maintained, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Transportation, storage, and processing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The procurement power granted to the President by this section shall include the power to transport and store and have processed and refined, any materials procured under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Installation of equipment in industrial facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When in his judgment it will aid the national defense, the President is authorized to install additional equipment, facilities, processes or improvements to plants, factories, and other industrial facilities owned by the United States Government, and to install government-owned equipment in plants, factories, and other industrial facilities owned by private persons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transfer of excess materials to national stockpile</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, metals, minerals, and materials acquired pursuant to the provisions of this section which, in the judgment of the President, are excess to the needs of programs under this Act [sections 2061 to 2171 of this Appendix], shall be transferred to the National Defense Stockpile established by the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.), when the President deems such action to be in the public interest. Transfers made pursuant to this subsection shall be made without charge against or reimbursement from funds appropriated for the purposes of such Act, except that costs incident to such transfer other than acquisition costs shall be paid or reimbursed from such funds, and the acquisition costs of such metals, minerals, and materials transferred shall be deemed to be net losses incurred by the transferring agency and the notes payable issued to the Secretary of the Treasury representing the amounts thereof shall be canceled. Upon the cancellation of any such notes the aggregate amount of borrowing which may be outstanding at any one time under section 304(b)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2093_1_target" name="2093_1">1</a></sup> of this Act, as amended [section 2094(b) of this Appendix], shall be reduced in an amount equal to the amount of any notes so canceled.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Development of substitutes for strategic and critical materials</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When in his judgment it will aid the national defense, the President may make provision for the development of substitutes for strategic and critical materials, critical components, critical technology items, and other industrial resources.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) A fair business environment is necessary to advance international trade, economic stability, and development worldwide, is beneficial for American workers and businesses, and is in the United States national interest.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In some cases, mandated offset requirements can cause economic distortions in international defense trade and undermine fairness and competitiveness, and may cause particular harm to small- and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The use of offsets may lead to increasing dependence on foreign suppliers for the production of United States weapons systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The offset demands required by some purchasing countries, including some close allies of the United States, equal or exceed the value of the base contract they are intended to offset, mitigating much of the potential economic benefit of the exports.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Offset demands often unduly distort the prices of defense contracts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In some cases, United States contractors are required to provide indirect offsets which can negatively impact nondefense industrial sectors.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Unilateral efforts by the United States to prohibit offsets may be impractical in the current era of globalization and would severely hinder the competitiveness of the United States defense industry in the global market.</p>
