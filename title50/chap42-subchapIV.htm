<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Accelerated cleanup</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Energy shall accelerate the schedule for environmental restoration and waste management activities and projects for a site at a Department of Energy defense nuclear facility if the Secretary determines that such an accelerated schedule will achieve meaningful, long-term cost savings to the Federal Government and could substantially accelerate the release of land for local reuse.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Energy shall select and carry out closure-acceleration projects in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of a closure-acceleration project shall be, within a fixed period of time, to clean up or decommission a Department of Energy defense nuclear facility or portion thereof and to make the facility safe by stabilizing, consolidating, treating, or removing nuclear materials from the facility in order to reduce significantly or eliminate future costs at the facility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligible projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of Energy may establish a closure-acceleration project as eligible for selection under subsection (e) by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) developing a plan for the project that meets the criteria under paragraph (2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) determining that the project will achieve significant long-term cost savings to the Federal Government from the baseline cost estimate made by the Department of Energy for the project.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A plan for a closure-acceleration project under this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) define a clear, delineated scope of work for completion of the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) demonstrate that, with respect to the site of the proposed project, there is a regulatory agreement between the Department of Energy and other appropriate authorities for the implementation of environmental remediation requirements that would allow for successful completion of the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) demonstrate, to the maximum extent possible, the support of State and local elected officials and the public for the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) contain performance-based provisions to be included in the contract for the project, including&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Funds appropriated for purposes of carrying out projects under this section shall remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a closure-acceleration project is being carried out at a defense nuclear facility with funds appropriated for such projects, the Secretary of Energy may not reduce the funds otherwise allocated to that defense nuclear facility for environmental restoration and waste management by reason of the funds being used for the project at that facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Funds appropriated for purposes of carrying out projects under this section may not be used for an item for which Congress has specifically denied funds or for a new program or project that has not been authorized by Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Annual report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Energy shall submit each year to Congress a report on the status of each <!-- PDFPage:505 -->closure-acceleration project being carried out under this section. The report shall include, for each such project, the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Not later than February 3, 1991, the Secretary of Energy shall identify which single-shelled or double-shelled high-level nuclear waste tanks at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, Richland, Washington, may have a serious potential for release of high-level waste due to uncontrolled increases in temperature or pressure. After completing such identification, the Secretary shall determine whether continuous monitoring is being carried out to detect a release or excessive temperature or pressure at each tank so identified. If such monitoring is not being carried out, as soon as practicable the Secretary shall install such monitoring, but only if a type of monitoring that does not itself increase the danger of a release can be installed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Action plans</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than May 5, 1991, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on actions taken to promote tank safety, including actions taken pursuant to this section, and the Secretary's timetable for resolving outstanding issues on how to handle the waste in such tanks.</p>
