<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To expedite production and deliveries or services to aid in carrying out Government contracts for the procurement of industrial resources or a critical technology item for the national defense, the President may make provision for loans (including participations in, or guarantees of, loan) to private business enterprises (including research corporations not organized for profit) for the expansion of capacity, the development of technological processes, or the production of essential materials, including the exploration, development, and mining of strategic and critical metals and minerals, and manufacture of newsprint.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms and conditions; Presidential determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such loans may be made without regard to the limitations of existing law and on such terms and conditions as the President deems necessary, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) financial assistance may be extended only to the extent that it is not otherwise available on reasonable terms; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) except during periods of national emergency declared by the Congress or the President, no such loan may be made unless the President determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the loan is for the expansion of capacity, the development of a technological process, or the production of materials essential to the national defense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) without the loan, United States industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the needed capacity, technological processes, or materials in a timely manner;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the loan is the most cost-effective, expedient, and practical alternative method for meeting the need; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the combination of the United States national defense demand and foreseeable nondefense demand is not less than the output of domestic industrial capability, as determined by the President, including the output to be established through the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Identification of industrial resource shortfall</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (4), no loans may be made under this section, unless <!-- PDFPage:231 -->the industrial resource shortfall which such loan is intended to correct has been identified in the Budget of the United States, or amendments thereto, submitted to the Congress, accompanied by a statement from the President demonstrating that the budget submission is in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any such loan may be made only after 60 days have elapsed after such industrial resource shortfall has been identified pursuant to paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the making of any loan or loans to correct an industrial resource shortfall would cause the aggregate outstanding amount of all loans for such industrial resource shortfall to exceed $50,000,000, any such loan or loans may be made only if specifically authorized by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) may be waived&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) during periods of national emergency declared by the Congress or the President; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) upon a determination by the President, on a nondelegable basis, that a specific guarantee is necessary to avert an industrial resource or critical technology shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability.</p>
