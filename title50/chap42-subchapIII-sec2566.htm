<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Plan for construction and operation of MOX facility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than February 1, 2003, the Secretary of Energy shall submit to Congress a plan for the construction and operation of the MOX facility at the Savannah River Site, Aiken, South Carolina.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a schedule for construction and operations so as to achieve, as of January 1, 2012, and thereafter, the MOX production objective, and to produce 1 metric ton of mixed-oxide fuel by December 31, 2012; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a schedule of operations of the MOX facility designed so that 34 metric tons of defense plutonium and defense plutonium materials at the Savannah River Site will be processed into mixed-oxide fuel by January 1, 2019.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Not later than February 15 each year, beginning in 2004 and continuing for as long as the MOX facility is in use, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the implementation of the plan required by paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Each report under subparagraph (A) for years before 2010 shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) an assessment of compliance with the schedules included with the plan under paragraph (2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a certification by the Secretary whether or not the MOX production objective can be met by January 2012.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) Upon making a determination under paragraph (4) or (5), the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the options for removing from the State of South Carolina an amount of defense plutonium or defense plutonium materials equal to the amount of defense plutonium or defense plutonium materials transferred to the State of South Carolina after April 15, 2002.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Each report under subparagraph (A) shall include an analysis of each option set forth in the report, including the cost and schedule for implementation of such option, and any requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) relating to consideration or selection of such option.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Upon submittal of a report under paragraph (A), the Secretary shall commence any analysis that may be required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 in order to select among the options set forth in the report.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contingent requirement for removal of plutonium and materials from Savannah River Site</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the MOX production objective is not achieved as of January 1, 2012, the Secretary shall, consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.] and other applicable laws, remove from the State of South Carolina, for storage or disposal elsewhere&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) not later than January 1, 2014, not less than 1 metric ton of defense plutonium or defense plutonium materials; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) not later than January 1, 2020, an amount of defense plutonium or defense plutonium materials equal to the amount of defense plutonium or defense plutonium materials transferred to the Savannah River Site between April 15, 2002 and January 1, 2020, but not processed by the MOX facility.</p>
