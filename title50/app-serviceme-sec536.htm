<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Order refused because of material affect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A court which receives an application for an order required under subsection (a) may refuse to grant such order if the court determines the ability of the servicemember to comply with the terms of the obligation is materially affected by military service.</p>
