<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Annuity of participant</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Computation of annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The annuity of a participant is the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the participant's high-3 average pay (as defined in paragraph (4)); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of years, not exceeding 35, of service credit (determined in accordance with sections 2081 and 2082 of this title) multiplied by 2 percent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Credit for unused sick leave</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The total service of a participant who retires on an immediate annuity (except under section 2051 of this title) or who dies leaving a survivor or survivors entitled to an annuity shall include (without regard to the 35-year limitation prescribed in paragraph (1)) the days of unused sick leave to the credit of the participant. Days of unused sick leave may not be counted in determining average basic pay or eligibility for an annuity under this subchapter. A deposit shall not be required for days of unused sick leave credited under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Crediting of part-time service</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a participant whose service includes service on a part-time basis performed after April 6, 1986, the participant's annuity shall be the sum of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (B) and (C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Computation of pre-April 7, 1986, annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The portion of an annuity referred to in subparagraph (A) with respect to service before April 7, 1986, shall be the amount computed under paragraph (1) using the participant's length of service before that date (increased by the unused sick leave to the credit of the participant at the time of retirement) and the participant's high-3 average pay.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Computation of post-April 6, 1986, annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The portion of an annuity referred to in subparagraph (A) with respect to service after April 6, 1986, shall be the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount computed under paragraph (1), using the participant's length of service after that date and the participant's high-3 average pay, as determined by using the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the ratio which the participant's actual service after April 6, 1986 (as determined by prorating the participant's total service after that date to reflect the service that was performed on a part-time basis) bears to the total service after that date that would be creditable for the participant if all the service had been performed on a full-time basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Treatment of employment on temporary or intermittent basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Employment on a temporary or intermittent basis shall not be considered to be service on a part-time basis for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) High-3 average pay defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, a participant's high-3 average pay is the amount of the participant's average basic pay for the highest 3 consecutive years of the participant's service for which full contributions have been made to the fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Computation of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the aggregate period of service upon which an annuity is to be based, any fractional part of a month shall not be counted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Spouse or former spouse survivor annuity</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Reduction in participant's annuity to provide spouse or former spouse survivor annuity</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except to the extent provided otherwise under a written election under subparagraph (B) or (C), if at the time of retirement a participant or former participant is married (or has a former spouse who has not remarried before attaining age 55), the participant shall receive a reduced annuity and provide a survivor annuity for the participant's spouse under this subsection or former spouse under section 2032(b) of this title, or a combination of such annuities, as the case may be.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:311 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Joint election for waiver or reduction of spouse survivor annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A married participant or former participant and the participant's spouse may jointly elect in writing at the time of retirement to waive a survivor annuity for that spouse under this section or to reduce such survivor annuity under this section by designating a portion of the annuity of the participant as the base for the survivor annuity. If the marriage is dissolved following an election for such a reduced annuity and the spouse qualifies as a former spouse, the base used in calculating any annuity of the former spouse under section 2032(b) of this title may not exceed the portion of the participant's annuity designated under this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Joint election of participant and former spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a participant or former participant has a former spouse, such participant and the participant's former spouse may jointly elect by spousal agreement under section 2094(b) of this title to waive, reduce, or increase a survivor annuity under section 2032(b) of this title for that former spouse. Any such election must be made (i) before the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date on which the divorce or annulment involving that former spouse becomes final, or (ii) at the time of retirement of the participant, whichever is later.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Unilateral elections in absence of spouse or former spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Director may prescribe regulations under which a participant or former participant may make an election under subparagraph (B) or (C) without the participant's spouse or former spouse if the participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Director that the participant does not know, and has taken all reasonable steps to determine, the whereabouts of the spouse or former spouse.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of reduction in participant's annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The annuity of a participant or former participant providing a survivor annuity under this section (or section 2032(b) of this title), excluding any portion of the annuity not designated or committed as a base for any survivor annuity, shall be reduced by 21/2 percent of the first $3,600 plus 10 percent of any amount over $3,600. The reduction under this paragraph shall be calculated before any reduction under section 2032(a)(5) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Amount of surviving spouse annuity</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a retired participant receiving a reduced annuity under this subsection dies and is survived by a spouse, a survivor annuity shall be paid to the surviving spouse. The amount of the annuity shall be equal to 55 percent of (i) the full amount of the participant's annuity computed under subsection (a) of this section, or (ii) any lesser amount elected as the base for the survivor annuity under paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the amount of the annuity calculated under subparagraph (A) for a surviving spouse in any case in which there is also a surviving former spouse of the retired participant who qualifies for an annuity under section 2032(b) of this title may not exceed 55 percent of the portion (if any) of the base for survivor annuities which remains available under section 2032(b)(4)(B) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Effective date and termination of annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An annuity payable from the fund to a surviving spouse under this paragraph shall commence on the day after the retired participant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before the surviving spouse's death or remarriage before attaining age 55. If such survivor annuity is terminated because of remarriage, it shall be restored at the same rate commencing on the date such remarriage is dissolved by death, annulment, or divorce if any lump sum paid upon termination of the annuity is returned to the fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) 18-month open period after retirement to provide spouse coverage</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Survivor annuity elections</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Election when spouse coverage waived at time of retirement</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) elects at that time (in accordance with subsection (b) of this section) to waive a survivor annuity for the spouse,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of the retirement of the participant, elect to have a reduction under subsection (b) of this section made in the annuity of the participant (or in such portion thereof as the participant may designate) in order to provide a survivor annuity for the participant's spouse.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Election when reduced spouse annuity elected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A participant or former participant who retires after March 31, 1992, and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) who, at the time of retirement, is married, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) who, at that time designates (in accordance with subsection (b) of this section) that a portion of the annuity of such participant is to be used as the base for a survivor annuity,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of the retirement of such participant, elect to have a greater portion of the annuity of such participant so used.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Deposit required</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Requirement</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the difference (for the period between the date on which the annuity of the participant or former participant commences and the date of the election) between the amount paid to such participant or former participant under this subchapter and the amount which would have been paid if such election had been made at the time the participant or former participant applied for the annuity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the costs associated with providing for the later election.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Interest</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Voiding of previous elections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An election by a participant or former participant under this subsection voids prospectively any election previously made in the case of such participant under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Reductions in annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An annuity that is reduced in connection with an election under this subsection shall be reduced by the same percentage reductions as were in effect at the time of the retirement of the participant or former participant whose annuity is so reduced.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Rights and obligations resulting from reduced annuity election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Rights and obligations resulting from the election of a reduced annuity under this subsection shall be the same as the rights and obligations that would have resulted had the participant involved elected such annuity at the time of retirement.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) When annuity previously not (or not fully) reduced</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the retired participant's annuity was not reduced (or was not fully reduced) to provide a survivor annuity for the participant's spouse or former spouse as of the time of retirement, the retired participant may make an election under the first sentence of subparagraph (A) upon remarriage to a spouse other than the spouse at the time of retirement. For any remarriage that occurred before August 14, 1991, the retired participant may make such an election within 2 years after such date.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Deposit required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) The retired participant shall, within one year after the date of the remarriage (or by August 14, 1993 for any remarriage <!-- PDFPage:314 -->that occurred before August 14, 1991), deposit in the fund an amount determined by the Director, as nearly as may be administratively feasible, to reflect the amount by which the retired participant's annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date the annuity commenced, plus interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) The annual rate of interest for each year during which the retired participant's annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date the annuity commenced shall be 6 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) If the retired participant does not make the deposit, the Director shall collect such amount by offset against the participant's annuity, up to a maximum of 25 percent of the net annuity otherwise payable to the retired participant, and the retired participant is deemed to consent to such offset.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) The deposit required by this subparagraph may be made by the surviving spouse of the retired participant.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Effects of election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An election under this paragraph and the reduction in the participant's annuity shall be effective on the first day of the month beginning 9 months after the date of remarriage.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A surviving spouse whose survivor annuity was terminated because of remarriage before attaining age 55 shall not be entitled under subsection (b)(3)(C) of this section to the restoration of that survivor annuity payable from the fund unless the surviving spouse elects to receive it instead of any other survivor annuity to which the surviving spouse may be entitled under the system or any other retirement system for Government employees by reason of the remarriage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Former spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A surviving former spouse of a participant or retired participant shall not become entitled under section 2032(b) or 2034 of this title to a survivor annuity or to the restoration of a survivor annuity payable from the fund unless the surviving former spouse elects to receive it instead of any other survivor annuity to which the surviving former spouse may be entitled under this or any other retirement system for Government employees on the basis of a marriage to someone other than the participant.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Surviving spouse of post-retirement marriage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A surviving spouse who married a participant after the participant's retirement shall be entitled to a survivor annuity payable from the fund only upon electing that annuity instead of any other survivor annuity to which the surviving spouse may be entitled under this or any other retirement system for Government employees on the basis of a marriage to someone other than the retired participant.</p>

Such supplemental survivor annuity shall be equal to 55 percent of the supplemental annuity of the annuitant.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall prescribe regulations to provide for the application of paragraph (1) of this subsection and of subsection (b) of section 2111 of this title in any case in which an annuitant has a former spouse who was married to the recalled annuitant at any time during the period of recall service and who qualifies for an annuity under section 2032(b) of this title.</p>
