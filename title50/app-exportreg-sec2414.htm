<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Issuance of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President and the Secretary may issue such regulations as are necessary to carry out <!-- PDFPage:347 -->the provisions of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix]. Any such regulations issued to carry out the provisions of section 5(a), 6(a), 7(a), or 8(b) [section 2404(a), 2405(a), 2406(a), or 2407(b) of this Appendix] may apply to the financing, transporting, or other servicing of exports and the participation therein by any person.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amendments to regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary proposes to amend regulations issued under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix], the Secretary shall report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives on the intent and rationale of such amendments.
