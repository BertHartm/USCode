<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Reassessment of major system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Director of National Intelligence determines under section 415a&ndash;7(d) of this title that the total acquisition cost of a major system has increased by a percentage equal to or greater than the critical cost growth threshold for the major system, the Director shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) determine the root cause or causes of the critical cost growth, in accordance with applicable statutory requirements, policies, procedures, and guidance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) carry out an assessment of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the projected cost of completing the major system if current requirements are not modified;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the projected cost of completing the major system based on reasonable modification of such requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the rough order of magnitude of the costs of any reasonable alternative system or capability; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the need to reduce funding for other systems due to the growth in cost of the major system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Presumption of termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After conducting the reassessment required by subsection (a) with respect to a major system, the Director shall terminate the major system unless the Director submits to Congress a Major System Congressional Report containing a certification in accordance with paragraph (2) and the information described in paragraph (3). The Director shall submit such Major System Congressional Report and certification not later than 90 days after the date the Director receives the relevant major system cost report under subsection (b) or (c) of section 415a&ndash;7 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A certification described by this paragraph with respect to a major system is a written certification that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the continuation of the major system is essential to the national security;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) there are no alternatives to the major system that will provide acceptable capability <!-- PDFPage:194 -->to meet the intelligence requirement at less cost;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the new estimates of the total acquisition cost have been determined by the Director to be reasonable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the major system is a higher priority than other systems whose funding must be reduced to accommodate the growth in cost of the major system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the management structure for the major system is adequate to manage and control the total acquisition cost.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A Major System Congressional Report accompanying a written certification under paragraph (2) shall include, in addition to the requirements of section 415a&ndash;7(e) of this title, the root cause analysis and assessment carried out pursuant to subsection (a), the basis for each determination made in accordance with subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (2), and a description of all funding changes made as a result of the growth in the cost of the major system, including reductions made in funding for other systems to accommodate such cost growth, together with supporting documentation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Actions if major system not terminated</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Director elects not to terminate a major system pursuant to subsection (b), the Director shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) restructure the major system in a manner that addresses the root cause or causes of the critical cost growth, as identified pursuant to subsection (a), and ensures that the system has an appropriate management structure as set forth in the certification submitted pursuant to subsection (b)(2)(E);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) rescind the most recent Milestone approval for the major system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) require a new Milestone approval for the major system before taking any action to enter a new contract, exercise an option under an existing contract, or otherwise extend the scope of an existing contract under the system, except to the extent determined necessary by the Milestone Decision Authority, on a nondelegable basis, to ensure that the system may be restructured as intended by the Director without unnecessarily wasting resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) establish a revised current Baseline Estimate for the major system based upon an updated cost estimate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) conduct regular reviews of the major system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Actions if major system terminated</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a major system is terminated pursuant to subsection (b), the Director shall submit to Congress a written report setting forth&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an explanation of the reasons for terminating the major system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the alternatives considered to address any problems in the major system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the course the Director plans to pursue to meet any intelligence requirements otherwise intended to be met by the major system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Form of report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any report or certification required to be submitted under this section may be submitted in a classified form.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Director may waive the requirements of subsections (d)(2), (e), and (g) of section 415a&ndash;7 of this title and subsections (a)(2), (b), (c), and (d) of this section with respect to a major system if the Director determines that at least 90 percent of the amount of the current Baseline Estimate for the major system has been expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If the Director grants a waiver under paragraph (1) with respect to a major system, the Director shall submit to the congressional intelligence committees written notice of the waiver that includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the information described in section 415a&ndash;7(f) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if the current total acquisition cost of the major system has increased by a percentage equal to or greater than the critical cost growth threshold&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) a determination of the root cause or causes of the critical cost growth, as described in subsection (a)(1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) a certification that includes the elements described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (E) of subsection (b)(2).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Director shall submit the written notice required by subparagraph (A) not later than 90 days after the date that the Director receives a major system cost report under subsection (b) or (c) of section 415a&ndash;7 of this title that indicates that the total acquisition cost for the major system has increased by a percentage equal to or greater than the significant cost growth threshold or critical cost growth threshold.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section, the terms &ldquo;cost estimate&rdquo;, &ldquo;critical cost growth threshold&rdquo;, &ldquo;current Baseline Estimate&rdquo;, &ldquo;major system&rdquo;, and &ldquo;total acquisition cost&rdquo; have the meaning given those terms in section 415a&ndash;7(a) of this title.</p>
