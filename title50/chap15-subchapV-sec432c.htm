<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In any case in which information specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign relations which is filed with, or produced for, the court by the Defense Intelligence Agency, such information shall be examined ex parte, in camera by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The court shall determine, to the fullest extent practicable, issues of fact based on sworn written submissions of the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) When a complainant alleges that requested records were improperly withheld because of improper placement solely in exempted operational files, the complainant shall support such allegation with a sworn written submission based upon personal knowledge or otherwise admissible evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D)(i) When a complainant alleges that requested records were improperly withheld because of improper exemption of operational files, the Defense Intelligence Agency shall meet its burden under section 552(a)(4)(B) of title 5 by demonstrating to the court by sworn written submission that exempted operational files likely to contain responsible records currently perform the functions set forth in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The court may not order the Defense Intelligence Agency to review the content of any exempted operational file or files in order to make the demonstration required under clause (i), unless the complainant disputes the Defense Intelligence Agency's showing with a sworn written submission based on personal knowledge or otherwise admissible evidence.</p>

The Director of National Intelligence must approve any determinations to remove such exemptions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The review required by paragraph (1) shall include consideration of the historical value or other public interest in the subject matter of the particular category of files or portions thereof and the potential for declassifying a significant part of the information contained therein.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A complainant that alleges that the Defense Intelligence Agency has improperly withheld records because of failure to comply with this subsection may seek judicial review in the district court of the United States of the district in which any of the parties reside, or in the District of Columbia.
