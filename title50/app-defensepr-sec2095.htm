<p class="statutory-body">(C) Each contract entered into under this section for the purchase of or commitment to purchase synthetic fuel shall provide that all parties to such contract agree to review and to possibly renegotiate such contract within 10 years after the date of the initial production at the synthetic fuel project involved. At the time of such review, the President shall determine the need for continued financial assistance pursuant to such contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In any case in which the President, under the provisions of this section, accepts delivery of any synthetic fuel, such synthetic fuel may be used by an appropriate Federal agency. Such Federal agency shall pay for such synthetic fuel the prevailing market price for the product which such synthetic fuel is replacing, as determined by the Secretary of Energy, from sums appropriated to such Federal agency for the purchase of fuel, and the President shall pay, from sums appropriated for such purpose pursuant to the authorizations contained in sections 711(a)(2) and 711(a)(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2095_2_target" name="2095_2">2</a></sup> [section 2161(a)(2) and 2161(a)(3) of this Appendix], an amount equal to the amount by which the contract price for such synthetic fuel as specified in the contract involved exceeds such prevailing market price.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which synthetic fuel is acquired by the Government under this section, such synthetic fuel is no longer needed to meet national defense needs, and such synthetic fuel is not accepted by a Federal agency pursuant to subsection (d)(5), the President shall offer such synthetic fuel to the Secretary of Energy for purposes of meeting the storage requirements of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any synthetic fuel which is acquired by the Government under this section and which is not used by the Government or accepted by the Secretary of Energy pursuant to paragraph (2) shall be sold in accordance with applicable Federal law.</p>

Guaranteeing agencies shall not extend guarantees and the President shall not make loans for the construction, repair or alteration of any synthetic fuel project unless a certification is provided to the agency or the President, as the case may be, prior to the commencement of construction or at the time of filing an application for a loan or guarantee, if construction has already commenced, that these labor standards will be maintained at the synthetic fuel project. With respect to the labor standards specified in this subsection, the Secretary of Labor shall have the authority and functions set forth in Reorganization Plan Numbered 14 of 1950.</p>
