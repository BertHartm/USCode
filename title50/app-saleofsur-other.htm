No charters shall be made by the Secretary of Transportation under authority of this subsection until the Maritime Administration shall have given due notice to all interested parties and shall have afforded such parties an opportunity for a public hearing on such charters and shall have certified its findings to the Secretary of Transportation.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A charter existing on June 30, 1950, with respect to a war-built dry-cargo vessel may be extended to October 31, 1950, if application is made within ten days after the enactment hereof [June 30, 1950] for the charter of such vessel under this subsection and if the Secretary of Transportation deems such extension is justified in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection: <em>Provided, however</em>, That a new voyage under such extended charter shall not be begun after October 31, 1950, unless it has been determined prior to such date, in accordance with the procedure set forth in this subsection, that the continued use of the vessel in the service is required.
