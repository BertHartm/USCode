<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Annuity of participant</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Computation of annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The annuity of a participant is the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the participant's high-3 average pay (as defined in paragraph (4)); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of years, not exceeding 35, of service credit (determined in accordance with sections 2081 and 2082 of this title) multiplied by 2 percent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Credit for unused sick leave</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The total service of a participant who retires on an immediate annuity (except under section 2051 of this title) or who dies leaving a survivor or survivors entitled to an annuity shall include (without regard to the 35-year limitation prescribed in paragraph (1)) the days of unused sick leave to the credit of the participant. Days of unused sick leave may not be counted in determining average basic pay or eligibility for an annuity under this subchapter. A deposit shall not be required for days of unused sick leave credited under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Crediting of part-time service</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a participant whose service includes service on a part-time basis performed after April 6, 1986, the participant's annuity shall be the sum of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (B) and (C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Computation of pre-April 7, 1986, annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The portion of an annuity referred to in subparagraph (A) with respect to service before April 7, 1986, shall be the amount computed under paragraph (1) using the participant's length of service before that date (increased by the unused sick leave to the credit of the participant at the time of retirement) and the participant's high-3 average pay.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Computation of post-April 6, 1986, annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The portion of an annuity referred to in subparagraph (A) with respect to service after April 6, 1986, shall be the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount computed under paragraph (1), using the participant's length of service after that date and the participant's high-3 average pay, as determined by using the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the ratio which the participant's actual service after April 6, 1986 (as determined by prorating the participant's total service after that date to reflect the service that was performed on a part-time basis) bears to the total service after that date that would be creditable for the participant if all the service had been performed on a full-time basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Treatment of employment on temporary or intermittent basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Employment on a temporary or intermittent basis shall not be considered to be service on a part-time basis for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) High-3 average pay defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, a participant's high-3 average pay is the amount of the participant's average basic pay for the highest 3 consecutive years of the participant's service for which full contributions have been made to the fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Computation of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the aggregate period of service upon which an annuity is to be based, any fractional part of a month shall not be counted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Spouse or former spouse survivor annuity</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Reduction in participant's annuity to provide spouse or former spouse survivor annuity</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except to the extent provided otherwise under a written election under subparagraph (B) or (C), if at the time of retirement a participant or former participant is married (or has a former spouse who has not remarried before attaining age 55), the participant shall receive a reduced annuity and provide a survivor annuity for the participant's spouse under this subsection or former spouse under section 2032(b) of this title, or a combination of such annuities, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Joint election for waiver or reduction of spouse survivor annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A married participant or former participant and the participant's spouse may jointly elect in writing at the time of retirement to waive a survivor annuity for that spouse under this section or to reduce such survivor annuity under this section by designating a portion of the annuity of the participant as the base for the survivor annuity. If the marriage is dissolved following an election for such a reduced annuity and the spouse qualifies as a former spouse, the base used in calculating any annuity of the former spouse under section 2032(b) of this title may not exceed the portion of the participant's annuity designated under this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Joint election of participant and former spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a participant or former participant has a former spouse, such participant and the par<!-- PDFPage:240 -->ticipant's former spouse may jointly elect by spousal agreement under section 2094(b) of this title to waive, reduce, or increase a survivor annuity under section 2032(b) of this title for that former spouse. Any such election must be made (i) before the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date on which the divorce or annulment involving that former spouse becomes final, or (ii) at the time of retirement of the participant, whichever is later.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Unilateral elections in absence of spouse or former spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Director may prescribe regulations under which a participant or former participant may make an election under subparagraph (B) or (C) without the participant's spouse or former spouse if the participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Director that the participant does not know, and has taken all reasonable steps to determine, the whereabouts of the spouse or former spouse.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of reduction in participant's annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The annuity of a participant or former participant providing a survivor annuity under this section (or section 2032(b) of this title), excluding any portion of the annuity not designated or committed as a base for any survivor annuity, shall be reduced by 21/2 percent of the first $3,600 plus 10 percent of any amount over $3,600. The reduction under this paragraph shall be calculated before any reduction under section 2032(a)(5) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Amount of surviving spouse annuity</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a retired participant receiving a reduced annuity under this subsection dies and is survived by a spouse, a survivor annuity shall be paid to the surviving spouse. The amount of the annuity shall be equal to 55 percent of (i) the full amount of the participant's annuity computed under subsection (a) of this section, or (ii) any lesser amount elected as the base for the survivor annuity under paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the amount of the annuity calculated under subparagraph (A) for a surviving spouse in any case in which there is also a surviving former spouse of the retired participant who qualifies for an annuity under section 2032(b) of this title may not exceed 55 percent of the portion (if any) of the base for survivor annuities which remains available under section 2032(b)(4)(B) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Effective date and termination of annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An annuity payable from the fund to a surviving spouse under this paragraph shall commence on the day after the retired participant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before the surviving spouse's death or remarriage before attaining age 55. If such survivor annuity is terminated because of remarriage, it shall be restored at the same rate commencing on the date such remarriage is dissolved by death, annulment, or divorce if any lump sum paid upon termination of the annuity is returned to the fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) 18-month open period after retirement to provide spouse coverage</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Survivor annuity elections</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Election when spouse coverage waived at time of retirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A participant or former participant who retires after March 31, 1992 and who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is married at the time of retirement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) elects at that time (in accordance with subsection (b) of this section) to waive a survivor annuity for the spouse,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of the retirement of the participant, elect to have a reduction under subsection (b) of this section made in the annuity of the participant (or in such portion thereof as the participant may designate) in order to provide a survivor annuity for the participant's spouse.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Election when reduced spouse annuity elected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A participant or former participant who retires after March 31, 1992, and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) who, at the time of retirement, is married, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) who, at that time designates (in accordance with subsection (b) of this section) that a portion of the annuity of such participant is to be used as the base for a survivor annuity,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of the retirement of such participant, elect to have a greater portion of the annuity of such participant so used.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Deposit required</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An election under paragraph (1) shall not be effective unless the amount specified in subparagraph (B) is deposited into the fund before the end of that 18-month period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The additional cost to the system that is associated with providing a survivor annuity under subsection (b) of this section and that results from such election, taking into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the difference (for the period between the date on which the annuity of the participant or former participant commences and the date of the election) between the amount paid to such participant or former participant under this subchapter and the amount which would have been paid if such election had been made at the time the participant or former participant applied for the annuity; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:241 --><p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the costs associated with providing for the later election.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Interest</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Voiding of previous elections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An election by a participant or former participant under this subsection voids prospectively any election previously made in the case of such participant under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Reductions in annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An annuity that is reduced in connection with an election under this subsection shall be reduced by the same percentage reductions as were in effect at the time of the retirement of the participant or former participant whose annuity is so reduced.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Rights and obligations resulting from reduced annuity election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Rights and obligations resulting from the election of a reduced annuity under this subsection shall be the same as the rights and obligations that would have resulted had the participant involved elected such annuity at the time of retirement.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Effect of divorce after retirement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Recomputation of retired participant's annuity upon divorce</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An annuity which is reduced under this section (or any similar prior provision of law) to provide a survivor annuity for a spouse shall, if the marriage of the retired participant to such spouse is dissolved, be recomputed and paid for each full month during which a retired participant is not married (or is remarried, if there is no election in effect under paragraph (2)) as if the annuity had not been so reduced, subject to any reduction required to provide a survivor annuity under subsection (b) or (c) of section 2032 of this title or under section 2036 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Election of survivor annuity upon subsequent remarriage</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon remarriage, the retired participant may irrevocably elect, by means of a signed writing received by the Director within one year after such remarriage, to receive a reduced annuity for the purpose of providing an annuity for the new spouse of the retired participant in the event such spouse survives the retired participant. Such reduction shall be equal to the reduction in effect immediately before the dissolution of the previous marriage (unless such reduction is adjusted under section 2032(b)(5) of this title or elected under subparagraph (B)).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) When annuity previously not (or not fully) reduced</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the retired participant's annuity was not reduced (or was not fully reduced) to provide a survivor annuity for the participant's spouse or former spouse as of the time of retirement, the retired participant may make an election under the first sentence of subparagraph (A) upon remarriage to a spouse other than the spouse at the time of retirement. For any remarriage that occurred before August 14, 1991, the retired participant may make such an election within 2 years after such date.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Deposit required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) The retired participant shall, within one year after the date of the remarriage (or by August 14, 1993 for any remarriage that occurred before August 14, 1991), deposit in the fund an amount determined by the Director, as nearly as may be administratively feasible, to reflect the amount by which the retired participant's annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date the annuity commenced, plus interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) The annual rate of interest for each year during which the retired participant's annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date the annuity commenced shall be 6 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) If the retired participant does not make the deposit, the Director shall collect such amount by offset against the participant's annuity, up to a maximum of 25 percent of the net annuity otherwise payable to the retired participant, and the retired participant is deemed to consent to such offset.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) The deposit required by this subparagraph may be made by the surviving spouse of the retired participant.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:243 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Effects of election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An election under this paragraph and the reduction in the participant's annuity shall be effective on the first day of the month beginning 9 months after the date of remarriage. A survivor annuity elected under this paragraph shall be treated in all respects as a survivor annuity under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Coordination of annuities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Surviving spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A surviving spouse whose survivor annuity was terminated because of remarriage before attaining age 55 shall not be entitled under subsection (b)(3)(C) of this section to the restoration of that survivor annuity payable from the fund unless the surviving spouse elects to receive it instead of any other survivor annuity to which the surviving spouse may be entitled under the system or any other retirement system for Government employees by reason of the remarriage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Former spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A surviving former spouse of a participant or retired participant shall not become entitled under section 2032(b) or 2034 of this title to a survivor annuity or to the restoration of a survivor annuity payable from the fund unless the surviving former spouse elects to receive it instead of any other survivor annuity to which the surviving former spouse may be entitled under this or any other retirement system for Government employees on the basis of a marriage to someone other than the participant.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Surviving spouse of post-retirement marriage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A surviving spouse who married a participant after the participant's retirement shall be entitled to a survivor annuity payable from the fund only upon electing that annuity instead of any other survivor annuity to which the surviving spouse may be entitled under this or any other retirement system for Government employees on the basis of a marriage to someone other than the retired participant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Supplemental survivor annuities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Spouse of recalled annuitant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A married recalled annuitant who reverts to retired status with entitlement to a supplemental annuity under section 2111(b) of this title shall, unless the annuitant and the annuitant's spouse jointly elect in writing to the contrary at the time of reversion to retired status, have the supplemental annuity reduced by 10 percent to provide a supplemental survivor annuity for the annuitant's spouse. Such supplemental survivor annuity shall be equal to 55 percent of the supplemental annuity of the annuitant.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall prescribe regulations to provide for the application of paragraph (1) of this subsection and of subsection (b) of section 2111 of this title in any case in which an annuitant has a former spouse who was married to the recalled annuitant at any time during the period of recall service and who qualifies for an annuity under section 2032(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Offset of annuities by amount of social security benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, an annuity (including a disability annuity) payable under this subchapter to an individual described in sections 2021(d)(1) and 2151(c)(1) of this title and any survivor annuity payable under this subchapter on the basis of the service of such individual shall be reduced in a manner consistent with section 8349 of title 5, under conditions consistent with the conditions prescribed in that section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Former spouse share of participant's annuity</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Pro rata share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Unless otherwise expressly provided by a spousal agreement or court order under section 2094(b) of this title, a former spouse of a participant, former participant, or retired participant is entitled to an annuity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if married to the participant, former participant, or retired participant throughout the creditable service of the participant, equal to 50 percent of the annuity of the participant; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if not married to the participant throughout such creditable service, equal to that proportion of 50 percent of such annuity that is the proportion that the number of days of the marriage of the former spouse to the participant during periods of creditable service of such participant under this subchapter bears to the total number of days of such creditable service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Disqualification upon remarriage before age 55</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A former spouse is not qualified for an annuity under this subsection if before the commencement of that annuity the former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Commencement of annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The annuity of a former spouse under this subsection commences on the day the participant upon whose service the annuity is based becomes entitled to an annuity under this subchapter or on the first day of the month after the divorce or annulment involved becomes final, whichever is later.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Termination of annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The annuity of such former spouse and the right thereto terminate on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the last day of the month before the month in which the former spouse dies or remarries before 55 years of age; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the date on which the annuity of the participant terminates (except in the case of an annuity subject to paragraph (5)(B)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Treatment of participant's annuity</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Reduction in participant's annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The annuity payable to any participant shall be reduced by the amount of an annuity under this subsection paid to any former spouse based upon the service of that participant. Such reduction shall be disregarded in calculating&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the survivor annuity for any spouse, former spouse, or other survivor under this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any reduction in the annuity of the participant to provide survivor benefits under subsection (b) of this section or under section 2031(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment when annuitant returns to service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an annuitant whose annuity is reduced under subparagraph (A) is recalled to service under section 2111 of this title, or reinstated or reappointed, in the case of a recovered disability annuitant, or if any annuitant is reemployed as provided for under sections 2112 and 2113 of this title, the pay of that annuitant shall be reduced by the same amount as the annuity would have been reduced if it had continued. Amounts equal to the reductions under this subparagraph shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Disability annuitant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (3), in the case of a former spouse of a disability annuitant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the annuity of that former spouse shall commence on the date on which the participant would qualify on the basis of the participant's creditable service for an annuity under this subchapter (other than a disability annuity) or the date on which the disability annuity begins, whichever is later, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of the annuity of the former spouse shall be calculated on the basis of the annuity for which the participant would otherwise so qualify.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Election of benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A former spouse of a participant, former participant, or retired participant shall not become entitled under this subsection to an annuity payable from the fund unless the former spouse elects to receive it instead of any survivor annuity to which the former spouse may be entitled under this or any other retirement system for Government employees on the basis of a marriage to someone other than the participant.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Limitation in case of multiple former spouse annuities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No spousal agreement or court order under section 2094(b) of this title involving a partici<!-- PDFPage:245 -->pant may provide for an annuity or a combination of annuities under this subsection that exceeds the annuity of the participant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Former spouse survivor annuity</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Pro rata share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to any election under section 2031(b)(1)(B) and (C) of this title and unless otherwise expressly provided by a spousal agreement or court order under section 2094(b) of this title, if an annuitant is survived by a former spouse, the former spouse shall be entitled&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if married to the annuitant throughout the creditable service of the annuitant, to a survivor annuity equal to 55 percent of the unreduced amount of the annuitant's annuity, as computed under section 2031(a) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if not married to the annuitant throughout such creditable service, to a survivor annuity equal to that proportion of 55 percent of the unreduced amount of such annuity that is the proportion that the number of days of the marriage of the former spouse to the participant during periods of creditable service of such participant under this subchapter bears to the total number of days of such creditable service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Disqualification upon remarriage before age 55</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A former spouse shall not be qualified for an annuity under this subsection if before the commencement of that annuity the former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Commencement, termination, and restoration of annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An annuity payable from the fund under this subchapter to a surviving former spouse under this subsection shall commence on the day after the annuitant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before the former spouse's death or remarriage before attaining age 55. If such a survivor annuity is terminated because of remarriage, it shall be restored at the same rate commencing on the date such remarriage is dissolved by death, annulment, or divorce if any lump sum paid upon termination of the annuity is returned to the fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Survivor annuity amount</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Maximum amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The maximum survivor annuity or combination of survivor annuities under this subsection (and section 2031(b)(3) of this title) with respect to any participant may not exceed 55 percent of the full amount of the participant's annuity, as calculated under section 2031(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation on other survivor annuities based on service of same participant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Once a survivor annuity has been provided under this subsection for any former spouse, a survivor annuity for another individual may thereafter be provided under this subsection (or section 2031(b)(3) of this title) with respect to the participant only for that portion (if any) of the maximum available which is not committed for survivor benefits for any former spouse whose prospective right to such annuity has not terminated by reason of death or remarriage.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Finality of court order upon death of participant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">After the death of a participant or retired participant, a court order under section 2094(b) of this title may not adjust the amount of the annuity of a former spouse of that participant or retired participant under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Effect of termination of former spouse entitlement</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Recomputation of participant's annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a former spouse of a retired participant dies or remarries before attaining age 55, the annuity of the retired participant, if reduced to provide a survivor annuity for that former spouse, shall be recomputed and paid, effective on the first day of the month beginning after such death or remarriage, as if the annuity had not been so reduced, unless an election is in effect under subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Election of spouse annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to paragraph (4)(B), the participant may elect in writing within one year after receipt of notice of the death or remarriage of the former spouse to continue the reduction in order to provide a higher survivor annuity under section 2031(b)(3) of this title for any spouse of the participant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Optional additional survivor annuities for other former spouse or surviving spouse</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any participant providing a survivor annuity under subsection (b) of this section for a former spouse&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such participant may elect, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a spousal agreement or court order under section 2094(b) of this title may provide for,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">an additional survivor annuity under this subsection for any other former spouse or spouse surviving the participant, if the participant satisfactorily passes a physical examination as prescribed by the Director.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Neither the total amount of survivor annuity or annuities under this subsection with respect to any participant, nor the survivor annuity or annuities for any one surviving spouse or former spouse of such participant under this section or section 2031 of this title, may exceed 55 percent of the unreduced amount of the participant's annuity, as computed under section 2031(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Contribution for additional annuities</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Provision of additional survivor annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In accordance with regulations which the Director shall prescribe, the participant involved may provide for any annuity under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) by a reduction in the annuity or an allotment from the basic pay of the participant;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:246 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by a lump-sum payment or installment payments to the fund; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) by any combination thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Actuarial equivalence to benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The present value of the total amount to accrue to the fund under subparagraph (A) to provide any annuity under this subsection shall be actuarially equivalent in value to such annuity, as calculated upon such tables of mortality as may from time to time be prescribed for this purpose by the Director.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Effect of former spouse's death or disqualification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a former spouse predeceases the participant or remarries before attaining age 55 (or, in the case of a spouse, the spouse predeceases the participant or does not qualify as a former spouse upon dissolution of the marriage)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if an annuity reduction or pay allotment under subparagraph (A) is in effect for that spouse or former spouse, the annuity shall be recomputed and paid as if it had not been reduced or the pay allotment terminated, as the case may be; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any amount accruing to the fund under subparagraph (A) shall be refunded, but only to the extent that such amount may have exceeded the actuarial cost of providing benefits under this subsection for the period such benefits were provided, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Director.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Recomputation upon death or remarriage of former spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Under regulations prescribed by the Director, an annuity shall be recomputed (or a pay allotment terminated or adjusted), and a refund provided (if appropriate), in a manner comparable to that provided under subparagraph (C), in order to reflect a termination or reduction of future benefits under this subsection for a spouse in the event a former spouse of the participant dies or remarries before attaining age 55 and an increased annuity is provided for that spouse in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Commencement and termination of additional survivor annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An annuity payable under this subsection to a spouse or former spouse shall commence on the day after the participant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before the spouse's or the former spouse's death or remarriage before attaining age 55.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Nonapplicability of COLA provision</h4>
