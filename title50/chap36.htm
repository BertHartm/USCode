<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power, as defined in section 1801(a)(1), (2), or (3) of this title, and each of the facilities or places at which the surveillance is directed is owned, leased, or exclusively used by that foreign power, the order need not contain the information required by subparagraphs (C), (D), and (F) of subsection (c)(1) of this section, but shall generally describe the information sought, the communications or activities to be subjected to the surveillance, and the type of electronic surveillance involved, including whether physical entry is required.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Duration of order; extensions; review of circumstances under which information was acquired, retained or disseminated</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the factual basis for issuance of an order under this subchapter to approve such surveillance exists;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">he may authorize the emergency employment of electronic surveillance if a judge having jurisdiction under section 1803 of this title is informed by the Attorney General or his designee at the time of such authorization that the decision has been made to employ emergency electronic surveillance and if an application in accordance with this subchapter is made to that judge as soon as practicable, but not more than 72 hours after the Attorney General authorizes such surveillance. If the Attorney General authorizes such emergency employment of electronic surveillance, he shall require that the minimization procedures required by this subchapter for the issuance of a judicial order be followed. In the absence of a judicial order approving such electronic surveillance, the surveillance shall terminate when the information sought is obtained, when the application for the order is denied, or after the expiration of 72 hours from the time of authorization by the At<!-- PDFPage:333 -->torney General, whichever is earliest. In the event that such application for approval is denied, or in any other case where the electronic surveillance is terminated and no order is issued approving the surveillance, no information obtained or evidence derived from such surveillance shall be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, office, agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other authority of the United States, a State, or political subdivision thereof, and no information concerning any United States person acquired from such surveillance shall subsequently be used or disclosed in any other manner by Federal officers or employees without the consent of such person, except with the approval of the Attorney General if the information indicates a threat of death or serious bodily harm to any person. A denial of the application made under this subsection may be reviewed as provided in section 1803 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, officers, employees, or agents of the United States are authorized in the normal course of their official duties to conduct electronic surveillance not targeted against the communications of any particular person or persons, under procedures approved by the Attorney General, solely to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) test the capability of electronic equipment, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) it is not reasonable to obtain the consent of the persons incidentally subjected to the surveillance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the test is limited in extent and duration to that necessary to determine the capability of the equipment;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) it is not reasonable to obtain the consent of persons incidentally subjected to the surveillance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such electronic surveillance is limited in extent and duration to that necessary to determine the existence and capability of such equipment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any information acquired by such surveillance is used only to enforce chapter 119 of title 18, or section 605 of title 47, or to protect information from unauthorized surveillance; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) it is not reasonable to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) obtain the consent of the persons incidentally subjected to the surveillance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) train persons in the course of surveillances otherwise authorized by this subchapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) train persons in the use of such equipment without engaging in electronic surveillance;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such electronic surveillance is limited in extent and duration to that necessary to train the personnel in the use of the equipment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) no contents of any communication acquired are retained or disseminated for any purpose, but are destroyed as soon as reasonably possible.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Retention of certifications, applications and orders</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The presiding judge shall immediately assign a petition under clause (i) to 1 of the judges serving in the pool established by section 1803(e)(1) of this title.

<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) A judge considering a petition to modify or set aside a nondisclosure order may grant such petition only if the judge finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of the United States, interfere with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation, interfere with diplomatic relations, or endanger the life or physical safety of any person.</p>
