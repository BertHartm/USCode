<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the President, acting through the Attorney General, may authorize physical searches without a court order under this subchapter to acquire foreign intelligence information for periods of up to one year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Attorney General certifies in writing under oath that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the physical search is solely directed at premises, information, material, or property used exclusively by, or under the open and exclusive control of, a foreign power or powers (as defined in section 1801(a)(1), (2), or (3) of this title);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) there is no substantial likelihood that the physical search will involve the premises, information, material, or property of a United States person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the proposed minimization procedures with respect to such physical search meet the definition of minimization procedures under paragraphs (1) through (4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1822_1_target" name="1822_1">1</a></sup> of section 1821(4) of this title; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Attorney General reports such minimization procedures and any changes thereto to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate at least 30 days before their effective date, unless the Attorney General determines that immediate action is required and notifies the committees immediately of such minimization procedures and the reason for their becoming effective immediately.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A physical search authorized by this subsection may be conducted only in accordance with the certification and minimization procedures adopted by the Attorney General. The Attorney General shall assess compliance with such procedures and shall report such assessments to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate under the provisions of section 1826 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Attorney General shall immediately transmit under seal to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court a copy of the certification.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an application for a court order with respect to the physical search is made under section 1821(4) of this title and section 1823 of this title; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) furnish all information, facilities, or assistance necessary to accomplish the physical search in such a manner as will protect its secrecy and produce a minimum of interference with the services that such landlord, custodian, or other person is providing the target of the physical search; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) maintain under security procedures approved by the Attorney General and the Director of Central Intelligence any records concerning the search or the aid furnished that such person wishes to retain.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application for order; authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Applications for a court order under this subchapter are authorized if the President has, by written authorization, empowered the Attorney General to approve applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a judge of the court to whom application is made may grant an order in accordance with section 1824 of this title approving a physical search in the United States of the premises, property, information, or material of a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power for the purpose of collecting foreign intelligence information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Jurisdiction of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court shall have jurisdiction to hear applications for and grant orders approving a physical search for the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence information anywhere within the United States under the procedures set forth in this subchapter, except that no judge shall hear the same application which has been denied previously by another judge designated under section 1803(a) of this title. If any judge so designated denies an application for an order authorizing a physical search under this subchapter, such judge shall provide immediately for the record a written statement of each reason for such decision and, on motion of the United States, the record shall be transmitted, under seal, to the court of review established under section 1803(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Court of review; record; transmittal to Supreme Court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The court of review established under section 1803(b) of this title shall have jurisdiction to review the denial of any application made under <!-- PDFPage:251 -->this subchapter. If such court determines that the application was properly denied, the court shall immediately provide for the record a written statement of each reason for its decision and, on petition of the United States for a writ of certiorari, the record shall be transmitted under seal to the Supreme Court, which shall have jurisdiction to review such decision.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Expeditious conduct of proceedings; security measures for maintenance of records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Judicial proceedings under this subchapter shall be concluded as expeditiously as possible. The record of proceedings under this subchapter, including applications made and orders granted, shall be maintained under security measures established by the Chief Justice of the United States in consultation with the Attorney General and the Director of Central Intelligence.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Specifications and directions of orders</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) that such landlord, custodian, or other person maintain under security procedures approved by the Attorney General and the Director of Central Intelligence any records concerning the search or the aid furnished that such person wishes to retain;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) that the Federal officer conducting the physical search promptly report to the court the circumstances and results of the physical search.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Duration of order; extensions; assessment of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An order issued under this section may approve a physical search for the period necessary to achieve its purpose, or for forty-five days, whichever is less, except that an order under this section shall approve a physical search targeted against a foreign power, as defined in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of section 1801(a) of this title, for the period specified in the application or for one year, whichever is less.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Extensions of an order issued under this subchapter may be granted on the same basis as the original order upon an application for an extension and new findings made in the same manner as required for the original order, except that an extension of an order under this chapter for a physical search targeted against a foreign power, as defined in section 1801(a)(5) or (6) of this title, or against a foreign power, as defined in section 1801(a)(4) of this title, that is not a United States person, may be for a period not to exceed one year if the judge finds probable cause to believe that no property of any individual United States person will be acquired during the period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) At or before the end of the period of time for which a physical search is approved by an order or an extension, or at any time after a <!-- PDFPage:253 -->physical search is carried out, the judge may assess compliance with the minimization procedures by reviewing the circumstances under which information concerning United States persons was acquired, retained, or disseminated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Emergency orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, whenever the Attorney General reasonably makes the determination specified in subparagraph (B), the Attorney General may authorize the execution of an emergency physical search if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a judge having jurisdiction under section 1803 of this title is informed by the Attorney General or the Attorney General's designee at the time of such authorization that the decision has been made to execute an emergency search, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an application in accordance with this subchapter is made to that judge as soon as practicable but not more than 24 hours after the Attorney General authorizes such search.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The determination referred to in subparagraph (A) is a determination that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) an emergency situation exists with respect to the execution of a physical search to obtain foreign intelligence information before an order authorizing such search can with due diligence be obtained, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the factual basis for issuance of an order under this subchapter to approve such a search exists.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Attorney General authorizes an emergency search under paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall require that the minimization procedures required by this subchapter for the issuance of a judicial order be followed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the absence of a judicial order approving such a physical search, the search shall terminate the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date on which the information sought is obtained;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the date on which the application for the order is denied; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the expiration of 24 hours from the time of authorization by the Attorney General.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the event that such application for approval is denied, or in any other case where the physical search is terminated and no order is issued approving the search, no information obtained or evidence derived from such search shall be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, office, agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other authority of the United States, a State, or political subdivision thereof, and no information concerning any United States person acquired from such search shall subsequently be used or disclosed in any other manner by Federal officers or employees without the consent of such person, except with the approval of the Attorney General, if the information indicates a threat of death or serious bodily harm to any person. A denial of the application made under this subsection may be reviewed as provided in section 1822 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Retention of applications and orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Applications made and orders granted under this subchapter shall be retained for a period of at least 10 years from the date of the application.</p>
