<p class="note-body">Sections 812 to 814 were omitted as terminated pursuant to section 814 of this Appendix.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 812, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, &sect;7, 56 Stat. 465, amended sections 350 and 350i of former Title 34, Navy. It was repealed insofar as it related to the Navy and Marine Corps by act Aug. 7, 1947, ch. 512, title IV, &sect;426(a), 61 Stat. 880. It was superseded with respect to the Coast Guard by act June 3, 1948, ch. 395, 62 Stat. 302.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 813, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, &sect;8, 56 Stat. 465, provided: &ldquo;The provisions of this Act [sections 806 to 814 of this Appendix] except as may be necessary to adapt the said provisions to the Coast Guard, shall apply to officer personnel of the Coast Guard in like manner and to the same extent and with the same relative conditions in all respects as are provided for the officer personnel of the Navy and Marine Corps.&rdquo; It appears that section 808 of this Appendix does not apply to the Coast Guard since it has no staff officers and that section 809 does not apply because it amends provisions relating only to the Navy and Marine Corps. As pointed out in notes under sections 806, 807, 810, and 812, they have been superseded with respect to the Coast Guard.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 814, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, &sect;9, 56 Stat. 465, prohibited any reduction of pay by virtue of sections 806 to 814 of this Appendix, and provided for termination of sections 806 to 814 of this Appendix on June 30 of fiscal year following that in which World War II ended. See Termination of State of War notes preceding section 1, of this Appendix. See note for former section 809 of this Appendix for its disposition, such section having been excepted from the termination provisions.</p>
