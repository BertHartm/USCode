(b)(2) of section 3158 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 (42 U.S.C. 7274q(b)(2)) be amended by adding a subpar. (D), was executed to that section as renumbered by Pub.

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;7, which directed the amendment of &ldquo;Title 42 U.S.C. 7274g&rdquo; by adding subpar. (D) to subsec. (b)(2), was probably intended to amend section 3158 of Pub. L. 105&ndash;85, which was formerly classified to section 7274q of title 42 prior to renumbering and transfer to this section by Pub. L. 108&ndash;136. However, the amendment was not executed in view of the enactment of section 504 of Pub. L. 108&ndash;137 which added a substantially identical subpar. (D).
