<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the physical search is solely directed at premises, information, material, or property used exclusively by, or under the open and exclusive control of, a foreign power or powers (as defined in section 1801(a)(1), (2), or (3) of this title);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) there is no substantial likelihood that the physical search will involve the premises, information, material, or property of a United States person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the proposed minimization procedures with respect to such physical search meet the definition of minimization procedures under paragraphs (1) through (4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1822_1_target" name="1822_1">1</a></sup> of section 1821(4) of this title; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A physical search authorized by this subsection may be conducted only in accordance with the certification and minimization procedures adopted by the Attorney General.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of probable cause</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining whether or not probable cause exists for purposes of an order under subsection (a)(3) of this section, a judge may consider past activities of the target, as well as facts and circumstances relating to current or future activities of the target.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that, upon the request of the applicant, a specified landlord, custodian, or other specified person furnish the applicant forthwith all information, facilities, or assistance necessary to accomplish the physical search in such a manner as will protect its secrecy and produce a minimum of interference with the services that such landlord, custodian, or other person is providing the target of the physical search;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) that such landlord, custodian, or other person maintain under security procedures approved by the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence any records concerning the search or the aid furnished that such person wishes to retain;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Extensions of an order issued under this subchapter may be granted on the same basis as the original order upon an application for an extension and new findings made in the same manner as required for the original order, except that an extension of an order under this chapter for a physical search targeted against a foreign power, as defined in section 1801(a)(5) or (6) of this title, or against a foreign power, as defined in section 1801(a)(4) of this title, that is not a United States person, or against an agent of a foreign power as defined in section 1801(b)(1)(A) of this title, may be for a period not to exceed one year if the judge finds probable cause to believe that no property of any individual United States person will be acquired during the period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) At or before the end of the period of time for which a physical search is approved by an order or an extension, or at any time after a physical search is carried out, the judge may assess compliance with the minimization proce<!-- PDFPage:372 -->dures by reviewing the circumstances under which information concerning United States persons was acquired, retained, or disseminated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Emergency orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, whenever the Attorney General reasonably makes the determination specified in subparagraph (B), the Attorney General may authorize the execution of an emergency physical search if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a judge having jurisdiction under section 1803 of this title is informed by the Attorney General or the Attorney General's designee at the time of such authorization that the decision has been made to execute an emergency search, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an application in accordance with this subchapter is made to that judge as soon as practicable but not more than 72 hours after the Attorney General authorizes such search.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) an emergency situation exists with respect to the execution of a physical search to obtain foreign intelligence information before an order authorizing such search can with due diligence be obtained, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the factual basis for issuance of an order under this subchapter to approve such a search exists.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Attorney General authorizes an emergency search under paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall require that the minimization procedures required by this subchapter for the issuance of a judicial order be followed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the absence of a judicial order approving such a physical search, the search shall terminate the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date on which the information sought is obtained;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the date on which the application for the order is denied; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the expiration of 72 hours from the time of authorization by the Attorney General.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the event that such application for approval is denied, or in any other case where the physical search is terminated and no order is issued approving the search, no information obtained or evidence derived from such search shall be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, office, agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other authority of the United States, a State, or political subdivision thereof, and no information concerning any United States person acquired from such search shall subsequently be used or disclosed in any other manner by Federal officers or employees without the consent of such person, except with the approval of the Attorney General, if the information indicates a threat of death or serious bodily harm to any person. A denial of the application made under this subsection may be reviewed as provided in section 1822 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Retention of applications and orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Applications made and orders granted under this subchapter shall be retained for a period of at least 10 years from the date of the application.</p>
