<p class="note-body">Proc. No. 7463, Sept. 14, 2001, 66 F.R. 48199, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">A national emergency exists by reason of the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center, New York, New York, and the Pentagon, and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W.

<p class="note-body">This proclamation immediately shall be published in the Federal Register or disseminated through the Emergency Federal Register, and transmitted to the Congress.</p>

<p class="note-body">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-sixth.</p>
<p class="presidential-signature">George W. Bush.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="note-body">Notice of President of the United States, dated Sept. 5, 2006, 71 F.R. 52733, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Consistent with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency I declared on September 14, 2001, in Proclamation 7463 [set out above], with respect to the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center, New York, New York, the Pentagon, and aboard United Airlines flight 93, and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Because the terrorist threat continues, the national emergency declared on September 14, 2001, and the measures adopted to deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond September 14, 2006. Therefore, I am continuing in effect for an additional year the national emergency I declared on September 14, 2001, with respect to the terrorist threat.</p>
<p class="note-body">This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.</p>
