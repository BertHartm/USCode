<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the United States should undertake and support an enduring stockpile stewardship program and maintain and modernize nuclear weapons production capabilities and capacities to ensure the safety, security, reliability, and credibility of the United States nuclear deterrent and to meet requirements for hedging against possible international developments or technical problems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the United States should maintain nuclear weapons laboratories and plants and preserve the intellectual infrastructure, including competencies and skill sets; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the United States should provide the necessary resources to achieve these goals, using as a starting point the levels set forth in the President's 10-year plan provided to Congress pursuant to section 1251 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111&ndash;84; 123 Stat. 2549).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such investments could enable additional future reductions in the hedge stockpile.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Report required</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives the assessment described in subparagraph (A), unchanged, together with the explanatory views of the Secretary, as the Secretary deems appropriate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives a report describing the current capacities of the United States nuclear weapons infrastructure to respond to a strategic development or technical problem in the United States nuclear weapons stockpile.</p>
