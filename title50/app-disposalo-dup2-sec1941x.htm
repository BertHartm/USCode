<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Negotiation period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If one or more proposals are received for the purchase of Plancor Numbered 980 within the time period specified in subsection (a), the Commission, notwithstanding the expiration of the period for negotiation specified in section 7 (f) [section 1941e(f) of this Appendix], shall negotiate with those submitting the proposals for a period of not to exceed seventy-five days for the purpose of entering into a definite contract of sale.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Report to Congress; transfer period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within ten days after the termination of the actual negotiation period referred to in subsection (b), or, if Congress is not then in session, within ten days after Congress next convenes, the Commission shall prepare and submit to the Congress a report containing with respect to the disposal under this section of Plancor Numbered 980, the information described in paragraphs (1) to (5), inclusive, and paragraph (8) of section 9(a) [section 1941g(a) of this Appendix]. Unless the contract is disapproved by either House of the Congress by a resolution prior to the expiration of thirty days of continuous session (as defined in section 9(c) [section 1941g(c) of this Appendix]) of the Congress following the date upon which the report is submitted to it, upon the expiration of such thirty-day period the contract shall become fully effective and the Commission shall proceed to carry it out, and transfer of possession of the facility sold shall be made as soon as practicable but in any event within thirty days after the expiration of such thirty-day period. The failure to complete transfer of possession within thirty days after the expiration of the period for congressional review shall not give rise to or be the basis of rescission of the contract of sale.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If, upon termination of the transfer period provided for in subsection (c), no contract for the sale of Plancor Numbered 980 has become effective, the operating agency last designated by the President shall continue to maintain said Plancor in adequate standby condition under the provisions of section 8 of the Rubber Producing Facilities Disposal Act of 1953 [section 1941f of this Appendix].</p>
