<p class="note-body">Act July 26, 1956, ch. 738, 70 Stat. 657, provided: &ldquo;That the Government laboratories at Akron, Ohio, now under control of the National Science Foundation are hereby transferred to the General Services Administration for disposal in accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 [now chapters 1 to 11 of Title 40, Public Buildings, Property, and Works, and title III of the Act of June 30, 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 et seq.)], except that the Administrator of General Services shall first offer the laboratories for public sale before seeking to dispose of them by transfer or assignment to any Federal agency. The Administrator of General Services, before he offers the laboratories to the public for sale, shall ascertain what the value of the laboratories would be to Government agencies which would make substantial use thereof, and the Administrator shall not sell the laboratories to the public unless he finds, after consultation with the Director of the Budget Bureau, that such sale to the public would be in the best interests of the United States, taking into consideration among other relevant factors the value of the laboratories to any interested agency and the amounts offered by public bidders. The National Science Foundation is authorized to reimburse the General Services Administration in advance for expenses necessary for the protection and maintenance of the laboratories up to June 30, 1957.&rdquo;</p>
