<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) On July 23, 2004, Congress declared, &lsquo;the atrocities unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, are genocide&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) On September 9, 2004, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell stated before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, &lsquo;genocide has occurred and may still be occurring in Darfur&rsquo;, and &lsquo;the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed bear responsibility&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) On September 21, 2004, in an address before the United Nations General Assembly, President George W. Bush affirmed the Secretary of State's finding and stated, &lsquo;[a]t this hour, the world is witnessing terrible suffering and horrible crimes in the Darfur region of Sudan, crimes my government has concluded are genocide&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) On July 30, 2004, the United Nations Security Council passed Security Council Resolution 1556 (2004), calling upon the Government of Sudan to disarm the Janjaweed militias and to apprehend and bring to justice Janjaweed leaders and their associates who have incited and carried out violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and establishing a ban on the sale or supply of arms and related materiel of all types, including the provision of related technical training or assistance, to all nongovernmental entities and individuals, including the Janjaweed.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) On September 18, 2004, the United Nations Security Council passed Security Council Resolution 1564 (2004), determining that the Government of Sudan had failed to meet its obligations under Security Council Resolution 1556 (2004), calling for a military flight ban in and over the Darfur region, demanding the names of Janjaweed militiamen disarmed and arrested for verification, establishing an International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur to investigate violations of international humanitarian and human rights laws, and threatening sanctions should the Government of Sudan fail to fully comply with Security Council Resolutions 1556 (2004) and 1564 (2004), including such actions as to affect Sudan's petroleum sector or individual members of the Government of Sudan.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The Report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, submitted to the United Nations Secretary-General on January 25, 2005, established that the &lsquo;Government of the Sudan and the Janjaweed are responsible for serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law amounting to crimes under international law,&rsquo; that &lsquo;these acts were conducted on a widespread and systematic basis, and therefore may amount to crimes against humanity,&rsquo; and that officials of the Government of Sudan and other individuals may have acted with &lsquo;genocidal intent&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) On March 24, 2005, the United Nations Security Council passed Security Council Resolution 1590 (2005), establishing the United Nations Mission in Sudan (referred to in this section as the &lsquo;UNMIS&rsquo;), consisting of up to 10,000 military personnel and 715 civilian police tasked with supporting the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan and to &lsquo;closely and continuously liaise and coordinate at all levels with the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS)&rsquo;, which had been established by the African Union on May 24, 2004, to monitor the implementation of the N'Djamena Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement, signed on April 8, 2004, &lsquo;with a view towards expeditiously reinforcing the effort to foster peace in Darfur&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) On March 29, 2005, the United Nations Security Council passed Security Council Resolution 1591 (2005), extending the military embargo established by Security Council Resolution 1556 (2004) to all the parties to the N'Djamena Ceasefire Agreement of April 8, 2004, and any other belligerents in the states of North Darfur, South Darfur, and West Darfur, calling for an asset freeze and travel ban against those individuals who impede the peace process, constitute a threat to stability in Darfur and the region, commit violations of international humanitarian or human rights law or other atrocities, are responsible for offensive military overflights, or violate the military embargo, and establishing a Committee of the Security Council and a panel of experts to assist in monitoring compliance with Security Council Resolutions 1556 (2004) and 1591 (2005).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) On March 31, 2005, the United Nations Security Council passed Security Council Resolution 1593 (2005), referring the situation in Darfur since July 1, 2002, to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and calling on the Government of Sudan and all parties to the conflict to cooperate fully with the Court.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) On July 30, 2005, Dr. John Garang de Mabior, the newly appointed Vice President of Sudan and the leader of the SPLM/A for the past 21 years, was killed <!-- PDFPage:288 -->in a tragic helicopter crash in Southern Sudan, sparking riots in Khartoum and challenging the commitment of all Sudanese to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) On January 12, 2006, the African Union Peace and Security Council issued a communique endorsing, in principle, a transition from AMIS to a United Nations peacekeeping operation and requested the Chairperson of the Council to initiate consultations with the United Nations and other stakeholders toward this end.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) On February 3, 2006, the United Nations Security Council issued a Presidential Statement authorizing the initiation of contingency planning for a transition from AMIS to a United Nations peacekeeping operation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) On March 10, 2006, the African Union Peace and Security Council extended the mandate of AMIS, which had reached a force size of 7,000, to September 30, 2006, while simultaneously endorsing the transition of AMIS to a United Nations peacekeeping operation and setting April 30, 2006 as the deadline for reaching an agreement to resolve the crisis in Darfur.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) On March 24, 2006, the United Nations Security Council passed Security Council Resolution 1663 (2006), which&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) welcomes the African Peace and Security Council's March 10, 2006 communique; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) requests that the United Nations Secretary-General, jointly with the African Union and in consultation with the parties to the Abuja Peace Talks, expedite planning for the transition of AMIS to a United Nations peacekeeping operation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) On March 29, 2006, during a speech at Freedom House, President Bush called for a transition to a United Nations peacekeeping operation and &lsquo;additional forces with a NATO overlay .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to provide logistical and command-and-control and airlift capacity, but also to send a clear signal to parties involved that the west is determined to help effect a settlement.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) On April 25, 2006, the United Nations Security Council passed Security Council Resolution 1672 (2006), unanimously imposing targeted financial sanctions and travel restrictions on 4 individuals who had been identified as those who, among other acts, &lsquo;impede the peace process, constitute a threat to stability in Darfur and the region, commit violations of international humanitarian or human rights law or other atrocities&rsquo;, including the Commander of the Western Military Region for the armed forces of Sudan, the Paramount Chief of the Jalul Tribe in North Darfur, the Commander of the Sudan Liberation Army, and the Field Commander of the National Movement for Reform and Development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) On May 5, 2006, under the auspices of African Union mediation and the direct engagement of the international community, including the United States, the Government of Sudan and the largest rebel faction in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement, led by Minni Minnawi, signed the Darfur Peace Agreement, which addresses security, power sharing, and wealth sharing issues between the parties.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) In August 2006, the Sudanese government began to amass military forces and equipment in the Darfur region in contravention of the Darfur Peace Agreement to which they are signatories in what appears to be preliminary to full scale war.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(19) On August 30, 2006, the United Nations Security Council passed Security Council Resolution 1706 (2006), without dissent and with abstentions by China, Russian Federation, and Qatar, thereby asserting that the existing United Nations Mission in Sudan &lsquo;shall take over from AMIS responsibility for supporting the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement upon the expiration of AMIS&rsquo; mandate but in any event no later than 31 December 2006&rsquo;, and that UNMIS &lsquo;shall be strengthened by up to 17,300 military personnel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 3,300 civilian police personnel and up to 16 Formed Police Units&rsquo;, which &lsquo;shall begin to be deployed [to Darfur] no later than 1 October 2006&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(20) Between August 30 and September 3, 2006, President Bashir and other senior members of his administration have publicly rejected United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706 (2006), calling it illegal and a western invasion of his country, despite the current presence of 10,000 United Nations peacekeepers under the UNMIS peacekeeping force.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(21) Since 1993, the Secretary of State has determined, pursuant to section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 App. U.S.C. 2405(j)), that Sudan is a country, the government of which has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, thereby restricting United States assistance, defense exports and sales, and financial and other transactions with the Government of Sudan.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the genocide unfolding in the Darfur region of Sudan is characterized by acts of terrorism and atrocities directed against civilians, including mass murder, rape, and sexual violence committed by the Janjaweed and associated militias with the complicity and support of the National Congress Party-led faction of the Government of Sudan;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) all parties to the conflict in the Darfur region have continued to violate the N'Djamena Ceasefire Agreement of April 8, 2004, and the Abuja Protocols of November 9, 2004, and violence against civilians, humanitarian aid workers, and personnel of AMIS is increasing;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the African Union should immediately make all necessary preparations for an orderly transition to a United Nations peacekeeping operation, which will maintain an appropriate level of African participation, with a mandate to protect civilians and humanitarian operations, assist in the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement, and deter violence in the Darfur region;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the international community, including the United States and the European Union, should immediately act to mobilize sufficient political, military, and financial resources through the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to support the transition of AMIS to a United Nations peacekeeping operation with the size, strength, and capacity necessary to protect civilians and humanitarian operations, to assist with the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement, and to end the continued violence in the Darfur region;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) if an expanded and reinforced AMIS or subsequent United Nations peacekeeping operation fails to stop genocide in the Darfur region, the international community should take additional measures to prevent and suppress acts of genocide in the Darfur region;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) acting under article 5 of the Charter of the United Nations, the United Nations Security Council should call for suspension of the Government of Sudan's rights and privileges of membership by the General Assembly until such time as the Government of Sudan has honored pledges to cease attacks upon civilians, demobilize and demilitarize the Janjaweed and associated militias, and grant free and unfettered access for deliveries of humanitarian assistance in the Darfur region;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the President should use all necessary and appropriate diplomatic means to ensure the full discharge of the responsibilities of the Committee of the United Nations Security Council and the panel of experts established pursuant to section 3(a) of Security Council Resolution 1591 (2005);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) the President should direct the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States to urge the adoption of a resolution by the United Nations Security Council that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) extends the military embargo established by United Nations Security Resolutions 1556 (2004) and <!-- PDFPage:289 -->1591 (2005) to include a total ban on the sale or supply of offensive military equipment to the Government of Sudan, except for use in an internationally recognized demobilization program or for nonlethal assistance necessary to carry out elements of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan or the Darfur Peace Agreement; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) calls upon those member states of the United Nations that continue to undermine efforts to foster peace in Sudan by providing military assistance to the Government of Sudan, government supported militias, or any rebel group operating in Darfur in violation of the embargo on such assistance and equipment, as called for in United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1556 (2004) and 1591 (2005), to immediately cease and desist.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the United States should not provide assistance to the Government of Sudan, other than assistance necessary for the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan and the Darfur Peace Agreement, the support of the regional Government of Southern Sudan, the Transitional Darfur Regional Authority, and marginalized areas in Northern Sudan (including the Nuba Mountains, Southern Blue Nile, Abyei, Eastern Sudan (Beja), Darfur, and Nubia), or for humanitarian purposes in Sudan, until the Government of Sudan has honored pledges to cease attacks upon civilians, demobilize and demilitarize the Janjaweed and associated militias, grant free and unfettered access for deliveries of humanitarian assistance in the Darfur region, and allow for the safe and voluntary return of refugees and internally displaced persons;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) the President should seek to assist members of the Sudanese diaspora in the United States by establishing a student loan forgiveness program for those individuals who commit to return to Southern Sudan for a period of not less than 5 years for the purpose of contributing professional skills needed for the reconstruction of Southern Sudan;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) the Presidential Special Envoy for Sudan should be provided with appropriate resources and a clear mandate to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) provide stewardship of efforts to implement the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan and the Darfur Peace Agreement;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) seek ways to bring stability and peace to the Darfur region;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) address instability elsewhere in Sudan, Chad, and northern Uganda; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) pursue a truly comprehensive peace throughout the region;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) the international community should strongly condemn attacks against humanitarian workers and African Union personnel, and the forcible recruitment of refugees and internally displaced persons from camps in Chad and Sudan, and demand that all armed groups in the region, including the forces of the Government of Sudan, the Janjaweed, associated militias, the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army, the Justice and Equality Movement, the National Movement for Reform and Development (NMRD), and all other armed groups refrain from such activities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) the United States should fully support the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan and the Darfur Peace Agreement and urge rapid implementation of their terms;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) the May 5, 2006[,] signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan Liberation Movement was a positive development in a situation that has seen little political progress in 2 years and should be seized upon by all sides to begin the arduous process of post-conflict reconstruction, restitution, justice, and reconciliation; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) the new leadership of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (referred to in this paragraph as &lsquo;SPLM&rsquo;) should&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) seek to transform SPLM into an inclusive, transparent, and democratic body;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) reaffirm the commitment of SPLM to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(i) bring peace to Southern Sudan, the Darfur region, and Eastern Sudan; and</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(ii) eliminate safe haven for regional rebel movements, such as the Lord's Resistance Army; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) remain united in the face of efforts to undermine SPLM.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Consent</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the President consents to the transfer of such assistance to anyone not an officer, employee, or agent of AMIS (or subsequent United Nations peacekeeping operation), or agrees to permit the use of such assistance for any purposes other than those for which such assistance was furnished, the President shall immediately notify the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International Relations [now Committee on Foreign Affairs] of the House of Representatives in accordance with the procedures applicable to reprogramming notifications under section 634A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2394&ndash;1).</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has failed to transfer power to the National League for Democracy (NLD) whose parliamentarians won an overwhelming victory in the 1990 elections in Burma.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The SPDC has failed to enter into meaningful, political dialogue with the NLD and ethnic minorities and has dismissed the efforts of United Nations Special Envoy Razali bin Ismail to further such dialogue.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) According to the State Department's &lsquo;Report to the Congress Regarding Conditions in Burma and U.S. Policy Toward Burma&rsquo; dated March 28, 2003, the SPDC has become &lsquo;more confrontational&rsquo; in its exchanges with the NLD.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) On May 30, 2003, the SPDC, threatened by continued support for the NLD throughout Burma, brutally attacked NLD supporters, killed and injured scores of civilians, and arrested democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi and other activists.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The SPDC continues egregious human rights violations against Burmese citizens, uses rape as a weapon of intimidation and torture against women, and forcibly conscripts child-soldiers for the use in fighting indigenous ethnic groups.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The SPDC is engaged in ethnic cleansing against minorities within Burma, including the Karen, Karenni, and Shan people, which constitutes a crime against humanity and has directly led to more than 600,000 internally displaced people living within Burma and more than 130,000 people from Burma living in refugee camps along the Thai-Burma border.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The ethnic cleansing campaign of the SPDC is in sharp contrast to the traditional peaceful coexistence in Burma of Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, and people of traditional beliefs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The SPDC has demonstrably failed to cooperate with the United States in stopping the flood of heroin and methamphetamines being grown, refined, manufactured, and transported in areas under the control of the SPDC serving to flood the region and much of the world with these illicit drugs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The SPDC provides safety, security, and engages in business dealings with narcotics traffickers under indictment by United States authorities, and other producers and traffickers of narcotics.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) The International Labor Organization (ILO), for the first time in its 82-year history, adopted in 2000, a resolution recommending that governments, employers, and workers organizations take appropriate measures to ensure that their relations with the SPDC do not abet the government-sponsored system of forced, compulsory, or slave labor in Burma, and that other international bodies reconsider any cooperation they may be engaged in with Burma and, if appropriate, cease as soon as possible any activity that could abet the practice of forced, compulsory, or slave labor.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) The SPDC has integrated the Burmese military and its surrogates into all facets of the economy effectively destroying any free enterprise system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Investment in Burmese companies and purchases from them serve to provide the SPDC with <!-- PDFPage:292 -->currency that is used to finance its instruments of terror and repression against the Burmese people.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) On April 15, 2003, the American Apparel and Footwear Association expressed its &lsquo;strong support for a full and immediate ban on U.S. textiles, apparel and footwear imports from Burma&rsquo; and called upon the United States Government to &lsquo;impose an outright ban on U.S. imports&rsquo; of these items until Burma demonstrates respect for basic human and labor rights of its citizens.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) The policy of the United States, as articulated by the President on April 24, 2003, is to officially recognize the NLD as the legitimate representative of the Burmese people as determined by the 1990 election.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) The United States must work closely with other nations, including Thailand, a close ally of the United States, to highlight attention to the SPDC's systematic abuses of human rights in Burma, to ensure that nongovernmental organizations promoting human rights and political freedom in Burma are allowed to operate freely and without harassment, and to craft a multilateral sanctions regime against Burma in order to pressure the SPDC to meet the conditions identified in section 3(a)(3) of this Act.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. BAN AGAINST TRADE THAT SUPPORTS THE MILITARY REGIME OF BURMA.</h4>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) Pursuant to section 706(2) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107&ndash;228) [22 U.S.C. 2291j&ndash;1(2)], Burma has not been designated as a country that has failed demonstrably to make substantial efforts to adhere to its obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and to take other effective counternarcotics measures, including, but not limited to (i) the arrest and extradition of all individuals under indictment in the United States for narcotics trafficking, (ii) concrete and measurable actions to stem the flow of illicit drug money into Burma's banking system and economic enterprises, and (iii) actions to stop the manufacture and export of methamphetamines.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) A comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan, as envisioned in the Sudan Peace Act [Pub. L. 107&ndash;245] (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) and the Machakos Protocol of 2002, could be in jeopardy if the parties do not implement and honor the agreements they have signed.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Since seizing power through a military coup in 1989, the Government of Sudan repeatedly has attacked and dislocated civilian populations in southern Sudan in a coordinated policy of ethnic cleansing and genocide that has cost the lives of more than 2,000,000 people and displaced more than 4,000,000 people.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In response to two decades of civil conflict in Sudan, the United States has helped to establish an internationally supported peace process to promote a negotiated settlement to the war that has resulted in a framework peace agreement, the Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan, signed on June 5, 2004.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) At the same time that the Government of Sudan was negotiating for a comprehensive and all inclusive peace agreement, enumerated in the Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan, it refused to engage in any meaningful discussion with regard to its ongoing campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide in the Darfur region of western Sudan.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The Government of Sudan reluctantly agreed to attend talks to bring peace to the Darfur region only after considerable international pressure and outrage was expressed through high level visits by Secretary of State Colin Powell and others, and through United Nations Security Council Resolution 1556 (July 30, 2004).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The Government of the United States, in both the executive branch and Congress, has concluded that genocide has been committed and may still be occurring in the Darfur region, and that the Government of Sudan and militias supported by the Government of Sudan, known as the Janjaweed, bear responsibility for the genocide.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Evidence collected by international observers in the Darfur region between February 2003 and November 2004 indicate a coordinated effort to target African Sudanese civilians in a scorched earth policy, similar to that which was employed in southern Sudan, that has destroyed African Sudanese villages, killing and driving away their people, while Arab Sudanese villages have been left unscathed.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) As a result of this genocidal policy in the Darfur region, an estimated 70,000 people have died, more than 1,600,000 people have been internally displaced, and more than 200,000 people have been forced to flee to neighboring Chad.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Reports further indicate the systematic rape of thousands of women and girls, the abduction of women and children, and the destruction of hundreds of ethnically African villages, including the poisoning of their wells and the plunder of their crops and cattle upon which the people of such villages sustain themselves.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Despite the threat of international action expressed through United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1556 (July 30, 2004) and 1564 (September 18, 2004), the Government of Sudan continues to obstruct and prevent efforts to reverse the catastrophic consequences that loom over the Darfur region.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) In addition to the thousands of violent deaths directly caused by ongoing Sudanese military and government-sponsored Janjaweed attacks in the Darfur region, the Government of Sudan has restricted access by humanitarian and human rights workers to the Darfur area through intimidation by military and security forces, and through bureaucratic and administrative obstruction, in an attempt to inflict the most devastating harm on those individuals displaced from their villages and homes without any means of sustenance or shelter.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) The Government of Sudan's continued support for the Janjaweed and their obstruction of the delivery of food, shelter, and medical care to the Darfur region is estimated by the World Health Organization to be causing up to 10,000 deaths per month and, should current conditions persist, is projected to escalate to thousands of deaths each day by December 2004.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) The Government of Chad served an important role in facilitating the humanitarian cease-fire (the N'Djamena Agreement dated April 8, 2004) for the Darfur region between the Government of Sudan and the two opposition rebel groups in the Darfur region (the JEM and the SLA), although both sides have violated the cease-fire agreement repeatedly.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) The people of Chad have responded courageously to the plight of over 200,000 Darfur refugees by providing assistance to them even though such assistance has adversely affected their own means of livelihood.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) On September 9, 2004, Secretary of State Colin Powell stated before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate: &lsquo;When we reviewed the evidence compiled by our team, along with other information available to the State Department, we concluded that genocide has been committed in Darfur and that the Government of Sudan and the [Janjaweed] bear responsibility&mdash;and genocide may still be occurring.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) The African Union has demonstrated renewed vigor in regional affairs through its willingness to respond to the crisis in the Darfur region, by convening talks between the parties and deploying several hundred monitors and security forces to the region, as well as by recognizing the need for a far larger force with a broader mandate.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) The Government of Sudan's complicity in the atrocities and genocide in the Darfur region raises fundamental questions about the Government of Sudan's commitment to peace and stability in Sudan.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE CONFLICT IN DARFUR, SUDAN.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Sudan Peace Act</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that the Sudan Peace Act [Pub. L. 107&ndash;245] (50 U.S.C. <!-- PDFPage:295 -->1701 note) remains relevant and should be extended to include the Darfur region of Sudan.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Actions To Address the Conflict</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) a legitimate countrywide peace in Sudan will only be possible if those principles enumerated in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that are affirmed in the Machakos Protocol of 2002 and the Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan signed on June 5, 2004, are applied to all of Sudan, including the Darfur region;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the parties to the N'Djamena Agreement (the Government of Sudan, the JEM, and the SLA) must meet their obligations under that Agreement to allow safe and immediate delivery of all humanitarian assistance throughout the Darfur region and must expedite the conclusion of a political agreement to end the genocide and conflict in the Darfur region;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the United States should continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the areas of Sudan to which the United States has access and, at the same time, implement a plan to provide assistance to the areas of Sudan to which access has been obstructed or denied;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the international community, including African, Arab, and Muslim nations, should immediately provide resources necessary to save the lives of hundreds of thousands of individuals at risk as a result of the crisis in the Darfur region;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the United States and the international community should&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) provide all necessary assistance to deploy and sustain an African Union Force to the Darfur region; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) work to increase the authorized level and expand the mandate of such forces commensurate with the gravity and scope of the problem in a region the size of France;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the President, acting through the Secretary of State and the Permanent Representative of the United States to the United Nations, should&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) condemn any failure on the part of the Government of Sudan to fulfill its obligations under United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1556 (July 30, 2004) and 1564 (September 18, 2004), and press the United Nations Security Council to respond to such failure by immediately imposing the penalties suggested in paragraph (14) of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1564;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) press the United Nations Security Council to pursue accountability for those individuals who are found responsible for orchestrating and carrying out the atrocities in the Darfur region, consistent with relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) encourage member states of the United Nations to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(i) cease to import Sudanese oil; and</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(ii) take the following actions against Sudanese Government and military officials and other individuals, who are planning, carrying out, or otherwise involved in the policy of genocide in the Darfur region, as well as their families, and businesses controlled by the Government of Sudan and the National Congress Party:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;(I) freeze the assets held by such individuals or businesses in each such member state; and</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;(II) restrict the entry or transit of such officials through each such member state;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the President should impose targeted sanctions, including a ban on travel and the freezing of assets, on those officials of the Government of Sudan, including military officials, and other individuals who have planned or carried out, or otherwise been involved in the policy of genocide in the Darfur region, and should also freeze the assets of businesses controlled by the Government of Sudan or the National Congress Party;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) the Government of the United States should not normalize relations with Sudan, including through the lifting of any sanctions, until the Government of Sudan agrees to, and takes demonstrable steps to implement, peace agreements for all areas of Sudan, including the Darfur region;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) those individuals found to be involved in the planning or carrying out of genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity should not hold leadership positions in the Government of Sudan or the coalition government established pursuant to the agreements reached in the Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) the Government of Sudan has a primary responsibility to guarantee the safety and welfare of its citizens, which includes allowing them access to humanitarian assistance and providing them protection from violence.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Sudan Peace Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The Government of Sudan has intensified its prosecution of the war against areas outside of its control, which has already cost more than 2,000,000 lives and has displaced more than 4,000,000 people.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) A viable, comprehensive, and internationally sponsored peace process, protected from manipulation, presents the best chance for a permanent resolution of the war, protection of human rights, and a self-sustaining Sudan.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Continued strengthening and reform of humanitarian relief operations in Sudan is an essential element in the effort to bring an end to the war.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Continued leadership by the United States is critical.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Regardless of the future political status of the areas of Sudan outside of the control of the Government of Sudan, the absence of credible civil authority and institutions is a major impediment to achieving self-sustenance by the Sudanese people and to meaningful progress toward a viable peace process. It is critical that credible civil authority and institutions play an important role in the reconstruction of post-war Sudan.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Through the manipulation of traditional rivalries among peoples in areas outside of its full control, the Government of Sudan has used divide-and-conquer techniques effectively to subjugate its population. However, internationally sponsored reconciliation efforts have played a critical role in reducing human suffering and the effectiveness of this tactic.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The Government of Sudan utilizes and organizes militias, Popular Defense Forces, and other irregular units for raiding and enslaving parties in areas outside of the control of the Government of Sudan in an effort to disrupt severely the ability of the populations in those areas to sustain themselves. The tactic helps minimize the Government of Sudan's accountability internationally.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The Government of Sudan has repeatedly stated that it intends to use the expected proceeds from future oil sales to increase the tempo and lethality of the war against the areas outside of its control.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) By regularly banning air transport relief flights by the United Nations relief operation OLS, the Government of Sudan has been able to manipulate the receipt of food aid by the Sudanese people from the United States and other donor countries as a devastating weapon of war in the ongoing effort by the Government of Sudan to starve targeted groups and subdue areas of Sudan outside of the Government's control.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) The acts of the Government of Sudan, including the acts described in this section, constitute genocide as defined by the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (78 U.N.T.S. 277).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) The efforts of the United States and other donors in delivering relief and assistance through means outside of OLS have played a critical role in addressing the deficiencies in OLS and offset the Government of Sudan's manipulation of food donations to advantage in the civil war in Sudan.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) While the immediate needs of selected areas in Sudan facing starvation have been addressed in the near term, the population in areas of Sudan outside of the control of the Government of Sudan are still in danger of extreme disruption of their ability to sustain themselves.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) The Nuba Mountains and many areas in Bahr al Ghazal and the Upper Nile and the Blue Nile regions have been excluded completely from relief distribution by OLS, consequently placing their populations at increased risk of famine.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) At a cost which has sometimes exceeded $1,000,000 per day, and with a primary focus on providing only for the immediate food needs of the recipients, the current international relief operations are neither sustainable nor desirable in the long term.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) The ability of populations to defend themselves against attack in areas outside of the control of the Government of Sudan has been severely compromised by the disengagement of the front-line states of Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Uganda, fostering the belief among officials of the Government of Sudan that success on the battlefield can be achieved.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) The United States should use all means of pressure available to facilitate a comprehensive solution to the war in Sudan, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the multilateralization of economic and diplomatic tools to compel the Government of Sudan to enter into a good faith peace process;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) the support or creation of viable democratic civil authority and institutions in areas of Sudan outside of government control;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) continued active support of people-to-people reconciliation mechanisms and efforts in areas outside of government control;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) the strengthening of the mechanisms to provide humanitarian relief to those areas; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) cooperation among the trading partners of the United States and within multilateral institutions toward those ends.</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) the ongoing slave trade in Sudan and the role of the Government of Sudan in abetting and tolerating the practice;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) the Government of Sudan's use and organization of &lsquo;murahalliin&rsquo; or &lsquo;mujahadeen&rsquo;, Popular Defense Forces, and regular Sudanese Army units into organized and coordinated raiding and slaving parties in Bahr al Ghazal, the Nuba Mountains, and the Upper Nile and the Blue Nile regions; and</p>
