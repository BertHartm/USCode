<p class="note-body">Notice of President of the United States, dated Oct. 31, 1994, 59 F.R. 54785, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">On November 14, 1979, by Executive Order No. 12170 [set out above], the President declared a national emergency to deal with the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the situation in Iran. Notices of the continuation of this national emergency have been transmitted annually by the President to the Congress and the Federal Register. The most recent notice appeared in the Federal Register on November 2, 1993. Because our relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal, and the process of implementing the January 19, 1981, agreements with Iran is still underway, the national emergency declared on November 14, 1979, must continue in effect beyond November 14, 1994. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to Iran. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.</p>

<p class="note-body">On January 7, 1986, by Executive Order No. 12543 [set out above], President Reagan declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Libya. On January 8, 1986, by Executive Order No. 12544 [set out below], the President took additional measures to block Libyan assets in the United States. The President has transmitted a notice continuing this emergency to the Congress and the Federal Register every year since 1986.</p>
<p class="note-body">The crisis between the United States and Libya that led to the declaration of a national emergency on January 7, 1986, has not been resolved. The Government of Libya has continued its actions and policies in support of terrorism, despite the calls by the United Nations Security Council, in Resolutions 731 (1992), 748 (1992), and 883 (1993) that it demonstrate by concrete actions its renunciation of such terrorism. Such Libyan actions and policies pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and vital foreign policy interest of the United States. For these reasons, the national emergency declared on January 7, 1986, and the measures adopted on January 7 and January 8, 1986, to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond January 7, 1995. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to Libya. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.</p>

<p class="note-body">On August 2, 1990, by Executive Order No. 12722 [set out above], President Bush declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Iraq. By Executive Orders Nos. 12722 of August 2, 1990, and 12724 of August 9, 1990 [set out below], President Bush imposed trade sanctions on Iraq and blocked Iraqi government assets. Because the Government of Iraq has continued its activities hostile to United States interests in the Middle East, the national emergency declared on August 2, 1990, and the measures adopted on August 2 and August 9, 1990, to deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond August 2, 1994. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to Iraq.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Continuation of National Emergency Declared by Ex. Ord. No. 12808</h4>
<p class="note-body">Notice of President of the United States, dated May 25, 1994, 59 F.R. 27429, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">On May 30, 1992, by Executive Order No. 12808 [set out above], President Bush declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro, blocking all property and interests in property of those Governments. The President took additional measures to prohibit trade and other transactions with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) by Executive Orders Nos. 12810, 12831, and 12846 [set out below], issued on June 5, 1992, January 15, 1993, and April 25, 1993, respectively. Because the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) has continued its actions and policies in support of groups seizing and attempting to seize territory in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina by force and violence, the national emergency declared on May 30, 1992, and the measures adopted pursuant thereto to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond May 30, 1994. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).</p>

<p class="note-body">On September 26, 1993, by Executive Order No. 12865 [set out above], I declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (&ldquo;UNITA&rdquo;), prohibiting the sale or supply by United States persons or from the United States, or using U.S. registered vessels or aircraft, of arms and related material of all types, and petroleum and petroleum products to the territory of Angola, other than through designated points of entry. The order also prohibits the sale or supply of such commodities to UNITA. Because of our continuing international obligations and because of the prejudicial effect that discontinuation of the sanctions would have on the Angolan peace process, the national emergency declared on September 26, 1993, and the measures adopted pursuant thereto to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond September 26, 1994. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to UNITA.</p>

<p class="note-body">I, WILLIAM J.

<p class="note-body">(b) Subsection (a) of this section will not apply to exports relating to a particular category of weapons of mass destruction (i.e., nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons) if their destination is a country with whose government the United States has entered into a bilateral or multilateral arrangement for the control of that category of weapons of mass destruction-related goods (including delivery systems) and technology, or maintains domestic export controls comparable to controls that are imposed by the United States with respect to that category of goods and technology, or that are otherwise deemed adequate by the Secretary of State.</p>
