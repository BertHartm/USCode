<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Apr. 21, 2005, 70 F.R. 23925, provided:</p>

<p class="note-body-block-1em">(a) IN GENERAL- Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, this title and the amendments made by this title shall take effect not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of this Act.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection 1097(a) clearly contemplates that one or more of the provisions in Title I of the Act may take effect earlier than the date that is 6 months after the date of enactment of the Act, but does not state explicitly the mechanism for determining when such earlier effect shall occur, leaving it to the President in the execution of the Act. Moreover, given that section 1097(a) evinces a legislative intent to afford the President flexibility, and such flexibility is constitutionally appropriate with respect to intelligence matters (see <em>United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corporation</em>, 299 U.S. 304 (1936)), the executive branch shall construe section 1097(a) to authorize the President to select different effective dates that precede the 6-month deadline for different provisions in Title I.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, pursuant to the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including subsection 1097(a) of the Act, I hereby determine and direct:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. Sections 1097(a) and 1103 of the Act [set out in notes above], relating respectively to effective dates of provisions and to severability, shall take effect immediately upon the signing of this memorandum to any extent that they have not already taken effect.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Provisions in Title I of the Act other than those addressed in numbered paragraph 1 of this memorandum shall take effect immediately upon the signing of this memorandum, except:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) any provision in Title I of the Act for which the Act expressly provides the date on which the provision shall take effect; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) sections 1021 and 1092 of the Act [enacting section 404<em>o</em> of this title and provisions set out in a note above, respectively], relating to the National Counterterrorism Center.</p>
<p class="note-body">The taking of effect of a provision pursuant to section 1097(a) of the Act and this memorandum shall not affect the construction of such provision by the executive branch as set forth in my Statement of December 17, 2004, upon signing the Act into law.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is intelligence that is produced from publicly available information and is collected, exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience for the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence requirement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) With the Information Revolution, the amount, significance, and accessibility of open-source information has expanded significantly, but the intelligence community has not expanded its exploitation efforts and systems to produce open-source intelligence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The production of open-source intelligence is a valuable intelligence discipline that must be integrated into intelligence tasking, collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination to ensure that United States policymakers are fully and completely informed.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The dissemination and use of validated open-source intelligence inherently enables information sharing since open-source intelligence is produced without the use of sensitive sources and methods. Open-source intelligence products can be shared with the American public and foreign allies because of the unclassified nature of open-source intelligence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (popularly referred to as the &lsquo;9/11 Commission&rsquo;), in its final report released on July 22, 2004, identified shortfalls in the ability of the United States to use all-source intelligence, a large component of which is open-source intelligence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law 108&ndash;458) [see Tables for classification], Congress calls for coordination of the collection, analysis, production, and dissemination of open-source intelligence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction, in its report to the President released on March 31, 2005, found that &lsquo;the need for exploiting open-source material is greater now than ever be<!-- PDFPage:104 -->fore,&rsquo; but that &lsquo;the Intelligence Community's open source programs have not expanded commensurate with either the increase in available information or with the growing importance of open source data to today's problems&rsquo;.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;Director&rdquo; means the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#403x_1_target" name="403x_1">1</a></sup></p>

An employee who receives separation pay under this section on the basis of a separation occurring on or after March 30, 1994, and accepts employment with the Government of the United States within 5 years after the date of the separation on which payment of the separation pay is based shall be required to repay the entire amount of the separation pay to the Central Intelligence Agency. If the employment is with an Executive agency (as defined by section 105 of title 5), the Director of the Office of Personnel Management may, at the request of the head of the agency, waive the repayment if the individual involved possesses unique abilities and is the only qualified applicant available for the position. If the employment is with an entity in the legislative branch, the head of the entity or the appointing official may waive the repayment if the individual involved possesses unique abilities and is the only qualified applicant available for the position.

I74Section 1. Functions of Chairman and of Board<p class="note-body">The functions of the National Security Resources Board are hereby transferred to the Chairman of the National Security Resources Board, and the Board shall hereafter advise and consult with the Chairman with respect to such matters within his jurisdiction as he may request.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Sec. 2. Vice Chairman</h4>
<p class="note-body">There is hereby established the office of Vice Chairman of the National Security Resources Board. Such Vice Chairman shall (1) be an additional member of the National Security Resources Board, (2) be appointed from civilian life by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, (3) receive compensation at the rate of $16,000 per annum, and (4) perform such of the duties of the Chairman as the Chairman shall designate.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Sec. 3. Performance of Functions of Chairman</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Chairman may from time to time make such provisions as he shall deem appropriate authorizing the performance by any other officer, or by any agency or employee, of the National Security Resources Board of any function of the Chairman.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 25 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. The plan transfers the function of the National Security Resources Board from the Board to the Chairman of the Board and makes the Board advisory to the Chairman. The plan also provides for a Vice Chairman, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p class="note-body">The function assigned to the National Security Resources Board by the National Security Act of 1947 is &ldquo;to advise the President concerning the coordination of military, industrial and civilian mobilization.&rdquo; Proper performance of this function requires action by the Board and its staff in two broad areas:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) The conduct of advance mobilization planning which identifies the problems which will arise and the measures necessary to meet these problems if and when the Nation moves from a peacetime into a wartime situation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The formulation of current policies and programs which will help the Nation achieve an adequate state of readiness against the eventuality of a future war.</p>
<p class="note-body">The role assigned the National Security Resources Board is clearly one of staff assistance to the President. The Congress recently recognized this fact in its approval of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1949 which, pursuant to the specific recommendation of the Hoover Commission, placed the National Security Resources Board in the Executive Office of the President.</p>
<p class="note-body">The accompanying reorganization plan is designed to make the National Security Resources Board a more effective instrument. Successful performance of the Board's mission requires a wide range of detailed study and analysis to cover all the major aspects of national mobilization. A committee of department heads or departmental representatives encounters some natural difficulties in providing supervision and leadership in such an extensive and detailed activity. The Chairman has the difficult task of exercising discretion as to which matters shall be submitted for Board approval. The departmental members of the Board cannot possibly supervise or approve the Board's extensive and detailed activities and yet, as Board members, must accept ultimate responsibility for all such activities. Likewise, the departmental members are encumbered by the difficulty of having to reach collective and speedy decisions on a great many matters for which they, as Board members, are responsible.</p>
<p class="note-body">By vesting the functions of the Board in the Chairman, the difficulties of Board operation will be overcome. At the same time, the reorganization plan provides for the continued participation of the several departments and agencies in the task of mobilization planning. This is not only a matter of established policy but also a requirement of the National Security Act. The departments will continue to have representation on the Board. The Board, in an advisory relationship to the Chairman, will be a useful arrangement for obtaining the necessary participation of departments in mobilization planning and for coordination of their activity. It will enable the departments to keep abreast of the total range of security resources planning. Without reliance on the departments for the execution of much of the actual job of mobilization planning, coordination with the total range of governmental policies and objectives would be lost.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Congress in passing the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 recognized the difficulty which exists when functions of staff advice and assistance are placed in a board-type agency. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949, in clarifying the role of the Chairman of the Munitions Board and the Research and Development Board, strengthened and increased the effectiveness of these staff agencies of the Secretary of Defense by providing for the exclusive exercise of responsibilities by the Chairman. This plan achieves the same objective for the National Security Resources Board.</p>
<p class="note-body">The accompanying reorganization plan provides for a Vice Chairman appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The tremendous responsibilities of the National Security Resources Board and the heavy workload on the Chairman fully warrant this. Providing the Chairman with a principal associate for the exercise of his responsibilities is consistent with the usual practice in other agencies of the executive branch.</p>
<p class="note-body">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 25 of 1950 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body">I have found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying reorganization plan, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of a Vice Chairman of the National Security Resources Board. The rate of compensation fixed for this officer is that which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">The taking effect of the reorganizations included in Reorganization Plan No. 25 may not in itself result in <!-- PDFPage:137 -->substantial immediate savings. However, the important objective is maximum effectiveness in security resources planning.</p>
<p class="note-body">The security of this Nation requires that these steps be taken to enable security resources planning to move forward more effectively. It is for that reason that Reorganization Plan No. 25 is today submitted to the Congress. It is for that reason, and that reason alone, that I strongly urge congressional acceptance of Reorganization Plan No. 25.</p>

<p class="note-body">[For subsequent history relating to Office of Defense Mobilization, see notes set out under this section.]</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1953, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganization plan is designed to achieve two primary objectives: The first is to improve the organi<!-- PDFPage:138 -->zation of the Executive Office of the President; the second is to enable one Executive Office agency to exercise strong leadership in our national mobilization effort, including both current defense activities and readiness for any future national emergency.</p>
<p class="note-body">The National Security Resources Board was established by the National Security Act of 1947 to advise the President concerning various aspects of future military, industrial, and civilian mobilization. The areas of responsibility assigned to the Board included the use of national and industrial resources for military and civilian needs; the sufficiency of productive facilities; the strategic relocation of industries; the mobilization and maximum utilization of manpower; and the maintenance and stabilization of the civilian economy.</p>
<p class="note-body">The vigorous and efficient discharge of these vital functions is not well served by the simultaneous existence in the Executive Office of the President of the National Security Resources Board (charged with planning for the future) and the present Office of Defense Mobilization (charged with programs of the present). The progress of the current mobilization effort has made plain how artificial is the present separation of these functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Both functions should now be combined into one defense mobilization agency. Accordingly, the reorganization plan would create in the Executive Office of the President a new agency, to be known as the Office of Defense Mobilization. It would transfer to the new Office the functions of the Chairman of the National Security Resources Board and abolish that Board, including the offices of Chairman and Vice Chairman.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganization plan also transfers to the new agency the statutory functions of the present Office of Defense Mobilization. These are of a minor nature, the major functions of the present Office of Defense Mobilization having been delegated to it by the President, principally under the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended. It is my intention to transfer the latter functions to the new agency by Executive order, and to abolish the Office of Defense Mobilization established by Executive Order No. 10193. There will thus result a new agency which combines the activities of the National Security Resources Board and both the statutory and delegated functions of the heretofore existing Office of Defense Mobilization.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposed plan would also reorganize various activities relating to the stockpiling of strategic and critical materials. Those activities are principally provided for in the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, as amended. It has become increasingly apparent that the policy and program aspects of stockpiling are an integral part of mobilization planning. They should not be administered separately from plant expansion, conservation of materials, and materials procurement under the Defense Production Act of 1950, or from the duties placed in the National Security Resources Board by the National Security Act of 1947. Therefore, the reorganization plan would transfer to the Director of the new Office of Defense Mobilization responsibility for major stockpiling actions, including the determination of the nature and quantities of materials to be stockpiled. In the main, these functions are transferred from the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force (acting jointly through the agency of the Munitions Board) and the Secretary of the Interior. The duties of the Administrator of General Services regarding the purchase of strategic and critical materials and the management of stockpiles are not affected by the reorganization plan, except that he will receive his directions, under the plan, from the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization instead of from the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="note-body">This transfer of stockpiling functions will correct the present undesirable confusion of responsibilities. The functions of the heads of the military departments of the Department of Defense and the Secretary of the Interior under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, as amended, are at present in considerable measure subject to other authority of delegates of the President springing from the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended. The allocation and distribution of scarce materials among essential civilian and military activities and the continued maintenance of adequate stockpiles of strategic and critical materials are of major current importance. The reorganization plan will make possible more effective coordination and close control over the Government's whole stockpile program. It will speed decisions. It can result in significant economies.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Department of Defense will, of course, continue to be responsible for presenting the needs of the military services. That Department and the Department of the Interior are specifically designated in the plan as additional agencies which shall appoint representatives to cooperate with the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization in determining which materials are strategic and critical and how much of them is to be purchased. Final authority with regard to such determination will, however, be in the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 5(a) of the reorganization plan withholds from transfer to the Director and abolishes the functions of the Chairman of the National Security Resources Board with regard to being consulted by and furnishing advice to the President concerning the placing of orders of mandatory precedence for articles or materials for the use of the armed forces of the United States or for the use of the Atomic Energy Commission, and with regard to determining that a plant, mine, or other facility can be readily converted to the production or furnishing of such articles or materials. These abolished functions were vested in the National Security Resources Board by section 18 of the Selective Service Act of 1948 (later renamed as the Universal Military Training and Service Act) and were transferred to the Chairman of that Board by Reorganization Plan No. 25 of 1950. The practical effect of this abolition is to obviate a statutory mandate that the President consult and advise with another officer of the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 5(b) of the reorganization plan abolishes the direction, authority, and control of the Secretary of Defense over functions transferred from the Department of Defense by the reorganization plan. The Secretary's functions in this regard are provided for in section 202(b) of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (5 U.S.C. 171a(b)) [see 10 U.S.C. 113(b)].</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 5(c) of the reorganization plan abolishes any functions which were vested in the Army and Navy Munitions Board or which are vested in the Munitions Board with respect to serving as the agent through which the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Interior jointly act in determining which materials are strategic and critical under the provisions of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, as amended, and the quality and quantities of such materials to be stockpiled. These abolished functions are provided for in section 2(a) of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, as amended.</p>
<p class="note-body">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1953 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended. I have also found and hereby declare that by reason of these reorganizations it is necessary to include in the reorganization plan provisions for the appointment and compensation of a Director and a Deputy Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are, respectively, those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers of the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganization plan will permit better organization and management of the Federal programs relating to materials and requirements and will thus help to achieve the maximum degree of mobilization readiness at the least possible cost. It is not practicable, however, to itemize, in advance of actual experience, the <!-- PDFPage:139 -->reductions of expenditures to be brought about by the taking effect of the reorganizations included in Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1953.</p>
<p class="note-body">I urge that the Congress allow the proposed reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Independent cost estimates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Director of National Intelligence shall, in consultation with the head of each element of the intelligence community concerned, prepare an independent cost estimate of the full life-cycle cost of development, procurement, and operation of each major system to be acquired by the intelligence community.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each independent cost estimate for a major system shall, to the maximum extent practicable, specify the amount required to be appropriated and obligated to develop, procure, and operate the major system in each fiscal year of the proposed period of development, procurement, and operation of the major system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In the case of a program of the intelligence community that qualifies as a major system, an independent cost estimate shall be prepared before the submission to Congress of the budget of the President for the first fiscal year in which appropriated funds are anticipated to be obligated for the development or procurement of such major system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a program of the intelligence community for which an independent cost estimate was not previously required to be prepared under this section, including a program for which development or procurement commenced before December 13, 2003, if the aggregate future costs of development or procurement (or any combination of such activities) of the program will exceed $500,000,000 (in current fiscal year dollars), the program shall qualify as a major system for purposes of this section, and an independent cost estimate for such major system shall be prepared before the submission to Congress of the budget of the President for the first fiscal year thereafter in which appropriated funds are anticipated to be obligated for such major system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The independent cost estimate for a major system shall be updated upon&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the completion of any preliminary design review associated with the major system;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:166 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any significant modification to the anticipated design of the major system; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any change in circumstances that renders the current independent cost estimate for the major system inaccurate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Any update of an independent cost estimate for a major system under paragraph (4) shall meet all requirements for independent cost estimates under this section, and shall be treated as the most current independent cost estimate for the major system until further updated under that paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Preparation of independent cost estimates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Director shall establish within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence for Community Management an office which shall be responsible for preparing independent cost estimates, and any updates thereof, under subsection (a) of this section, unless a designation is made under paragraph (2).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Utilization in budgets of President</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the budget of the President requests appropriations for any fiscal year for the development or procurement of a major system by the intelligence community, the President shall, subject to paragraph (2), request in such budget an amount of appropriations for the development or procurement, as the case may be, of the major system that is equivalent to the amount of appropriations identified in the most current independent cost estimate for the major system for obligation for each fiscal year for which appropriations are requested for the major system in such budget.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the amount of appropriations requested in the budget of the President for the development or procurement of a major system is less than the amount of appropriations identified in the most current independent cost estimate for the major system for obligation for each fiscal year for which appropriations are requested for the major system in such budget, the President shall include in the budget justification materials submitted to Congress in support of such budget&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an explanation for the difference between the amount of appropriations requested and the amount of appropriations identified in the most current independent cost estimate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a description of the importance of the major system to the national security;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) an assessment of the consequences for the funding of all programs of the National Foreign Intelligence Program in future fiscal years if the most current independent cost estimate for the major system is accurate and additional appropriations are required in future fiscal years to ensure the continued development or procurement of the major system, including the consequences of such funding shortfalls on the major system and all other programs of the National Foreign Intelligence Program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) such other information on the funding of the major system as the President considers appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Inclusion of estimates in budget justification materials</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The budget justification materials submitted to Congress in support of the budget of the President shall include the most current independent cost estimate under this section for each major system for which appropriations are requested in such budget for any fiscal year.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) While some increases in the costs of acquisition of major systems by the intelligence community are unavoidable, the magnitude of growth in the costs of acquisition of many major systems indicates a systemic bias within the intelligence community to underestimate the costs of such acquisition, particularly in the preliminary stages of development and production.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Decisions by Congress to fund the acquisition of major systems by the intelligence community rely significantly upon initial estimates of the affordability of acquiring such major systems and occur within a context in which funds can be allocated for a variety of alternative programs. Thus, substantial increases in costs of acquisition of major systems place significant burdens on the availability of funds for other programs and new proposals within the National Foreign Intelligence Program.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Independent cost estimates, prepared by independent offices, have historically represented a more accurate projection of the costs of acquisition of major systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Recognizing the benefits associated with independent cost estimates for the acquisition of major systems, the Secretary of Defense has built upon the statutory requirement in section 2434 of title 10, United States Code, to develop and consider independent cost estimates for the acquisition of such systems by mandating the use of such estimates in budget requests of the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The mandatory use throughout the intelligence community of independent cost estimates for the acquisition of major systems will assist the President and Congress in the development and funding of budgets which more accurately reflect the requirements and priorities of the United States Government for intelligence and intelligence-related activities.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) The court may not order NGA to review the content of any exempted operational file or files in order to make the demonstration required under subclause (I), unless the complainant disputes NGA's showing with a sworn written submission based on personal knowledge or otherwise admissible evidence.</p>

The Director of National Intelligence must approve any determination to remove such exemptions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The review required by paragraph (1) shall include consideration of the historical value or other public interest in the subject matter of the particular category of files or portions thereof and the potential for declassifying a significant part of the information contained therein.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 901. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This title may be cited as the &lsquo;Protection and Reduction of Government Secrecy Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 902. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) During the Cold War an extensive secrecy system developed which limited public access to information and reduced the ability of the public to participate with full knowledge in the process of governmental decisionmaking.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In 1992 alone 6,349,532 documents were classified and approximately three million persons held some form of security clearance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The burden of managing more than 6 million newly classified documents every year has led to tremendous administrative expense, reduced communication within the government and within the scientific community, reduced communication between the government and the people of the United States, and the selective and unauthorized public disclosure of classified information.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) It has been estimated that private businesses spend more than $14 billion each year implementing government mandated regulations for protecting classified information.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) If a smaller amount of truly sensitive information were classified the information could be held more securely.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In 1970 a Task Force organized by the Defense Science Board and headed by Dr. Frederick Seitz concluded that &lsquo;more might be gained than lost if our Nation were to adopt&mdash;unilaterally, if necessary&mdash;a policy of complete openness in all areas of information&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The procedures for granting security clearances have themselves become an expensive and inefficient part of the secrecy system and should be closely examined.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) A bipartisan study commission specially constituted for the purpose of examining the consequences of the secrecy system will be able to offer comprehensive proposals for reform.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 903. PURPOSE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the purpose of this title to establish for a two-year period a Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to examine the implications of the extensive classification of information and to make recommendations to reduce the volume of information classified and thereby to strengthen the protection of legitimately classified information; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to examine and make recommendations concerning current procedures relating to the granting of security clearances.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 904. COMPOSITION OF THE COMMISSION.</h4>

<p class="note-body">This order prescribes a uniform system for classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying national security information, including information relating to defense against transnational terrorism. Our democratic principles require that the American people be informed of the activities of their Government. Also, our Nation's progress depends on the free flow of information. Nevertheless, throughout our history, the national defense has required that certain information be maintained in confidence in order to protect our citizens, our democratic institutions, our homeland security, and our interactions with foreign nations. Protecting information critical to our Nation's security remains a priority.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>

<!-- field-start:analysis -->
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 1&mdash;ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 1.1. <em>Classification Standards</em>. (a) Information may be originally classified under the terms of this order only if all of the following conditions are met:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) an original classification authority is classifying the information;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) the information is owned by, produced by or for, or is under the control of the United States Government;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) the information falls within one or more of the categories of information listed in section 1.4 of this order; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) the original classification authority determines that the unauthorized disclosure of the information reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security, which includes defense against transnational terrorism, and the original classification authority is able to identify or describe the damage.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Classified information shall not be declassified automatically as a result of any unauthorized disclosure of identical or similar information.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The unauthorized disclosure of foreign government information is presumed to cause damage to the national security.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 1.2. <em>Classification Levels</em>. (a) Information may be classified at one of the following three levels:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) &ldquo;Top Secret&rdquo; shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) &ldquo;Secret&rdquo; shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:196 --><p class="note-body">(3) &ldquo;Confidential&rdquo; shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Except as otherwise provided by statute, no other terms shall be used to identify United States classified information.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 1.3. <em>Classification Authority</em>. (a) The authority to classify information originally may be exercised only by:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) the President and, in the performance of executive duties, the Vice President;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) agency heads and officials designated by the President in the Federal Register; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) United States Government officials delegated this authority pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Officials authorized to classify information at a specified level are also authorized to classify information at a lower level.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Delegation of original classification authority.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Delegations of original classification authority shall be limited to the minimum required to administer this order. Agency heads are responsible for ensuring that designated subordinate officials have a demonstrable and continuing need to exercise this authority.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) &ldquo;Top Secret&rdquo; original classification authority may be delegated only by the President; in the performance of executive duties, the Vice President; or an agency head or official designated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) &ldquo;Secret&rdquo; or &ldquo;Confidential&rdquo; original classification authority may be delegated only by the President; in the performance of executive duties, the Vice President; or an agency head or official designated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section; or the senior agency official described in section 5.4(d) of this order, provided that official has been delegated &ldquo;Top Secret&rdquo; original classification authority by the agency head.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) Each delegation of original classification authority shall be in writing and the authority shall not be redelegated except as provided in this order. Each delegation shall identify the official by name or position title.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Original classification authorities must receive training in original classification as provided in this order and its implementing directives. Such training must include instruction on the proper safeguarding of classified information and of the criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions that may be brought against an individual who fails to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Exceptional cases. When an employee, government contractor, licensee, certificate holder, or grantee of an agency who does not have original classification authority originates information believed by that person to require classification, the information shall be protected in a manner consistent with this order and its implementing directives. The information shall be transmitted promptly as provided under this order or its implementing directives to the agency that has appropriate subject matter interest and classification authority with respect to this information. That agency shall decide within 30 days whether to classify this information. If it is not clear which agency has classification responsibility for this information, it shall be sent to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office. The Director shall determine the agency having primary subject matter interest and forward the information, with appropriate recommendations, to that agency for a classification determination.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 1.4. <em>Classification Categories</em>. Information shall not be considered for classification unless it concerns:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) military plans, weapons systems, or operations;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) foreign government information;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) intelligence activities (including special activities), intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources;</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to the national security, which includes defense against transnational terrorism;</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) United States Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities;</p>

<p class="note-body">(h) weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 1.5. <em>Duration of Classification</em>. (a) At the time of original classification, the original classification authority shall attempt to establish a specific date or event for declassification based upon the duration of the national security sensitivity of the information. Upon reaching the date or event, the information shall be automatically declassified. The date or event shall not exceed the time frame established in paragraph (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) If the original classification authority cannot determine an earlier specific date or event for declassification, information shall be marked for declassification 10 years from the date of the original decision, unless the original classification authority otherwise determines that the sensitivity of the information requires that it shall be marked for declassification for up to 25 years from the date of the original decision. All information classified under this section shall be subject to section 3.3 of this order if it is contained in records of permanent historical value under title 44, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) An original classification authority may extend the duration of classification, change the level of classification, or reclassify specific information only when the standards and procedures for classifying information under this order are followed.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Information marked for an indefinite duration of classification under predecessor orders, for example, marked as &ldquo;Originating Agency's Determination Required,&rdquo; or information classified under predecessor orders that contains no declassification instructions shall be declassified in accordance with part 3 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 1.6. <em>Identification and Markings</em>. (a) At the time of original classification, the following shall appear on the face of each classified document, or shall be applied to other classified media in an appropriate manner:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) one of the three classification levels defined in section 1.2 of this order;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) the identity, by name or personal identifier and position, of the original classification authority;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) the agency and office of origin, if not otherwise evident;</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) declassification instructions, which shall indicate one of the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) the date or event for declassification, as prescribed in section 1.5(a) or section 1.5(c);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) the date that is 10 years from the date of original classification, as prescribed in section 1.5(b); or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(C) the date that is up to 25 years from the date of original classification, as prescribed in section 1.5(b); and</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) a concise reason for classification that, at a minimum, cites the applicable classification categories in section 1.4 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Specific information described in paragraph (a) of this section may be excluded if it would reveal additional classified information.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) With respect to each classified document, the agency originating the document shall, by marking or other means, indicate which portions are classified, with the applicable classification level, and which portions are unclassified. In accordance with standards prescribed in directives issued under this order, the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office may grant waivers of this requirement. The Director shall revoke any waiver upon a finding of abuse.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Markings implementing the provisions of this order, including abbreviations and requirements to safeguard classified working papers, shall conform to the standards prescribed in implementing directives issued pursuant to this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Foreign government information shall retain its original classification markings or shall be assigned a <!-- PDFPage:197 -->U.S. classification that provides a degree of protection at least equivalent to that required by the entity that furnished the information. Foreign government information retaining its original classification markings need not be assigned a U.S. classification marking provided that the responsible agency determines that the foreign government markings are adequate to meet the purposes served by U.S. classification markings.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Information assigned a level of classification under this or predecessor orders shall be considered as classified at that level of classification despite the omission of other required markings. Whenever such information is used in the derivative classification process or is reviewed for possible declassification, holders of such information shall coordinate with an appropriate classification authority for the application of omitted markings.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) The classification authority shall, whenever practicable, use a classified addendum whenever classified information constitutes a small portion of an otherwise unclassified document.</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) Prior to public release, all declassified records shall be appropriately marked to reflect their declassification.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 1.7. <em>Classification Prohibitions and Limitations.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) In no case shall information be classified in order to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) restrain competition; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection in the interest of the national security.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Basic scientific research information not clearly related to the national security shall not be classified.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Information may be reclassified after declassification and release to the public under proper authority only in accordance with the following conditions:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) the reclassification action is taken under the personal authority of the agency head or deputy agency head, who determines in writing that the reclassification of the information is necessary in the interest of the national security;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) the information may be reasonably recovered; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) the reclassification action is reported promptly to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Information that has not previously been disclosed to the public under proper authority may be classified or reclassified after an agency has received a request for it under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or the mandatory review provisions of section 3.5 of this order only if such classification meets the requirements of this order and is accomplished on a document-by-document basis with the personal participation or under the direction of the agency head, the deputy agency head, or the senior agency official designated under section 5.4 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Compilations of items of information that are individually unclassified may be classified if the compiled information reveals an additional association or relationship that: (1) meets the standards for classification under this order; and (2) is not otherwise revealed in the individual items of information. As used in this order, &ldquo;compilation&rdquo; means an aggregation of pre-existing unclassified items of information.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 1.8. <em>Classification Challenges</em>. (a) Authorized holders of information who, in good faith, believe that its classification status is improper are encouraged and expected to challenge the classification status of the information in accordance with agency procedures established under paragraph (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In accordance with implementing directives issued pursuant to this order, an agency head or senior agency official shall establish procedures under which authorized holders of information are encouraged and expected to challenge the classification of information that they believe is improperly classified or unclassified. These procedures shall ensure that:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) individuals are not subject to retribution for bringing such actions;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) an opportunity is provided for review by an impartial official or panel; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) individuals are advised of their right to appeal agency decisions to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (Panel) established by section 5.3 of this order.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 2&mdash;DERIVATIVE CLASSIFICATION</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.1. <em>Use of Derivative Classification</em>. (a) Persons who only reproduce, extract, or summarize classified information, or who only apply classification markings derived from source material or as directed by a classification guide, need not possess original classification authority.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Persons who apply derivative classification markings shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) observe and respect original classification decisions; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) carry forward to any newly created documents the pertinent classification markings. For information derivatively classified based on multiple sources, the derivative classifier shall carry forward:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) the date or event for declassification that corresponds to the longest period of classification among the sources; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) a listing of these sources on or attached to the official file or record copy.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.2. <em>Classification Guides</em>. (a) Agencies with original classification authority shall prepare classification guides to facilitate the proper and uniform derivative classification of information. These guides shall conform to standards contained in directives issued under this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Each guide shall be approved personally and in writing by an official who:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) has program or supervisory responsibility over the information or is the senior agency official; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) is authorized to classify information originally at the highest level of classification prescribed in the guide.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Agencies shall establish procedures to ensure that classification guides are reviewed and updated as provided in directives issued under this order.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 3&mdash;DECLASSIFICATION AND DOWNGRADING</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3.1. <em>Authority for Declassification</em>. (a) Information shall be declassified as soon as it no longer meets the standards for classification under this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) It is presumed that information that continues to meet the classification requirements under this order requires continued protection. In some exceptional cases, however, the need to protect such information may be outweighed by the public interest in disclosure of the information, and in these cases the information should be declassified. When such questions arise, they shall be referred to the agency head or the senior agency official. That official will determine, as an exercise of discretion, whether the public interest in disclosure outweighs the damage to the national security that might reasonably be expected from disclosure. This provision does not:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) amplify or modify the substantive criteria or procedures for classification; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) create any substantive or procedural rights subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) If the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office determines that information is classified in violation of this order, the Director may require the information to be declassified by the agency that originated the classification. Any such decision by the Director may be appealed to the President through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. The information shall remain classified pending a prompt decision on the appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The provisions of this section shall also apply to agencies that, under the terms of this order, do not <!-- PDFPage:198 -->have original classification authority, but had such authority under predecessor orders.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3.2. <em>Transferred Records</em>. (a) In the case of classified records transferred in conjunction with a transfer of functions, and not merely for storage purposes, the receiving agency shall be deemed to be the originating agency for purposes of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In the case of classified records that are not officially transferred as described in paragraph (a) of this section, but that originated in an agency that has ceased to exist and for which there is no successor agency, each agency in possession of such records shall be deemed to be the originating agency for purposes of this order. Such records may be declassified or downgraded by the agency in possession after consultation with any other agency that has an interest in the subject matter of the records.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Classified records accessioned into the National Archives and Records Administration (National Archives) as of the effective date of this order shall be declassified or downgraded by the Archivist of the United States (Archivist) in accordance with this order, the directives issued pursuant to this order, agency declassification guides, and any existing procedural agreement between the Archivist and the relevant agency head.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The originating agency shall take all reasonable steps to declassify classified information contained in records determined to have permanent historical value before they are accessioned into the National Archives. However, the Archivist may require that classified records be accessioned into the National Archives when necessary to comply with the provisions of the Federal Records Act [see References in Text note set out under section 3603 of Title 44, Public Printing and Documents]. This provision does not apply to records being transferred to the Archivist pursuant to section 2203 of title 44, United States Code, or records for which the National Archives serves as the custodian of the records of an agency or organization that has gone out of existence.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) To the extent practicable, agencies shall adopt a system of records management that will facilitate the public release of documents at the time such documents are declassified pursuant to the provisions for automatic declassification in section 3.3 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3.3. <em>Automatic Declassification</em>. (a) Subject to paragraphs (b)&ndash;(e) of this section, on December 31, 2006, all classified records that (1) are more than 25 years old and (2) have been determined to have permanent historical value under title 44, United States Code, shall be automatically declassified whether or not the records have been reviewed. Subsequently, all classified records shall be automatically declassified on December 31 of the year that is 25 years from the date of its original classification, except as provided in paragraphs (b)&ndash;(e) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) An agency head may exempt from automatic declassification under paragraph (a) of this section specific information, the release of which could be expected to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) reveal the identity of a confidential human source, or a human intelligence source, or reveal information about the application of an intelligence source or method;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) reveal information that would assist in the development or use of weapons of mass destruction;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) reveal information that would impair U.S. cryptologic systems or activities;</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) reveal information that would impair the application of state of the art technology within a U.S. weapon system;</p>

<p class="note-body">(c) Classified information shall remain under the control of the originating agency or its successor in function. An agency shall not disclose information originally classified by another agency without its authorization. An official or employee leaving agency service may not remove classified information from the agency's control.</p>

<p class="note-body">(e) Persons authorized to disseminate classified information outside the executive branch shall ensure the protection of the information in a manner equivalent to that provided within the executive branch.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Consistent with law, directives, and regulation, an agency head or senior agency official shall establish uniform procedures to ensure that automated information systems, including networks and telecommunications systems, that collect, create, communicate, compute, disseminate, process, or store classified information have controls that:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) prevent access by unauthorized persons; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) ensure the integrity of the information.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) Consistent with law, directives, and regulation, each agency head or senior agency official shall establish controls to ensure that classified information is used, processed, stored, reproduced, transmitted, and destroyed under conditions that provide adequate protection and prevent access by unauthorized persons.</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) Consistent with directives issued pursuant to this order, an agency shall safeguard foreign government information under standards that provide a degree of protection at least equivalent to that required by the government or international organization of governments that furnished the information. When adequate to achieve equivalency, these standards may be less restrictive than the safeguarding standards that ordinarily apply to United States &ldquo;Confidential&rdquo; information, including modified handling and transmission and allowing access to individuals with a need-to-know who have not otherwise been cleared for access to classified information or executed an approved nondisclosure agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) Except as otherwise provided by statute, this order, directives implementing this order, or by direction of the President, classified information originating in one agency shall not be disseminated outside any other agency to which it has been made available without the consent of the originating agency. An agency head or senior agency official may waive this requirement for specific information originated within that agency.

Such actions shall be taken only in accordance with the directives implementing this order and any procedures issued by agencies governing the classified information, which shall be designed to minimize the classified information that is disclosed under these circumstances and the number of individuals who receive it. Information disclosed under this provision or implementing directives and procedures shall not be deemed declassified as a result of such disclosure or subsequent use by a recipient. Such disclosures shall be reported promptly to the originator of the classified information. For purposes of this section, the Director of Central Intelligence may issue an implementing directive governing the emergency disclosure of classified intelligence information.</p>

For special access programs pertaining to intelligence activities (including special activities, but not including military operational, strategic, and tactical programs), or intelligence sources or methods, this function shall be exercised by the Director of Central Intelligence. These officials shall keep the number of these programs at an absolute minimum, and shall establish them only when the program is required by statute or upon a specific finding that:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) the vulnerability of, or threat to, specific information is exceptional; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) the normal criteria for determining eligibility for access applicable to information classified at the same level are not deemed sufficient to protect the information from unauthorized disclosure.</p>

In addition, the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office shall be afforded access to these programs, in accordance with the security requirements of each program, in order to perform the functions assigned to the Information Security Oversight Office under this order. An agency head may limit access to a special access program to the Director and <!-- PDFPage:201 -->no more than one other employee of the Information Security Oversight Office, or, for special access programs that are extraordinarily sensitive and vulnerable, to the Director only.</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 2&mdash;ACCESS ELIGIBILITY POLICY AND PROCEDURE</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.1. <em>Eligibility Determinations</em>. (a) Determinations of eligibility for access to classified information shall be based on criteria established under this order. Such determinations are separate from suitability determinations with respect to the hiring or retention of persons for employment by the government or any other personnel actions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The number of employees that each agency determines are eligible for access to classified information shall be kept to the minimum required for the conduct of agency functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Eligibility for access to classified information shall not be requested or granted solely to permit entry to, or ease of movement within, controlled areas when the employee has no need for access and access to classified information may reasonably be prevented. Where circumstances indicate employees may be inadvertently exposed to classified information in the course of their duties, agencies are authorized to grant or deny, in their discretion, facility access approvals to such employees based on an appropriate level of investigation as determined by each agency.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Except in agencies where eligibility for access is a mandatory condition of employment, eligibility for access to classified information shall only be requested or granted based on a demonstrated, foreseeable need for access. Requesting or approving eligibility in excess of actual requirements is prohibited.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Eligibility for access to classified information may be granted where there is a temporary need for access, such as one-time participation in a classified project, provided the investigative standards established under this order have been satisfied. In such cases, a fixed date or event for expiration shall be identified and access to classified information shall be limited to information related to the particular project or assignment.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) Access to classified information shall be terminated when an employee no longer has a need for access.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.2. <em>Level of Access Approval</em>. (a) The level at which an access approval is granted for an employee shall be limited, and relate directly, to the level of classified information for which there is a need for access. Eligibility for access to a higher level of classified information includes eligibility for access to information classified at a lower level.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Access to classified information relating to a special access program shall be granted in accordance with procedures established by the head of the agency that created the program or, for programs pertaining to intelligence activities (including special activities but not including military operational, strategic, and tactical programs) or intelligence sources and methods, by the Director of Central Intelligence. To the extent possible and consistent with the national security interests of the United States, such procedures shall be consistent with the standards and procedures established by and under this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.3. <em>Temporary Access to Higher Levels</em>. (a) An employee who has been determined to be eligible for access to classified information based on favorable adjudication of a completed investigation may be granted temporary access to a higher level where security personnel authorized by the agency head to make access eligibility determinations find that such access:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) is necessary to meet operational or contractual exigencies not expected to be of a recurring nature;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) will not exceed 180 days; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) is limited to specific, identifiable information that is made the subject of a written access record.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Where the access granted under subsection (a) of this section involves another agency's classified information, that agency must concur before access to its information is granted.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.4. <em>Reciprocal Acceptance of Access Eligibility Determinations</em>. (a) Except when an agency has substantial information indicating that an employee may not satisfy the standards in section 3.1 of this order, background investigations and eligibility determinations conducted under this order shall be mutually and reciprocally accepted by all agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Except where there is substantial information indicating that the employee may not satisfy the standards in section 3.1 of this order, an employee with existing access to a special access program shall not be denied eligibility for access to another special access program at the same sensitivity level as determined personally by the agency head or deputy agency head, or have an existing access eligibility readjudicated, so long as the employee has a need for access to the information involved.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This section shall not preclude agency heads from establishing additional, but not duplicative, investigative or adjudicative procedures for a special access program or for candidates for detail or assignment to their agencies, where such procedures are required in exceptional circumstances to protect the national security.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Where temporary eligibility for access is granted under sections 2.3 or 3.3 of this order or where the determination of eligibility for access is conditional, the fact of such temporary or conditional access shall be conveyed to any other agency that considers affording the employee access to its information.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.5. <em>Specific Access Requirement</em>. (a) Employees who have been determined to be eligible for access to classified information shall be given access to classified information only where there is a need-to-know that information.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) It is the responsibility of employees who are authorized holders of classified information to verify that a prospective recipient's eligibility for access has been granted by an authorized agency official and to ensure that a need-to-know exists prior to allowing such access, and to challenge requests for access that do not appear well-founded.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.6. <em>Access by Non-United States Citizens</em>. (a) Where there are compelling reasons in furtherance of an agency mission, immigrant alien and foreign national employees who possess a special expertise may, in the discretion of the agency, be granted limited access to classified information only for specific programs, projects, contracts, licenses, certificates, or grants for which there is a need for access. Such individuals shall not be eligible for access to any greater level of classified information than the United States Government has determined may be releasable to the country of which the subject is currently a citizen, and such limited access may be approved only if the prior 10 years of the subject's life can be appropriately investigated. If there are any doubts concerning granting access, additional lawful investigative procedures shall be fully pursued.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Exceptions to these requirements may be permitted only by the agency head or the senior agency official designated under section 6.1 of this order to further substantial national security interests.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 3&mdash;ACCESS ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3.1. <em>Standards</em>. (a) No employee shall be deemed to be eligible for access to classified information merely by reason of Federal service or contracting, licensee, certificate holder, or grantee status, or as a matter of right or privilege, or as a result of any particular title, rank, position, or affiliation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Except as provided in sections 2.6 and 3.3 of this order, eligibility for access to classified information shall be granted only to employees who are United States citizens for whom an appropriate investigation has been completed and whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide <!-- PDFPage:208 -->by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information. A determination of eligibility for access to such information is a discretionary security decision based on judgments by appropriately trained adjudicative personnel. Eligibility shall be granted only where facts and circumstances indicate access to classified information is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States, and any doubt shall be resolved in favor of the national security.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The United States Government does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or sexual orientation in granting access to classified information.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) In determining eligibility for access under this order, agencies may investigate and consider any matter that relates to the determination of whether access is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. No inference concerning the standards in this section may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the employee.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) No negative inference concerning the standards in this section may be raised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. Such counseling can be a positive factor in eligibility determinations. However, mental health counseling, where relevant to the adjudication of access to classified information, may justify further inquiry to determine whether the standards of subsection (b) of this section are satisfied, and mental health may be considered where it directly relates to those standards.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Not later than 180 days after the effective date of this order, the Security Policy Board shall develop a common set of adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, including access to special access programs.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3.2. <em>Basis for Eligibility Approval</em>. (a) Eligibility determinations for access to classified information shall be based on information concerning the applicant or employee that is acquired through the investigation conducted pursuant to this order or otherwise available to security officials and shall be made part of the applicant's or employee's security record. Applicants or employees shall be required to provide relevant information pertaining to their background and character for use in investigating and adjudicating their eligibility for access.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Not later than 180 days after the effective date of this order, the Security Policy Board shall develop a common set of investigative standards for background investigations for access to classified information. These standards may vary for the various levels of access.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Nothing in this order shall prohibit an agency from utilizing any lawful investigative procedure in addition to the investigative requirements set forth in this order and its implementing regulations to resolve issues that may arise during the course of a background investigation or reinvestigation.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3.3. <em>Special Circumstances</em>. (a) In exceptional circumstances where official functions must be performed prior to the completion of the investigative and adjudication process, temporary eligibility for access to classified information may be granted to an employee while the initial investigation is underway. When such eligibility is granted, the initial investigation shall be expedited.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Temporary eligibility for access under this section shall include a justification, and the employee must be notified in writing that further access is expressly conditioned on the favorable completion of the investigation and issuance of an access eligibility approval. Access will be immediately terminated, along with any assignment requiring an access eligibility approval, if such approval is not granted.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Temporary eligibility for access may be granted only by security personnel authorized by the agency head to make access eligibility determinations and shall be based on minimum investigative standards developed by the Security Policy Board not later than 180 days after the effective date of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Temporary eligibility for access may be granted only to particular, identified categories of classified information necessary to perform the lawful and authorized functions that are the basis for the granting of temporary access.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Nothing in subsection (a) shall be construed as altering the authority of an agency head to waive requirements for granting access to classified information pursuant to statutory authority.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Where access has been terminated under section 2.1(b)(4) of this order and a new need for access arises, access eligibility up to the same level shall be reapproved without further investigation as to employees who were determined to be eligible based on a favorable adjudication of an investigation completed within the prior 5 years, provided they have remained employed by the same employer during the period in question, the employee certifies in writing that there has been no change in the relevant information provided by the employee for the last background investigation, and there is no information that would tend to indicate the employee may no longer satisfy the standards established by this order for access to classified information.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Access eligibility shall be reapproved for individuals who were determined to be eligible based on a favorable adjudication of an investigation completed within the prior 5 years and who have been retired or otherwise separated from United States Government employment for not more than 2 years; provided there is no indication the individual may no longer satisfy the standards of this order, the individual certifies in writing that there has been no change in the relevant information provided by the individual for the last background investigation, and an appropriate record check reveals no unfavorable information.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3.4. <em>Reinvestigation Requirements</em>. (a) Because circumstances and characteristics may change dramatically over time and thereby alter the eligibility of employees for continued access to classified information, reinvestigations shall be conducted with the same priority and care as initial investigations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Employees who are eligible for access to classified information shall be the subject of periodic reinvestigations and may also be reinvestigated if, at any time, there is reason to believe that they may no longer meet the standards for access established in this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Not later than 180 days after the effective date of this order, the Security Policy Board shall develop a common set of reinvestigative standards, including the frequency of reinvestigations.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 4&mdash;INVESTIGATIONS FOR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Authority</em>. Agencies that conduct background investigations, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of State, are authorized to conduct personnel security investigations in the United States when requested by a foreign government as part of its own personnel security program and with the consent of the individual.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 5&mdash;REVIEW OF ACCESS DETERMINATIONS</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5.1. <em>Determinations of Need for Access</em>. A determination under section 2.1(b)(4) of this order that an employee does not have, or no longer has, a need for access is a discretionary determination and shall be conclusive.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5.2. <em>Review Proceedings for Denials or Revocations of Eligibility for Access</em>. (a) Applicants and employees who are determined to not meet the standards for access to classified information established in section 3.1 of this order shall be:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) provided as comprehensive and detailed a written explanation of the basis for that conclusion as the national security interests of the United States and other applicable law permit;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) provided within 30 days, upon request and to the extent the documents would be provided if requested under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or <!-- PDFPage:209 -->the Privacy Act (3 U.S.C. 552a), as applicable, any documents, records, and reports upon which a denial or revocation is based;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) informed of their right to be represented by counsel or other representative at their own expense; to request any documents, records, and reports as described in section 5.2(a)(2) upon which a denial or revocation is based; and to request the entire investigative file, as permitted by the national security and other applicable law, which, if requested, shall be promptly provided prior to the time set for a written reply;</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) provided a reasonable opportunity to reply in writing to, and to request a review of, the determination;</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) provided written notice of and reasons for the results of the review, the identity of the deciding authority, and written notice of the right to appeal;</p>
<p class="note-body">(6) provided an opportunity to appeal in writing to a high level panel, appointed by the agency head, which shall be comprised of at least three members, two of whom shall be selected from outside the security field. Decisions of the panel shall be in writing, and final except as provided in subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(7) provided an opportunity to appear personally and to present relevant documents, materials, and information at some point in the process before an adjudicative or other authority, other than the investigating entity, as determined by the agency head. A written summary or recording of such appearance shall be made part of the applicant's or employee's security record, unless such appearance occurs in the presence of the appeals panel described in subsection (a)(6) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Nothing in this section shall prohibit an agency head from personally exercising the appeal authority in subsection (a)(6) of this section based upon recommendations from an appeals panel. In such case, the decision of the agency head shall be final.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Agency heads shall promulgate regulations to implement this section and, at their sole discretion and as resources and national security considerations permit, may provide additional review proceedings beyond those required by subsection (a) of this section. This section does not require additional proceedings, however, and creates no procedural or substantive rights.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) When the head of an agency or principal deputy personally certifies that a procedure set forth in this section cannot be made available in a particular case without damaging the national security interests of the United States by revealing classified information, the particular procedure shall not be made available. This certification shall be conclusive.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) This section shall not be deemed to limit or affect the responsibility and power of an agency head pursuant to any law or other Executive order to deny or terminate access to classified information in the interests of national security. The power and responsibility to deny or terminate access to classified information pursuant to any law or other Executive order may be exercised only where the agency head determines that the procedures prescribed in subsection (a) of this section cannot be invoked in a manner that is consistent with national security. This determination shall be conclusive.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f)(1) This section shall not be deemed to limit or affect the responsibility and power of an agency head to make determinations of suitability for employment.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Nothing in this section shall require that an agency provide the procedures prescribed in subsection (a) of this section to an applicant where a conditional offer of employment is withdrawn for reasons of suitability or any other reason other than denial of eligibility for access to classified information.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) A suitability determination shall not be used for the purpose of denying an applicant or employee the review proceedings of this section where there has been a denial or revocation of eligibility for access to classified information.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 6&mdash;IMPLEMENTATION</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6.1. <em>Agency Implementing Responsibilities</em>.
