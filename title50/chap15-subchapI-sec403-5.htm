<h4 class="note-head">Department of Defense Strategy for Open-source Intelligence</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;163, div. A, title IX, &sect;931, Jan. 6, 2006, 119 Stat. 3411, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is intelligence that is produced from publicly available information and is collected, exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience for the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence requirement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) With the Information Revolution, the amount, significance, and accessibility of open-source information has expanded significantly, but the intelligence community has not expanded its exploitation efforts and systems to produce open-source intelligence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The production of open-source intelligence is a valuable intelligence discipline that must be integrated into intelligence tasking, collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination to ensure that United States policymakers are fully and completely informed.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The dissemination and use of validated open-source intelligence inherently enables information sharing since open-source intelligence is produced without the use of sensitive sources and methods. Open-source intelligence products can be shared with the American public and foreign allies because of the unclassified nature of open-source intelligence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (popularly referred to as the &lsquo;9/11 Commission&rsquo;), in its final report released on July 22, 2004, identified shortfalls in the ability of the United States to use all-source intelligence, a large component of which is open-source intelligence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law 108&ndash;458) [see Tables for classification], Congress calls for coordination of the collection, analysis, production, and dissemination of open-source intelligence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction, in its report to the President released on March 31, 2005, found that &lsquo;the need for exploiting open-source material is greater now than ever before,&rsquo; but that &lsquo;the Intelligence Community's open source programs have not expanded commensurate with either the increase in available information or with the growing importance of open source data to today's problems&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Department of Defense Strategy for Open-Source Intelligence.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Development of strategy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall develop a strategy for the purpose of integrating open-source intelligence into the Defense intelligence process. The strategy shall be known as the &lsquo;Defense Strategy for Open-Source Intelligence&rsquo;. <!-- PDFPage:119 -->The strategy shall be incorporated within the larger Defense intelligence strategy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Submission</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall submit to Congress a report setting forth the strategy developed under paragraph (1). The report shall be submitted not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Jan. 6, 2006].</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Matters to Be Included</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The strategy under subsection (b) shall include the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) A plan for providing funds over the period of the future-years defense program for the development of a robust open-source intelligence capability for the Department of Defense, with particular emphasis on exploitation and dissemination.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) A description of how management of the collection of open-source intelligence is currently conducted within the Department of Defense and how that management can be improved.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) A description of the tools, systems, centers, organizational entities, and procedures to be used within the Department of Defense to perform open-source intelligence tasking, collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) A description of proven tradecraft for effective exploitation of open-source intelligence, to include consideration of operational security.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) A detailed description on how open-source intelligence will be fused with all other intelligence sources across the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) A description of&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) a training plan for Department of Defense intelligence personnel with respect to open-source intelligence; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) open-source intelligence guidance for Department of Defense intelligence personnel.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) A plan to incorporate the function of oversight of open-source intelligence&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) into the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) into service intelligence organizations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) A plan to incorporate and identify an open-source intelligence specialty into personnel systems of the Department of Defense, including military personnel systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) A plan for the use of intelligence personnel of the reserve components to augment and support the open-source intelligence mission.</p>
