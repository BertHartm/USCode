<p class="statutory-body">(3) The declassification of some of the information contained in an exempted operational file shall not affect the status of the operational file as being exempt from search, review, publication, or disclosure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Records from exempted operational files that have been disseminated to and referenced in files that are not exempted under subsection (a) of this section and that have been returned to exempted operational files for sole retention shall be subject to search and review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Allegation; improper withholding of records; judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), whenever any person who has requested agency records under section 552 of title 5 alleges that the Defense Intelligence Agency has withheld records improperly because of failure to comply with any provision of this section, judicial review shall be available under the terms set forth in section 552(a)(4)(B) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Judicial review shall not be available in the manner provided under paragraph (1) as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In any case in which information specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign relations which is filed with, or produced for, the court by the Defense Intelligence Agency, such information shall be examined ex parte, in camera by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The court shall determine, to the fullest extent practicable, issues of fact based on sworn written submissions of the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) When a complainant alleges that requested records were improperly withheld because of improper placement solely in exempted operational files, the complainant shall support such allegation with a sworn written submission based upon personal knowledge or otherwise admissible evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D)(i) When a complainant alleges that requested records were improperly withheld because of improper exemption of operational files, the Defense Intelligence Agency shall meet its burden under section 552(a)(4)(B) of title 5 by demonstrating to the court by sworn written submission that exempted operational files likely to contain responsible records currently perform the functions set forth in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The court may not order the Defense Intelligence Agency to review the content of any exempted operational file or files in order to make the demonstration required under clause <!-- PDFPage:185 -->(i), unless the complainant disputes the Defense Intelligence Agency's showing with a sworn written submission based on personal knowledge or otherwise admissible evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) In proceedings under subparagraphs (C) and (D), the parties shall not obtain discovery pursuant to rules 26 through 36 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, except that requests for admission may be made pursuant to rules 26 and 36.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) If the court finds under this subsection that the Defense Intelligence Agency has improperly withheld requested records because of failure to comply with any provision of this subsection, the court shall order the Defense Intelligence Agency to search and review the appropriate exempted operational file or files for the requested records and make such records, or portions thereof, available in accordance with the provisions of section 552 of title 5, and such order shall be the exclusive remedy for failure to comply with this section (other than subsection (f)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) If at any time following the filing of a complaint pursuant to this paragraph the Defense Intelligence Agency agrees to search the appropriate exempted operational file or files for the requested records, the court shall dismiss the claim based upon such complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) Any information filed with, or produced for the court pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (D) shall be coordinated with the Director of National Intelligence before submission to the court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Decennial review of exempted operational files</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not less than once every 10 years, the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Director of National Intelligence shall review the exemptions in force under subsection (a) of this section to determine whether such exemptions may be removed from a category of exempted files or any portion thereof. The Director of National Intelligence must approve any determinations to remove such exemptions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The review required by paragraph (1) shall include consideration of the historical value or other public interest in the subject matter of the particular category of files or portions thereof and the potential for declassifying a significant part of the information contained therein.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A complainant that alleges that the Defense Intelligence Agency has improperly withheld records because of failure to comply with this subsection may seek judicial review in the district court of the United States of the district in which any of the parties reside, or in the District of Columbia.
