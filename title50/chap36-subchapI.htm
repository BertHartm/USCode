<p class="statutory-body">(2) An electronic surveillance authorized by this subsection may be conducted only in accordance with the Attorney General's certification and the minimization procedures adopted by him.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an application for a court order with respect to the surveillance is made under sections 1801(h)(4) and 1804 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the certification is necessary to determine the legality of the surveillance under section 1806(f) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) it is not reasonable to obtain the consent of persons incidentally subjected to the surveillance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such electronic surveillance is limited in extent and duration to that necessary to determine the existence and capability of such equipment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any information acquired by such surveillance is used only to enforce chapter 119 of title 18, or section 605 of title 47, or to protect information from unauthorized surveillance; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) train persons in the use of such equipment without engaging in electronic surveillance;</p>
