<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;245, Oct. 21, 2002, 116 Stat. 1504, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Sudan Peace Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The Government of Sudan has intensified its prosecution of the war against areas outside of its control, which has already cost more than 2,000,000 lives and has displaced more than 4,000,000 people.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) A viable, comprehensive, and internationally sponsored peace process, protected from manipulation, presents the best chance for a permanent resolution of the war, protection of human rights, and a self-sustaining Sudan.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Continued strengthening and reform of humanitarian relief operations in Sudan is an essential element in the effort to bring an end to the war.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Continued leadership by the United States is critical.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Regardless of the future political status of the areas of Sudan outside of the control of the Government of Sudan, the absence of credible civil authority and institutions is a major impediment to achieving self-sustenance by the Sudanese people and to meaningful progress toward a viable peace process. It is critical that credible civil authority and institutions play an important role in the reconstruction of post-war Sudan.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Through the manipulation of traditional rivalries among peoples in areas outside of its full control, the Government of Sudan has used divide-and-conquer techniques effectively to subjugate its population. However, internationally sponsored reconciliation efforts have played a critical role in reducing human suffering and the effectiveness of this tactic.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The Government of Sudan utilizes and organizes militias, Popular Defense Forces, and other irregular units for raiding and enslaving parties in areas outside of the control of the Government of Sudan in an effort to disrupt severely the ability of the populations in those areas to sustain themselves. The tactic helps minimize the Government of Sudan's accountability internationally.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The Government of Sudan has repeatedly stated that it intends to use the expected proceeds from future oil sales to increase the tempo and lethality of the war against the areas outside of its control.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) By regularly banning air transport relief flights by the United Nations relief operation OLS, the Government of Sudan has been able to manipulate the receipt of food aid by the Sudanese people from the United States and other donor countries as a devastating weapon of war in the ongoing effort by the Government of Sudan to starve targeted groups and subdue areas of Sudan outside of the Government's control.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) The acts of the Government of Sudan, including the acts described in this section, constitute genocide as defined by the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (78 U.N.T.S. 277).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) The efforts of the United States and other donors in delivering relief and assistance through means outside of OLS have played a critical role in addressing the deficiencies in OLS and offset the Government of Sudan's manipulation of food donations to advantage in the civil war in Sudan.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) While the immediate needs of selected areas in Sudan facing starvation have been addressed in the near term, the population in areas of Sudan outside of the control of the Government of Sudan are still in danger of extreme disruption of their ability to sustain themselves.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) The Nuba Mountains and many areas in Bahr al Ghazal and the Upper Nile and the Blue Nile regions have been excluded completely from relief distribution by OLS, consequently placing their populations at increased risk of famine.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) At a cost which has sometimes exceeded $1,000,000 per day, and with a primary focus on providing only for the immediate food needs of the recipients, the current international relief operations are neither sustainable nor desirable in the long term.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) The ability of populations to defend themselves against attack in areas outside of the control of the Government of Sudan has been severely compromised by the disengagement of the front-line states of Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Uganda, fostering the belief among officials of the Government of Sudan that success on the battlefield can be achieved.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) The United States should use all means of pressure available to facilitate a comprehensive solution to the war in Sudan, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the multilateralization of economic and diplomatic tools to compel the Government of Sudan to enter into a good faith peace process;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) the support or creation of viable democratic civil authority and institutions in areas of Sudan outside of government control;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) continued active support of people-to-people reconciliation mechanisms and efforts in areas outside of government control;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) the strengthening of the mechanisms to provide humanitarian relief to those areas; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) cooperation among the trading partners of the United States and within multilateral institutions toward those ends.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;In this Act:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Appropriate congressional committees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &lsquo;appropriate congressional committees&rsquo; means the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Government of sudan</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &lsquo;Government of Sudan&rsquo; means the National Islamic Front government in Khartoum, Sudan.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress hereby&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:246 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) condemns&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) violations of human rights on all sides of the conflict in Sudan;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) the Government of Sudan's overall human rights record, with regard to both the prosecution of the war and the denial of basic human and political rights to all Sudanese;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) the ongoing slave trade in Sudan and the role of the Government of Sudan in abetting and tolerating the practice;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) the Government of Sudan's use and organization of &lsquo;murahalliin&rsquo; or &lsquo;mujahadeen&rsquo;, Popular Defense Forces, and regular Sudanese Army units into organized and coordinated raiding and slaving parties in Bahr al Ghazal, the Nuba Mountains, and the Upper Nile and the Blue Nile regions; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) aerial bombardment of civilian targets that is sponsored by the Government of Sudan; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) recognizes that, along with selective bans on air transport relief flights by the Government of Sudan, the use of raiding and slaving parties is a tool for creating food shortages and is used as a systematic means to destroy the societies, culture, and economies of the Dinka, Nuer, and Nuba peoples in a policy of low-intensity ethnic cleansing.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 6. SUPPORT FOR AN INTERNATIONALLY SANCTIONED PEACE PROCESS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress hereby&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) recognizes that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) a single, viable internationally and regionally sanctioned peace process holds the greatest opportunity to promote a negotiated, peaceful settlement to the war in Sudan; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) resolution to the conflict in Sudan is best made through a peace process based on the Declaration of Principles reached in Nairobi, Kenya, on July 20, 1994, and on the Machakos Protocol in July 2002; and</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The efforts of the Government of Iran to acquire weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them and its support of acts of international terrorism endanger the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and those countries with which the United States shares common strategic and foreign policy objectives.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The objective of preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and acts of international terrorism through existing multilateral and bilateral initiatives requires additional efforts to deny Iran the financial means to sustain its nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile weapons programs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Government of Iran uses its diplomatic facilities and quasi-governmental institutions outside of Iran to promote acts of international terrorism and assist its nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile weapons programs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The failure of the Government of Libya to comply with Resolutions 731, 748, and 883 of the Security Council of the United Nations, its support of international terrorism, and its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction constitute a threat to international peace and security that endangers the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and those countries with which it shares common strategic and foreign policy objectives.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Policy With Respect to Iran</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States to deny Iran the ability to support acts of international terrorism and to fund the development and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them by limiting the development of Iran's ability to explore for, extract, refine, or transport by pipeline petroleum resources of Iran.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Policy With Respect to Libya</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress further declares that it is the policy of the United States to seek full compliance by Libya with its obligations under Resolutions 731, 748, and 883 of the Security Council of the United Nations, including ending all support for acts of international terrorism and efforts to develop or acquire weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p class="note-body">The crisis between the United States and Libya that led to the declaration of a national emergency on January 7, 1986, has not been resolved. Despite the United Nations Security Council's suspension of U.N. sanctions against Libya upon the Libyan government's hand-over of the Pan Am 103 bombing suspects, Libya has not yet complied with its obligations under U.N. Security Council Resolutions 731 (1992), 748 (1992), and 883 (1993), which include Libya's obligation to accept responsibility for the actions of its officials and pay compensation.</p>

<p class="note-body">Notice of President of the United States, dated July 30, 2002, 67 F.R. 50341, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">On August 2, 1990, by Executive Order 12722 [set out above], President Bush declared a national emergency with respect to Iraq pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701&ndash;1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and polices of the Government of Iraq. By Executive Orders 12722 of August 2, 1990, and 12724 of August 9, 1990 [set out below], the President imposed trade sanctions on Iraq and blocked Iraqi government assets. Because the Government of Iraq has continued to engage in activities hostile to U.S. interests, the national emergency declared on August 2, 1990, and the measures adopted on August 2 and August 9, 1990, to deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond August 2, 2002. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Iraq.</p>

<p class="note-body">On October 25, 1994, President Clinton expanded the scope of the national emergency by issuing Executive Order 12934 [set out below] to address the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the territory that they controlled within Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p class="note-body">On December 27, 1995, President Clinton issued Presidential Determination 96&ndash;7 [set out above], directing the Secretary of the Treasury, <em>inter alia</em>, to suspend the application of sanctions imposed on the FRY (S&M) pursuant to the above-referenced Executive Orders and to continue to block property previously blocked until provision is made to address claims or encumbrances, including the claims of the other successor states of the former Yugoslavia. This sanctions relief, in conformity with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1022 of November 22, 1995, was an essential factor motivating the FRY (S&M)'s acceptance of a peace agreement initialed by the parties in Dayton on November 21, 1995, and signed in Paris on December 14, 1995 (hereinafter the &ldquo;Peace Agreement&rdquo;). Sanctions against both the FRY (S&M) and the Bosnian Serb forces were terminated in conjunction with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1074 of October 1, 1996. This termination, however, did not end a requirement that those blocked funds and assets that are subject to claims or encumbrances remain blocked, until unblocked in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<p class="note-body">Until the status of all remaining blocked property is resolved, the Peace Agreement implemented, and the terms of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1022 met, the national emergency declared on May 30, 1992, and the measures adopted pursuant thereto to deal with that emergency, must continue beyond May 30, 2002.</p>
<p class="note-body">On June 9, 1998, by Executive Order 13088 [set out below], President Clinton found that the actions and policies of the FRY (S&M) and the Republic of Serbia with respect to Kosovo, constituted an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. President Clinton therefore declared a national emergency to deal with that threat.</p>
<p class="note-body">On January 17, 2001, President Clinton issued Executive Order 13192 amending Executive Order 13088 [set out below] to lift and modify, with respect to future transactions, most of the economic sanctions imposed against the FRY (S&M). At the same time, Executive Order 13192 imposes restrictions on transactions with certain persons described in section 1(a) of the order, namely persons under open indictment for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). It also provides for the continued blocking of property or interests in property blocked prior to the order's effective date due to the need to address claims or encumbrances involving such property.</p>
<p class="note-body">Because the crisis with respect to the situation in Kosovo and with respect to Slobodan Milosevic, his <!-- PDFPage:278 -->close associates and supporters and persons under open indictment for war crimes by the ICTY has not been resolved, and because the status of all previously blocked property has yet to be resolved, I have determined that the national emergency declared on June 9, 1998, and the measures adopted pursuant thereto to deal with that emergency, must continue beyond June 9, 2002.</p>

<p class="note-body">Notice of President of the United States, dated Sept. 23, 2002, 67 F.R. 60105, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">In accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared by the President on September 26, 1993, by Executive Order 12865 [set out above], to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). The order prohibits the sale or supply by United States persons or from the United States, or using U.S. registered vessels or aircraft, of arms, related materiel of all types, petroleum, and petroleum products to the territory of Angola, other than through designated points of entry. The order also prohibits the sale or supply of such commodities to UNITA.</p>
<p class="note-body">The President took additional measures with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12865 by issuing Executive Orders 13069 [set out below] and 13098 [set out below] on December 12, 1997, and August 18, 1998, respectively. Those orders close all UNITA offices in the United States, block all property and interests in property of UNITA and designated UNITA officials and adult members of their immediate families, prohibit the importation of certain diamonds exported from Angola, and impose additional sanctions with respect to the provision of mining and transportation equipment and services.</p>
<p class="note-body">Because of our continuing international obligations and because of the prejudicial effect that discontinuation of the sanctions would have on prospects for peace in Angola, the national emergency declared on September 26, 1993, and the measures adopted pursuant thereto to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond September 26, 2002. Therefore, I am continuing the national emergency with respect to UNITA.</p>

<p class="note-body">On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938 [set out above], President Clinton declared a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons (weapons of mass destruction) and the means of delivering such weapons. On July 28, 1998, the President issued Executive Order 13094 to amend Executive Order 12938 to more effectively respond to the worldwide threat of weapons of mass destruction proliferation activities. Because the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the national emergency first declared on November 14, 1994, and extended on November 14, 1995, November 12, 1996, November 13, 1997, November 12, 1998, November 10, 1999, November 12, 2000, and November 9, 2001, must continue in effect beyond November 14, 2002.

<p class="note-body">On March 15, 1995, by Executive Order 12957 [set out above], the President declared a national emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701&ndash;1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Iran, including its support for international terrorism, efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process, and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. On May 6, 1995, the President issued Executive Order 12959 [set out below] imposing more comprehensive sanctions to further respond to this threat, and on August 19, 1997, the President issued Executive Order 13059 [set out below] consolidating and clarifying the previous orders.</p>
<p class="note-body">Because the actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the national emergency declared on March 15, 1995, must continue in effect beyond March 15, 2003. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Iran. Because the emergency declared by Executive Order 12957 constitutes an emergency separate from that declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170 [set out above], this renewal is distinct from the emergency renewal of November 2002.

<p class="note-body">Notice of President of the United States, dated May 16, 2002, 67 F.R. 35423, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">On May 20, 1997, the President issued Executive Order 13047 [set out above], certifying to the Congress under section 570(b) of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 104&ndash;208 [110 Stat. 3009&ndash;166]) that the Government of Burma had committed large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in Burma after September 30, 1996, thereby invoking the prohibition on new investment in Burma by United States persons contained in that section. The President also declared a national emergency to deal with the threat posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States by the actions and policies of the Government of Burma, invoking the authority, <em>inter alia</em>, of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">Because actions and policies of the Government of Burma continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on May 20, 1997, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond May 20, 2002. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Burma. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.</p>

A major national security goal of the United States is to ensure that fissile material removed from Russian nuclear weapons pursuant to various arms control and disarmament agreements is dedicated to peaceful uses, subject to transparency measures, and protected from diversion to activities of proliferation concern. As reflected in Executive Order 13085, the full implementation of the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation Concerning the Disposition of Highly Enriched Uranium Extracted from Nuclear Weapons, dated February 18, 1993, and related contracts and agreements (collectively, the &ldquo;HEU Agreements&rdquo;) is essential to the attainment of this goal. The HEU Agreements provide for the conversion of approximately 500 metric tons of highly enriched uranium contained in Russian nuclear weapons into low-enriched uranium for use as fuel in commercial nuclear reactors.

The HEU Agreements allow for the downblending of highly enriched uranium derived from nuclear weapons to low enriched uranium for peaceful commercial purposes. The Order invoked the authority, <em>inter alia</em>, of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 <em>et seq</em>., and declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the risk of nuclear proliferation created by the accumulation of a large volume of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of the Russian Federation.</p>

Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of the Russian Federation.

<p class="note-body">I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, take note that the people of Sierra Leone have suffered the ravages of a brutal civil war for nearly 10 years, and that the United Nations Security Council has determined that the situation in Sierra Leone constitutes a threat to international peace and security in the region and also has expressed concerns regarding the role played by the illicit trade in diamonds in fueling the conflict in Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone's insurgent Revolutionary United Front's (RUF's) illicit trade in diamonds from Sierra Leone to fund its operations and procurement of weapons, the RUF's flagrant violation of the Lome Peace Agreement of July 7, 1999, and its attacks on personnel of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone are direct challenges to the United States foreign policy objectives in the region as well as a direct challenge to the rule-based international order which is crucial to the peace and prosperity of the United States. Therefore, I find these actions constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States and hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat. In order to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1306 and to ensure that the direct or indirect importation into the United States of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone will not contribute financial support to aggressive actions by the RUF or to the RUF's procurement of weapons, while at the same time seeking to avoid undermining the legitimate diamond trade or diminishing confidence in the integrity of the legitimate diamond industry, I hereby order:</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13213, May 22, 2001, 66 F.R. 28829, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <em>et seq</em>.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 <em>et seq</em>.), section 5 of the United Nations Participation Act of 1945, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c) (UNPA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and in view of the national emergency described and declared in Executive Order 13194 of January 18, 2001 [set out above], and United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1306 of July 5, 2000, and 1343 of March 7, 2001,</p>
<p class="note-body">I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, take note that in Executive Order 13194, the President responded to, among other things, the insurgent Revolutionary United Front's (RUF) illicit trade in diamonds to fund its operations in the civil war in Sierra Leone by declaring a national emergency and, consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1306, by prohibiting the importation into the United States of all rough diamonds from Sierra Leone except for those importations controlled through the Certificate of Origin regime of the Government of Sierra Leone. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1343 takes note that the bulk of RUF diamonds leaves Sierra Leone through Liberia and that such illicit trade cannot be conducted without the permission and involvement of Liberian government officials at the highest levels; determines that the active support provided by the Government of Liberia for the RUF and other armed rebel groups in neighboring countries constitutes a threat to international peace and security in the region; and decides that all states shall take the necessary measures to prevent the importation of all rough diamonds from Liberia, whether or not such diamonds originated in Liberia. The Government of Liberia's complicity in the RUF's illicit trade in diamonds and its other forms of support for the RUF are direct challenges to United States foreign policy objectives in the region as well as to the rule-based international order that is crucial to the peace and prosperity of the United States. Therefore, I find these actions by the Government of Liberia contribute to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States described in Executive Order 13194 with respect to which the President declared a national emergency. In order to deal with that threat and to ensure further that the direct or indirect importation into the United States of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone will not contribute financial support to further aggressive actions by the RUF or to the RUF's procurement of weapons; to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1343; and to counteract, among other things, <!-- PDFPage:299 -->the Government of Liberia's facilitation of and participation in the RUF's illicit trade in diamonds through Liberia, I hereby order the following additional measures be taken with respect to prohibiting the importation of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. Except to the extent provided in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding the existence of any rights or obligations conferred or imposed by any international agreement or any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order, the direct or indirect importation into the United States of all rough diamonds from Liberia, whether or not such diamonds originated in Liberia, on or after the effective date of this order is prohibited.</p>

Because the actions of these persons, which threaten the peace and international stabilization efforts in the Western Balkans, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on June 26, 2001, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond June 26, 2002. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans.</p>

<p class="note-body">On August 17, 2001, consistent with the authority provided me under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <em>et seq</em>.), I issued Executive Order 13222 [set out above]. In that order, I declared a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States in light of the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 <em>et seq</em>.). Because the Export Administration Act has not been renewed by the Congress, the national emergency declared on August 17, 2001, must continue in effect beyond August 17, 2002. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13222.</p>

<p class="note-body">I, GEORGE W.

No. 7463, 50 U.S.C. 1621 note], hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat. I also find that because of the pervasiveness and expansiveness of the financial foundation of foreign terrorists, financial sanctions may be appropriate for those foreign persons that support or otherwise associate with these foreign terrorists. I also find that a need exists for further consultation and cooperation with, and sharing of information by, United States and foreign financial institutions as an additional tool to enable the United States to combat the financing of terrorism.</p>

Except to the extent required by section 203(b) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)), or provided in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) any transaction or dealing by United States persons or within the United States in property or interests in property blocked pursuant to this order is prohibited, including but not limited to the making or receiving of any contribution of funds, goods, or services to or for the benefit of those persons listed in the Annex to this order or determined to be subject to this order;</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by United States persons to persons determined to be subject to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and would endanger Armed Forces of the United States that are in a situation where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, and hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order. Furthermore, I hereby determine that the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (title IX, Public Law 106&ndash;387) [22 U.S.C. 7201 et seq.] shall not affect the imposition or the continuation of the imposition of any unilateral agricultural sanction or unilateral medical sanction on any person determined to be subject to this order because imminent involvement of the Armed Forces of the United States in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. With respect to those persons designated pursuant to subsection 1(d) of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury, in the exercise of his discretion and in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Attorney General, may take such other actions than the complete blocking of property or interests in property as the President is authorized to take under IEEPA and UNPA if the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Attorney General, deems such other actions to be consistent with the national interests of the United States, considering such factors as he deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. The Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and other appropriate agencies shall make all relevant efforts to cooperate and coordinate with other countries, including through technical assistance, as well as bilateral and multilateral agreements and arrangements, to achieve the objectives of this order, including the prevention and suppression of acts of terrorism, the denial of financing and financial services to terrorists and terrorist organizations, and the sharing of intelligence about funding activities in support of terrorism.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Attorney General, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA and UNPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. Nothing in this order is intended to affect the continued effectiveness of any rules, regulations, orders, licenses, or other forms of administrative action issued, taken, or continued in effect heretofore or hereafter under 31 C.F.R. chapter V, except as expressly terminated, modified, or suspended by or pursuant to this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9.

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 10. For those persons listed in the Annex to this order or determined to be subject to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to this order.</p>

Because the actions of these persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the national emergency declared on September 23, 2001, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond September 23, 2002.
