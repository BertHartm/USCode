<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;113, div. B, &sect;1000(a)(7) [div. B, title XII, subtitle D], Nov. 29, 1999, 113 Stat. 1536, 1501A&ndash;500, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 1241. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This subtitle may be cited as the &lsquo;Defense Offsets Disclosure Act of 1999&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 1242. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) A fair business environment is necessary to advance international trade, economic stability, and development worldwide, is beneficial for American workers and businesses, and is in the United States national interest.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In some cases, mandated offset requirements can cause economic distortions in international defense trade and undermine fairness and competitiveness, and may cause particular harm to small- and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The use of offsets may lead to increasing dependence on foreign suppliers for the production of United States weapons systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The offset demands required by some purchasing countries, including some close allies of the United States, equal or exceed the value of the base contract they are intended to offset, mitigating much of the potential economic benefit of the exports.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Offset demands often unduly distort the prices of defense contracts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In some cases, United States contractors are required to provide indirect offsets which can negatively impact nondefense industrial sectors.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Unilateral efforts by the United States to prohibit offsets may be impractical in the current era of globalization and would severely hinder the competi<!-- PDFPage:246 -->tiveness of the United States defense industry in the global market.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The development of global standards to manage and restrict demands for offsets would enhance United States efforts to mitigate the negative impact of offsets.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Declaration of Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the United States to monitor the use of offsets in international defense trade, to promote fairness in such trade, and to ensure that foreign participation in the production of United States weapons systems does not harm the economy of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 1243. DEFINITIONS.</h4>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, or their designees, should raise with other industrialized nations at every suitable venue the need for transparency and reasonable standards to govern the role of offsets in international defense trade;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the United States Government should enter into discussions regarding the establishment of multilateral standards for the use of offsets in international defense trade through the appropriate multilateral fora, including such organizations as the Transatlantic Economic Partnership, the Wassenaar Arrangement, the G&ndash;8, and the World Trade Organization; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the United States Government, in entering into the discussions described in paragraph (3), should take into account the distortions produced by the provision of other benefits and subsidies, such as export financing, by various countries to support defense trade.</p>
