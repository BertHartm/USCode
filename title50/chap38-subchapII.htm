<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Annuity of participant</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Computation of annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The annuity of a participant is the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the participant's high-3 average pay (as defined in paragraph (4)); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of years, not exceeding 35, of service credit (determined in accordance with sections 2081 and 2082 of this title) multiplied by 2 percent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Credit for unused sick leave</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The total service of a participant who retires on an immediate annuity (except under section 2051 of this title) or who dies leaving a survivor or survivors entitled to an annuity shall include (without regard to the 35-year limitation prescribed in paragraph (1)) the days of unused sick leave to the credit of the participant. Days of unused sick leave may not be counted in determining average basic pay or eligibility for an annuity under this subchapter. A deposit shall not be required for days of unused sick leave credited under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Crediting of part-time service</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a participant whose service includes service on a part-time basis performed after April 6, 1986, the participant's annuity shall be the sum of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (B) and (C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Computation of pre-April 7, 1986, annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The portion of an annuity referred to in subparagraph (A) with respect to service before April 7, 1986, shall be the amount computed under paragraph (1) using the participant's length of service before that date (increased by the unused sick leave to the credit of the participant at the time of retirement) and the participant's high-3 average pay.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Computation of post-April 6, 1986, annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The portion of an annuity referred to in subparagraph (A) with respect to service after April 6, 1986, shall be the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount computed under paragraph (1), using the participant's length of service after that date and the participant's high-3 average pay, as determined by using the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the ratio which the participant's actual service after April 6, 1986 (as determined by prorating the participant's total service after that date to reflect the service that was performed on a part-time basis) bears to the total service after that date that would be creditable for the participant if all the service had been performed on a full-time basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Treatment of employment on temporary or intermittent basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Employment on a temporary or intermittent basis shall not be considered to be service on a part-time basis for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) High-3 average pay defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, a participant's high-3 average pay is the amount of the participant's average basic pay for the highest 3 consecutive years of the participant's service for which full contributions have been made to the fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Computation of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the aggregate period of service upon which an annuity is to be based, any fractional part of a month shall not be counted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Spouse or former spouse survivor annuity</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Reduction in participant's annuity to provide spouse or former spouse survivor annuity</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except to the extent provided otherwise under a written election under subparagraph (B) or (C), if at the time of retirement a participant or former participant is married (or has a former spouse who has not remarried before attaining age 55), the participant shall receive a reduced annuity and provide a survivor annuity for the participant's spouse under this subsection or former spouse under section 2032(b) of this title, or a combination of such annuities, as the case may be.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:311 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Joint election for waiver or reduction of spouse survivor annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A married participant or former participant and the participant's spouse may jointly elect in writing at the time of retirement to waive a survivor annuity for that spouse under this section or to reduce such survivor annuity under this section by designating a portion of the annuity of the participant as the base for the survivor annuity. If the marriage is dissolved following an election for such a reduced annuity and the spouse qualifies as a former spouse, the base used in calculating any annuity of the former spouse under section 2032(b) of this title may not exceed the portion of the participant's annuity designated under this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Joint election of participant and former spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a participant or former participant has a former spouse, such participant and the participant's former spouse may jointly elect by spousal agreement under section 2094(b) of this title to waive, reduce, or increase a survivor annuity under section 2032(b) of this title for that former spouse. Any such election must be made (i) before the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date on which the divorce or annulment involving that former spouse becomes final, or (ii) at the time of retirement of the participant, whichever is later.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Unilateral elections in absence of spouse or former spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Director may prescribe regulations under which a participant or former participant may make an election under subparagraph (B) or (C) without the participant's spouse or former spouse if the participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Director that the participant does not know, and has taken all reasonable steps to determine, the whereabouts of the spouse or former spouse.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of reduction in participant's annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The annuity of a participant or former participant providing a survivor annuity under this section (or section 2032(b) of this title), excluding any portion of the annuity not designated or committed as a base for any survivor annuity, shall be reduced by 21/2 percent of the first $3,600 plus 10 percent of any amount over $3,600. The reduction under this paragraph shall be calculated before any reduction under section 2032(a)(5) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Amount of surviving spouse annuity</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a retired participant receiving a reduced annuity under this subsection dies and is survived by a spouse, a survivor annuity shall be paid to the surviving spouse. The amount of the annuity shall be equal to 55 percent of (i) the full amount of the participant's annuity computed under subsection (a) of this section, or (ii) any lesser amount elected as the base for the survivor annuity under paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the amount of the annuity calculated under subparagraph (A) for a surviving spouse in any case in which there is also a surviving former spouse of the retired participant who qualifies for an annuity under section 2032(b) of this title may not exceed 55 percent of the portion (if any) of the base for survivor annuities which remains available under section 2032(b)(4)(B) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Effective date and termination of annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An annuity payable from the fund to a surviving spouse under this paragraph shall commence on the day after the retired participant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before the surviving spouse's death or remarriage before attaining age 55. If such survivor annuity is terminated because of remarriage, it shall be restored at the same rate commencing on the date such remarriage is dissolved by death, annulment, or divorce if any lump sum paid upon termination of the annuity is returned to the fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) 18-month open period after retirement to provide spouse coverage</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Survivor annuity elections</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Election when spouse coverage waived at time of retirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A participant or former participant who retires after March 31, 1992 and who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is married at the time of retirement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) elects at that time (in accordance with subsection (b) of this section) to waive a survivor annuity for the spouse,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of the retirement of the participant, elect to have a reduction under subsection (b) of this section made in the annuity of the participant (or in such portion thereof as the participant may designate) in order to provide a survivor annuity for the participant's spouse.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Election when reduced spouse annuity elected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A participant or former participant who retires after March 31, 1992, and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) who, at the time of retirement, is married, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) who, at that time designates (in accordance with subsection (b) of this section) that a portion of the annuity of such participant is to be used as the base for a survivor annuity,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of the retirement of such participant, elect to have a greater portion of the annuity of such participant so used.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Deposit required</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Requirement</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the difference (for the period between the date on which the annuity of the participant or former participant commences and the date of the election) between the amount paid to such participant or former participant under this subchapter and the amount which would have been paid if such election had been made at the time the participant or former participant applied for the annuity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the costs associated with providing for the later election.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Interest</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Voiding of previous elections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An election by a participant or former participant under this subsection voids prospectively any election previously made in the case of such participant under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Reductions in annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An annuity that is reduced in connection with an election under this subsection shall be reduced by the same percentage reductions as were in effect at the time of the retirement of the participant or former participant whose annuity is so reduced.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Rights and obligations resulting from reduced annuity election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Rights and obligations resulting from the election of a reduced annuity under this subsection shall be the same as the rights and obligations that would have resulted had the participant involved elected such annuity at the time of retirement.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commencement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An annuity payable to a child under subsection (d) of this section, or under section 2052(c) of this title, shall begin on the day after the date on which the participant or retired participant dies or, in the case of an individual over the age of 18 who is not a child within the meaning of section 2002(b) of this title, shall begin or resume on the first day of the month in which the individual later becomes or again becomes a student as described in section 2002(b) of this title.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Participants not married at time of retirement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Designation of persons with insurable interest</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Authority to make designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the rights of former spouses under subsection (b) of this section and section 2032 of this title, at the time of retirement an unmarried participant found by the Director to be in good health may elect to receive an annuity reduced in accordance with subparagraph (B) and designate in writing an individual having an insurable interest in the participant to receive an annuity under the system after the participant's death.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Reduction in participant's annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The annuity payable to the participant making such election shall be reduced by 10 percent of an annuity computed under subsection (a) of this section and by an additional 5 percent for each full 5 years the designated individual is younger than the participant.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Commencement of survivor annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The annuity payable to the designated individual shall begin on the day after the retired participant dies and terminate on the last day of the month before the designated individual dies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A participant who is unmarried at the time of retirement and who later marries may irrevocably elect, in a signed writing received by the Director within one year after the marriage, to receive a reduced annuity as provided in subsection (b) of this section. Such election and reduction shall be effective on the first day of the month beginning 9 months after the date of marriage. The election voids prospectively any election previously made under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Effect of divorce after retirement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Recomputation of retired participant's annuity upon divorce</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An annuity which is reduced under this section (or any similar prior provision of law) to provide a survivor annuity for a spouse shall, if the marriage of the retired participant to such spouse is dissolved, be recomputed and paid for each full month during which a retired participant is not married (or is remarried, if there is no election in effect under paragraph (2)) as if the annuity had not been so reduced, subject to any reduction required to provide a survivor annuity under subsection (b) or (c) of section 2032 of this title or under section 2036 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Election of survivor annuity upon subsequent remarriage</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon remarriage, the retired participant may irrevocably elect, by means of a signed writing received by the Director within one year after such remarriage, to receive a reduced annuity for the purpose of providing an annuity for the new spouse of the retired participant in the event such spouse survives the retired participant. Such reduction shall be equal to the reduction in effect immediately before the dissolution of the previous marriage (unless such reduction is adjusted under section 2032(b)(5) of this title or elected under subparagraph (B)).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) When annuity previously not (or not fully) reduced</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the retired participant's annuity was not reduced (or was not fully reduced) to provide a survivor annuity for the participant's spouse or former spouse as of the time of retirement, the retired participant may make an election under the first sentence of subparagraph (A) upon remarriage to a spouse other than the spouse at the time of retirement. For any remarriage that occurred before August 14, 1991, the retired participant may make such an election within 2 years after such date.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Deposit required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) The retired participant shall, within one year after the date of the remarriage (or by August 14, 1993 for any remarriage <!-- PDFPage:314 -->that occurred before August 14, 1991), deposit in the fund an amount determined by the Director, as nearly as may be administratively feasible, to reflect the amount by which the retired participant's annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date the annuity commenced, plus interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) The annual rate of interest for each year during which the retired participant's annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date the annuity commenced shall be 6 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) If the retired participant does not make the deposit, the Director shall collect such amount by offset against the participant's annuity, up to a maximum of 25 percent of the net annuity otherwise payable to the retired participant, and the retired participant is deemed to consent to such offset.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) The deposit required by this subparagraph may be made by the surviving spouse of the retired participant.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Former spouse share of participant's annuity</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Pro rata share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Unless otherwise expressly provided by a spousal agreement or court order under section 2094(b) of this title, a former spouse of a participant, former participant, or retired participant is entitled to an annuity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if married to the participant, former participant, or retired participant throughout the creditable service of the participant, equal to 50 percent of the annuity of the participant; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if not married to the participant throughout such creditable service, equal to that proportion of 50 percent of such annuity that is the proportion that the number of days of the marriage of the former spouse to the participant during periods of creditable service of such participant under this subchapter bears to the total number of days of such creditable service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Disqualification upon remarriage before age 55</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A former spouse is not qualified for an annuity under this subsection if before the commencement of that annuity the former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Commencement of annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The annuity of a former spouse under this subsection commences on the day the participant upon whose service the annuity is based becomes entitled to an annuity under this subchapter or on the first day of the month after the divorce or annulment involved becomes final, whichever is later.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Termination of annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The annuity of such former spouse and the right thereto terminate on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the last day of the month before the month in which the former spouse dies or remarries before 55 years of age; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the date on which the annuity of the participant terminates (except in the case of an annuity subject to paragraph (5)(B)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Treatment of participant's annuity</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Reduction in participant's annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The annuity payable to any participant shall be reduced by the amount of an annuity under this subsection paid to any former spouse based upon the service of that participant. Such reduction shall be disregarded in calculating&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the survivor annuity for any spouse, former spouse, or other survivor under this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any reduction in the annuity of the participant to provide survivor benefits under subsection (b) of this section or under section 2031(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Treatment when annuitant returns to service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an annuitant whose annuity is reduced under subparagraph (A) is recalled to service under section 2111 of this title, or reinstated or reappointed, in the case of a recovered disability annuitant, or if any annuitant is reemployed as provided for under sections 2112 and 2113 of this title, the pay of that annuitant shall be reduced by the same amount as the annuity would have been reduced if it had continued. Amounts equal to the reductions under this subparagraph shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Disability annuitant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (3), in the case of a former spouse of a disability annuitant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the annuity of that former spouse shall commence on the date on which the partici<!-- PDFPage:316 -->pant would qualify on the basis of the participant's creditable service for an annuity under this subchapter (other than a disability annuity) or the date on which the disability annuity begins, whichever is later, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of the annuity of the former spouse shall be calculated on the basis of the annuity for which the participant would otherwise so qualify.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Election of benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A former spouse of a participant, former participant, or retired participant shall not become entitled under this subsection to an annuity payable from the fund unless the former spouse elects to receive it instead of any survivor annuity to which the former spouse may be entitled under this or any other retirement system for Government employees on the basis of a marriage to someone other than the participant.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Limitation in case of multiple former spouse annuities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No spousal agreement or court order under section 2094(b) of this title involving a participant may provide for an annuity or a combination of annuities under this subsection that exceeds the annuity of the participant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Former spouse survivor annuity</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Pro rata share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to any election under section 2031(b)(1)(B) and (C) of this title and unless otherwise expressly provided by a spousal agreement or court order under section 2094(b) of this title, if an annuitant is survived by a former spouse, the former spouse shall be entitled&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if married to the annuitant throughout the creditable service of the annuitant, to a survivor annuity equal to 55 percent of the unreduced amount of the annuitant's annuity, as computed under section 2031(a) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if not married to the annuitant throughout such creditable service, to a survivor annuity equal to that proportion of 55 percent of the unreduced amount of such annuity that is the proportion that the number of days of the marriage of the former spouse to the participant during periods of creditable service of such participant under this subchapter bears to the total number of days of such creditable service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Disqualification upon remarriage before age 55</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A former spouse shall not be qualified for an annuity under this subsection if before the commencement of that annuity the former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Commencement, termination, and restoration of annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An annuity payable from the fund under this subchapter to a surviving former spouse under this subsection shall commence on the day after the annuitant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before the former spouse's death or remarriage before attaining age 55. If such a survivor annuity is terminated because of remarriage, it shall be restored at the same rate commencing on the date such remarriage is dissolved by death, annulment, or divorce if any lump sum paid upon termination of the annuity is returned to the fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Survivor annuity amount</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Maximum amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The maximum survivor annuity or combination of survivor annuities under this subsection (and section 2031(b)(3) of this title) with respect to any participant may not exceed 55 percent of the full amount of the participant's annuity, as calculated under section 2031(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation on other survivor annuities based on service of same participant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Once a survivor annuity has been provided under this subsection for any former spouse, a survivor annuity for another individual may thereafter be provided under this subsection (or section 2031(b)(3) of this title) with respect to the participant only for that portion (if any) of the maximum available which is not committed for survivor benefits for any former spouse whose prospective right to such annuity has not terminated by reason of death or remarriage.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Finality of court order upon death of participant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">After the death of a participant or retired participant, a court order under section 2094(b) of this title may not adjust the amount of the annuity of a former spouse of that participant or retired participant under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Effect of termination of former spouse entitlement</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Recomputation of participant's annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a former spouse of a retired participant dies or remarries before attaining age 55, the annuity of the retired participant, if reduced to provide a survivor annuity for that former spouse, shall be recomputed and paid, effective on the first day of the month beginning after such death or remarriage, as if the annuity had not been so reduced, unless an election is in effect under subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Election of spouse annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to paragraph (4)(B), the participant may elect in writing within one year after receipt of notice of the death or remarriage of the former spouse to continue the reduction in order to provide a higher survivor annuity under section 2031(b)(3) of this title for any spouse of the participant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Optional additional survivor annuities for other former spouse or surviving spouse</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any participant providing a survivor annuity under subsection (b) of this section for a former spouse&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such participant may elect, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a spousal agreement or court order under section 2094(b) of this title may provide for,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:317 --><p class="statutory-body-block-1em">an additional survivor annuity under this subsection for any other former spouse or spouse surviving the participant, if the participant satisfactorily passes a physical examination as prescribed by the Director.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Neither the total amount of survivor annuity or annuities under this subsection with respect to any participant, nor the survivor annuity or annuities for any one surviving spouse or former spouse of such participant under this section or section 2031 of this title, may exceed 55 percent of the unreduced amount of the participant's annuity, as computed under section 2031(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Contribution for additional annuities</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Provision of additional survivor annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In accordance with regulations which the Director shall prescribe, the participant involved may provide for any annuity under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) by a reduction in the annuity or an allotment from the basic pay of the participant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by a lump-sum payment or installment payments to the fund; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) by any combination thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Actuarial equivalence to benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The present value of the total amount to accrue to the fund under subparagraph (A) to provide any annuity under this subsection shall be actuarially equivalent in value to such annuity, as calculated upon such tables of mortality as may from time to time be prescribed for this purpose by the Director.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Effect of former spouse's death or disqualification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a former spouse predeceases the participant or remarries before attaining age 55 (or, in the case of a spouse, the spouse predeceases the participant or does not qualify as a former spouse upon dissolution of the marriage)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if an annuity reduction or pay allotment under subparagraph (A) is in effect for that spouse or former spouse, the annuity shall be recomputed and paid as if it had not been reduced or the pay allotment terminated, as the case may be; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any amount accruing to the fund under subparagraph (A) shall be refunded, but only to the extent that such amount may have exceeded the actuarial cost of providing benefits under this subsection for the period such benefits were provided, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Director.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Recomputation upon death or remarriage of former spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Under regulations prescribed by the Director, an annuity shall be recomputed (or a pay allotment terminated or adjusted), and a refund provided (if appropriate), in a manner comparable to that provided under subparagraph (C), in order to reflect a termination or reduction of future benefits under this subsection for a spouse in the event a former spouse of the participant dies or remarries before attaining age 55 and an increased annuity is provided for that spouse in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Commencement and termination of additional survivor annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An annuity payable under this subsection to a spouse or former spouse shall commence on the day after the participant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before the spouse's or the former spouse's death or remarriage before attaining age 55.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2051. Retirement for disability or incapacity; medical examination; recovery</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Disability retirement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A participant who has become disabled shall, upon the participant's own application or upon order of the Director, be retired on an annuity computed under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Standard for disability determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A participant shall be considered to be disabled only if the participant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is found by the Director to be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the participant's position; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is not qualified for reassignment, under procedures prescribed by the Director, to a vacant position in the Agency at the same grade or level and in which the participant would be able to render useful and efficient service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Time limit for application</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) One year requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A claim may be allowed under this section only if the application is submitted before the participant is separated from the Agency or within one year thereafter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Waiver for mentally incompetent participant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The time limitation may be waived by the Director for a participant who, at the date of separation from the Agency or within one year thereafter, is mentally incompetent, if the application is filed with the Agency within one year from the date of restoration of the participant to competency or the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation of disability annuity</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), an annuity payable under subsection (a) of this section shall be computed under section 2031(a) of this title. However, if the disabled or incapacitated participant has less than 20 years of service credit toward retirement under the system at the time of retirement, the annuity shall be computed on the assumption that the participant has had 20 years of service, but the additional service credit that may accrue to a participant under this paragraph may not exceed the difference between the participant's age at the time of retirement and age 60.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Coordination with military retired pay and veterans&rsquo; compensation and pension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a participant retiring under this section is receiving retired pay or retainer pay for military service (except that specified in section 2082(e)(3) of this title) or Department of Veterans Affairs compensation or pension in lieu of such retired or retainer pay, the annuity of that participant shall be computed under section 2031(a) of this title, excluding credit for <!-- PDFPage:323 -->such military service from that computation. If the amount of the annuity so computed, plus the retired or retainer pay which is received, or which would be received but for the application of the limitation in section 5532&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2051_1_target" name="2051_1">1</a></sup> of title 5, or the Department of Veterans Affairs compensation or pension in lieu of such retired or retainer pay, is less than the annuity that would be payable under this section in the absence of the previous sentence, an amount equal to the difference shall be added to the annuity payable under section 2031(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Medical examinations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Medical examination required for determination of disability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In each case, the participant shall be given a medical examination by one or more duly qualified physicians or surgeons designated by the Director to conduct examinations, and disability shall be determined by the Director on the basis of the advice of such physicians or surgeons.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual reexaminations until age 60</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Unless the disability is permanent, like examinations shall be made annually until the annuitant becomes age 60. If the Director determines on the basis of the advice of one or more duly qualified physicians or surgeons conducting such examinations that an annuitant has recovered to the extent that the annuitant can return to duty, the annuitant may apply for reinstatement or reappointment in the Agency within one year from the date the annuitant's recovery is determined.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reinstatement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon application, the Director may reinstate any such recovered disability annuitant in the grade held at time of retirement, or the Director may, taking into consideration the age, qualifications, and experience of such annuitant, and the present grade of the annuitant's contemporaries in the Agency, appoint the annuitant to a grade higher than the one held before retirement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Termination of disability annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Payment of the annuity shall continue until a date one year after the date of examination showing recovery or until the date of reinstatement or reappointment in the Agency, whichever is earlier.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Payment of fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Fees for examinations under this subsection, together with reasonable traveling and other expenses incurred in order to submit to examination, may be paid out of the fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Suspension of annuity pending required examination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the annuitant fails to submit to examination as required under this section, payment of the annuity shall be suspended until continuance of the disability is satisfactorily established.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Termination of annuity upon restoration of earning capacity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the annuitant receiving a disability retirement annuity is restored to earning capacity before becoming age 60, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment by the Government or 180 days after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity is restored, whichever is earlier. Earning capacity shall be considered to be restored if in any calendar year the income of the annuitant from wages or self-employment, or both, equals at least 80 percent of the current rate of pay for the grade and step the annuitant held at the time of retirement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Treatment of recovered disability annuitant who is not reinstated</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Separation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a recovered or restored disability annuitant whose annuity is discontinued is for any reason not reinstated or reappointed in the Agency, the annuitant shall be considered, except for service credit, to have been separated within the meaning of section 2054 of this title as of the date of termination of the disability annuity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Retirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After such termination, the recovered or restored annuitant shall be entitled to the benefits of section 2054 or 2071(a) of this title, except that the annuitant may elect voluntary retirement under section 2053 of this title, if qualified thereunder, or may be placed by the Director in an involuntary retirement status under section 2055(a) of this title, if qualified thereunder. Retirement rights under this paragraph shall be based on the provisions of this subchapter in effect as of the date on which the disability annuity is discontinued.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Further disability before age 62</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, based on a current medical examination, the Director determines that a recovered annuitant has, before reaching age 62, again become totally disabled due to recurrence of the disability for which the annuitant was originally retired, the annuitant's terminated disability annuity (same type and rate) shall be reinstated from the date of such medical examination. If a restored-to-earning-capacity annuitant has not medically recovered from the disability for which retired and establishes to the Director's satisfaction that the annuitant's income from wages and self-employment in any calendar year before reaching age 62 was less than 80 percent of the rate of pay for the grade and step the annuitant held at the time of retirement, the annuitant's terminated disability annuity (same type and rate) shall be reinstated from the first of the next following year. If the annuitant has been allowed an involuntary or voluntary retirement annuity in the meantime, the annuitant's reinstated disability annuity shall be substituted for it unless the annuitant elects to retain the former benefit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Coordination of benefits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Workers&rsquo; compensation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A participant is not entitled to receive for the same period of time&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:324 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an annuity under this subchapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) compensation for injury to, or disability of, such participant under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5, other than compensation payable under section 8107 of such title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Survivor annuities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An individual is not entitled to receive an annuity under this subchapter and a concurrent benefit under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5 on account of the death of the same person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Greater benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not bar the right of a claimant to the greater benefit conferred by either this subchapter or subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Offset from survivor annuity for workers&rsquo; compensation payment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Refund to Department of Labor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an individual is entitled to an annuity under this subchapter and the individual receives a lump-sum payment for compensation under section 8135 of title 5 based on the disability or death of the same person, so much of the compensation as has been paid for a period extended beyond the date payment of the annuity commences, as determined by the Secretary of Labor, shall be refunded to the Department for credit to the Employees&rsquo; Compensation Fund. Before the individual may receive the annuity, the individual shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) refund to the Secretary of Labor the amount representing the commuted compensation payments for the extended period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) authorize the deduction of the amount from the annuity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Source of deduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Deductions from the annuity may be made from accrued or accruing payments. The amounts deducted and withheld from the annuity shall be transmitted to the Secretary for reimbursement to the Employees&rsquo; Compensation Fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Prorating deduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary finds that the financial circumstances of an individual entitled to an annuity under this subchapter warrant deferred refunding, deductions from the annuity may be prorated against and paid from accruing payments in such manner as the Secretary determines appropriate.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Entitlement to lump-sum credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to section 2082(d) of this title and subsection (b) of this section, a participant who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is separated from the Agency for at least 31 consecutive days and is not transferred to employment covered by another retirement system for Government employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) files an application with the Director for payment of the lump-sum credit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is not reemployed in a position in which the participant is subject to this subchapter at the time the participant files the application; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) will not become eligible to receive an annuity under this subchapter within 31 days after filing the application,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">is entitled to be paid the lump-sum credit. Receipt of the payment of the lump-sum credit by the former participant voids all annuity rights under this subchapter based on the service on which the lump-sum credit is based, until the former participant is reemployed in service subject to this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions for payment of lump-sum credit</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever a former participant becomes entitled to receive payment of the lump-sum credit under subsection (a) of this section, such lump-sum credit shall be paid to the former participant and to any former spouse or former wife or husband of the former participant in accordance with paragraphs (2) through (4). The former participant's lump-sum credit shall be reduced by the amount of the lump-sum credit payable to any former spouse or former wife or husband.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Pro rata share for former spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Unless otherwise expressly provided by any spousal agreement or court order under section 2094(b) of this title, a former spouse of the former participant shall be entitled to receive a share of such participant's lump-sum credit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if married to the participant throughout the period of creditable service of the participant, equal to 50 percent of such lump-sum credit; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if not married to the participant throughout such creditable service, equal to a proportion of 50 percent of such lump-sum credit which is the proportion that the number of days of the marriage of the former spouse to the participant during periods of creditable service of such participant bears to the total number of days of such creditable service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Share for former wife or husband</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Payment of the former participant's lump-sum credit shall be subject to the terms of a court order under section 2094(c) of this title concerning any former wife or husband of the former participant if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the court order expressly relates to any portion of such lump-sum credit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) payment of the lump-sum credit would extinguish entitlement of such former wife or husband to a survivor annuity under section 2036 of this title or to any portion of the participant's annuity under section 2094(c) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A lump-sum credit may be paid to or for the benefit of a former participant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) only upon written notification to (i) the current spouse, if any, (ii) any former spouse, and (iii) any former wife or husband who has a court order covered by paragraph (3); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) only if the express written concurrence of the current spouse has been received by the Director.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">This paragraph may be waived under circumstances described in section 2031(b)(1)(D) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Order of precedence of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A lump-sum payment authorized by subsection (d) or (e) of this section 2121(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2071_1_target" name="2071_1">1</a></sup> of this title and a payment of any accrued and unpaid annuity authorized by subsection (f) of this section shall be paid in the following order of precedence to individuals surviving the participant and alive on the date entitlement to the payment arises, upon establishment of a valid claim therefor, and such payment bars recovery by any other individual:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by such participant in a signed and witnessed writing received by the Director before the participant's death. For this purpose, a designation, change, or cancellation of beneficiary in a will or other document not so executed and filed with the Director shall have no force or effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If there is no designated beneficiary, to the surviving wife or husband of such participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If none of the above, to the child or children of such participant and descendent of deceased children by representation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If none of the above, to the parents of such participant or the survivor of them.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) If none of the above, to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of such participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) If none of the above, to such other next of kin of such participant as the Director determines to be legally entitled to such payment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Death of former participant before retirement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), if a former participant eligible for a deferred an<!-- PDFPage:328 -->nuity under section 2054 of this title dies before reaching age 62, such former participant's lump-sum credit shall be paid in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case where there is a surviving former spouse or surviving former wife or husband of such participant who is entitled to a share of such participant's lump-sum credit under paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (b) of this section, the lump-sum credit payable under paragraph (1) shall be reduced by the lump-sum credit payable to such former spouse or former wife or husband.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Termination of all annuity rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If all annuity rights under this subchapter based on the service of a deceased participant or annuitant terminate before the total annuity paid equals the lump-sum credit, the difference shall be paid in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Payment of accrued and unpaid annuity when retired participant dies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a retired participant dies, any annuity accrued and unpaid shall be paid in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Termination of survivor annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An annuity accrued and unpaid on the termination, except by death, of the annuity of a survivor annuitant shall be paid to that individual. An annuity accrued and unpaid on the death of a survivor annuitant shall be paid in the following order of precedence, and the payment bars recovery by any other individual:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of the survivor annuitant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If there is no executor or administrator, to such next of kin of the survivor annuitant as the Director determines to be legally entitled to such payment, except that no payment shall be made under this paragraph until after the expiration of 30 days from the date of death of the survivor annuitant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall be computed in accordance with section 8332(c)(3) of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Effect of entitlement to social security benefits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section (except paragraph (3) of this subsection) or section 2083 of this title, any military service (other than military service covered by military leave with pay from a civilian position) performed by a participant after December 1956 shall be excluded in determining the aggregate period of service on which an annuity payable under this subchapter to such participant or to the participant's spouse, former spouse, previous spouse, or child is based, if such participant, spouse, former spouse, previous spouse, or child is entitled (or would upon proper application be entitled), at the time of such determination, to monthly old-age or survivors&rsquo; insurance benefits under section 402 of title 42, based on such participant's wages and self-employment income. If the military service is not excluded under the preceding sentence, but upon attaining age 62, the participant or spouse, former spouse, or previous spouse becomes entitled (or would upon proper application be entitled) to such benefits, the aggregate period of service on which the annuity is based shall be redetermined, effective as of the first day of the month in which the participant or spouse, former spouse, or previous spouse attains age 62, so as to exclude such service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of paragraph (1) relating to credit for military service do not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any period of military service of a participant with respect to which the participant has made a deposit with interest, if any, under subsection (h) of this section; or</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect of entitlement before September 8, 1982</h4>

Instead of an annuity recomputation, the annuity of such participant shall be reduced at age 62 by an amount equal to a fraction of the participant's old-age or survivors&rsquo; insurance benefits under section 402 of title 42. The reduction shall be determined by multiplying the participant's monthly Social Security benefit by a fraction, the numerator of which is the participant's total military wages and deemed additional wages (within the meaning of section 429 of title 42) that were subject to Social Security deductions and the denominator of which is the total of all the participant's wages, including military wages, and all self-employment income that were subject to Social Security deductions before the calendar year in which the determination month occurs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The reduction determined in accordance with subparagraph (A) shall not be greater than the reduction that would be required under paragraph (1) if such paragraph applied to the participant. The new formula shall be applicable to any annuity payment payable after October 1, 1982, including annuity payments to participants who had previously reached age 62 and whose annuities had already been recomputed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;determination month&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the first month for which the participant is entitled to old-age or survivors&rsquo; insurance benefits (or would be entitled to such benefits upon application therefor); or</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Agreements with States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall, in accordance with this subsection, enter into an agreement with any State within 120 days of a request for agreement from the proper State official. The agreement shall provide that the Director shall withhold State income tax in the case of the monthly annuity of any annuitant who voluntarily requests, in writing, such withholding. The amounts withheld during any calendar quarter shall be held in the Fund&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2093_1_target" name="2093_1">1</a></sup> and disbursed to the States during the month following that calendar quarter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation on multiple requests</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Change in State designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (2), an annuitant may change the State designated by that annuitant for purposes of having withholdings made, and may request that the withholdings be remitted in accordance with such change. An annuitant also may revoke any request of that annuitant for withholding. Any change in the State designated or revocation is effective on the first day of the month after the month in which the request or the revocation is processed by the Director, but in no event later than on the first day of the second month beginning after the day on which such request or revocation is received by the Director.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) General provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection does not give the consent of the United States to the application of a statute which imposes more burdensome requirements of the United States than on employers generally, or which subjects the United States or any annuitant to a penalty or liability because of this subsection. The Director may not accept pay from a State for services performed in withholding State income taxes from annuities. Any amount erroneously withheld from <!-- PDFPage:334 -->an annuity and paid to a State by the Director shall be repaid by the State in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Director.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A cost-of-living increase made under paragraph (1) shall become effective under this section on the effective date of each such increase under section 8340(b) of title 5.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Eligibility for an annuity increase under this section shall be governed by the commencing date of each annuity payable from the fund as of the effective date of an increase, except as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The first cost-of-living increase (if any) made under subsection (a) of this section to an annuity which is payable from the fund to a participant who retires, to the surviving spouse, former spouse, or previous spouse of a participant who dies in service, or to the surviving spouse, former spouse, previous spouse, or insurable interest designee of a deceased annuitant whose annuity has not been increased under this subsection or subsection (a) of this section, shall be equal to the product (adjusted to the nearest 1/10 of one percent) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 1/12 of the applicable percent change computed under subsection (a) of this section, multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of months (not to exceed 12 months, counting any portion of a month as a month)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for which the annuity was payable from the fund before the effective date of the increase, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a surviving spouse, former spouse, previous spouse, or insurable interest designee of a deceased annuitant whose annuity has not been so increased, since the annuity was first payable to the deceased annuitant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Effective from its commencing date, an annuity payable from the fund to an annuitant's survivor (other than a child entitled to an annuity under section 2031(d) of this title) shall be increased by the total percentage increase the annuitant was receiving under this section at death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) For purposes of computing the annuity of a child under section 2031(d) of this title that commences after October 31, 1969, the dollar amounts specified in section 2031(d)(3) of this title shall each be increased by the total percentage increases allowed and in force under this section on or after such day and, in the case of a deceased annuitant, the percentages specified in that section shall be increased by the total percent allowed and in force to the annuitant under this section on or after such day.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the final pay (or average pay, if higher) of the participant with respect to whom the annuity is paid, increased by the overall annual average percentage adjustments (compounded) in the rates of pay of the General Schedule under subchapter I of chapter 53 of title 5 during the period&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) beginning on the date on which the annuity commenced (or, in the case of a survivor of the retired participant, the date on which the participant's annuity commenced), and</p>
