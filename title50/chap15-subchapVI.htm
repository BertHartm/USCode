<p class="statutory-body">(a) Not later than 180 days after October 14, 1994, the President shall, by Executive order or regulation, establish procedures to govern access to classified information which shall be binding upon all departments, agencies, and offices of the executive branch of Government. Such procedures shall, at a minimum&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provide that, except as may be permitted by the President, no employee in the executive branch of Government may be given access to classified information by any department, agency, or office of the executive branch of Government unless, based upon an appropriate background investigation, such access is determined to be clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establish uniform minimum requirements governing the scope and frequency of background investigations and reinvestigations for all employees in the executive branch of Government who require access to classified information as part of their official responsibilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide that all employees in the executive branch of Government who require access to classified information shall be required as a condition of such access to provide to the employing department or agency written consent which permits access by an authorized investigative agency to relevant financial records, other financial information, consumer reports, and travel records, as determined by the President, in accordance with section 436 of this title, during the period of access to classified information and for a period of three years thereafter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide that all employees in the executive branch of Government who require access to particularly sensitive classified information, as determined by the President, shall be required, as a condition of maintaining access to such information, to submit to the employing department or agency, during the period of such access, relevant information concerning their financial condition and foreign travel, as determined by the President, as may be necessary to ensure appropriate security; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) establish uniform minimum standards to ensure that employees in the executive branch of Government whose access to classified information is being denied or terminated under this subchapter are appropriately advised of the reasons for such denial or termination and are provided an adequate opportunity to respond to all adverse information which forms the basis for such denial or termination before final action by the department or agency concerned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Subsection (a) of this section shall not be deemed to limit or affect the responsibility and power of an agency head pursuant to other law or Executive order to deny or terminate access to classified information if the national security so requires. Such responsibility and power may be exercised only when the agency head determines that the procedures prescribed <!-- PDFPage:112 -->by subsection (a) of this section cannot be invoked in a manner that is consistent with the national security.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon the exercise of such responsibility, the agency head shall submit a report to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 103&ndash;236, title IX, Apr. 30, 1994, 108 Stat. 525, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 901. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This title may be cited as the &lsquo;Protection and Reduction of Government Secrecy Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 902. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) During the Cold War an extensive secrecy system developed which limited public access to information and reduced the ability of the public to participate with full knowledge in the process of governmental decisionmaking.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In 1992 alone 6,349,532 documents were classified and approximately three million persons held some form of security clearance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The burden of managing more than 6 million newly classified documents every year has led to tremendous administrative expense, reduced communication within the government and within the scientific community, reduced communication between the government and the people of the United States, and the selective and unauthorized public disclosure of classified information.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) It has been estimated that private businesses spend more than $14 billion each year implementing government mandated regulations for protecting classified information.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) If a smaller amount of truly sensitive information were classified the information could be held more securely.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In 1970 a Task Force organized by the Defense Science Board and headed by Dr. Frederick Seitz concluded that &lsquo;more might be gained than lost if our Nation were to adopt&mdash;unilaterally, if necessary&mdash;a policy of complete openness in all areas of information&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The procedures for granting security clearances have themselves become an expensive and inefficient part of the secrecy system and should be closely examined.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) A bipartisan study commission specially constituted for the purpose of examining the consequences of the secrecy system will be able to offer comprehensive proposals for reform.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 903. PURPOSE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the purpose of this title to establish for a two-year period a Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to examine the implications of the extensive classification of information and to make recommendations to reduce the volume of information classified and thereby to strengthen the protection of legitimately classified information; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to examine and make recommendations concerning current procedures relating to the granting of security clearances.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 904. COMPOSITION OF THE COMMISSION.</h4>

<p class="note-body">(2) The head of the department concerned or his special designee for that particular purpose has preliminarily determined, after considering information furnished by the investigative agency involved as to the reliability of the person and the accuracy of the statement concerned, that the statement concerned appears to be reliable and material, and the head of the department or such special designee has determined that failure to receive and consider such statement would, in view of the level of access sought, be substantially harmful to the national security and that the person who furnished the information cannot appear to testify (A) due to death, severe illness, or similar cause, in which case the identity of the person and the information to be considered shall be made available to the applicant, or (B) due to some other cause determined by the head of the department to be good and sufficient.</p>

In every such case, information as to the authenticity and accuracy of such physical evidence furnished by the investigative agency involved shall be considered. In such instances a final determination adverse to the applicant shall be made only by the head of the department based upon his personal review of the case.</p>

If a person so invited is an officer or employee of the executive branch of the government or a member of the armed forces of the United States, the head of the department or agency concerned shall cooperate in making that person available for cross-examination.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. Any determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. Except as otherwise specified in the preceding provisions of this order, any authority vested in the head of a department by this order may be delegated to the the [sic] deputy of that department, or the principal assistant to the head of that department, as the case may be.</p>

Information may not be classified under this Order unless its disclosure reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security.</p>

<p class="note-body">(c) If there is reasonable doubt about the need to classify information, it shall be safeguarded as if it were classified pending a determination by an original classification authority, who shall make this determination within thirty (30) days. If there is reasonable doubt about the appropriate level of classification, it shall be safeguarded at the higher level of classification pending a determination by an original classification authority, who shall make this determination within thirty (30) days.</p>

Any determination made under this subsection shall be reported promptly to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Information that is determined to concern one or more of the categories in Section 1.3(a) shall be classified when an original classification authority also determines that its unauthorized disclosure, either by itself or in the context of other information, reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security.</p>

Omitted markings may be inserted on a document by the officials specified in Section 3.1(b).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Sec. 1.6 Limitations on Classification</h4>
<p class="note-body">(a) In no case shall information be classified in order to conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error; to prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency; to restrain competition; or to prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection in the interest of national security.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Basic scientific research information not clearly related to the national security may not be classified.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The President or an agency head or official designated under Sections 1.2(a)(2), 1.2(b)(1), or 1.2(c)(1) may reclassify information previously declassified and disclosed if it is determined in writing that (1) the information requires protection in the interest of national security; and (2) the information may reasonably be recovered.

<p class="note-body">WHEREAS, the Senate, by S. Res. 324 of July 2, 1992, has asked that I &ldquo;expeditiously issue an Executive order requiring all executive branch departments and agencies to declassify and publicly release without compromising United States national security all documents, files, and other materials pertaining to POWs and MIAs;&rdquo; and</p>
<p class="note-body">WHEREAS, indiscriminate release of classified material could jeopardize continuing United States Government efforts to achieve the fullest possible accounting of Vietnam-era POWs and MIAs; and</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 12829. National Industrial Security Program</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12829, Jan. 6, 1993, 58 F.R. 3479, as amended by Ex. Ord. No. 12885, Dec. 14, 1993, 58 F.R. 65863, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">This order establishes a National Industrial Security Program to safeguard Federal Government classified information that is released to contractors, licensees, and grantees of the United States Government. To promote our national interests, the United States Government issues contracts, licenses, and grants to nongovernment organizations. When these arrangements require access to classified information, the national security requires that this information be safeguarded in a manner equivalent to its protection within the executive branch of Government. The national security also requires that our industrial security program promote the economic and technological interests of the United States. Redundant, overlapping, or unnecessary requirements impede those interests. Therefore, the National Industrial Security Program shall serve as a single, integrated, cohesive industrial security program to protect classified information and to preserve our Nation's economic and technological interests.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2011&ndash;2286) [42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.], the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (codified as amended in scattered sections of the United States Code) [see Short Title note set out under section 401 of this title], and the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C.

The purpose of this program is to safeguard classified information that may be released or has been released to current, prospective, or former contractors, licensees, or grantees of United States agencies. For the purposes of this order, the terms &ldquo;contractor, licensee, or grantee&rdquo; means current, prospective, or former contractors, licensees, or grantees of United States agencies. The National Industrial Security Program shall be applicable to all executive branch departments and agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The National Industrial Security Program shall provide for the protection of information classified pursuant to Executive Order No. 12356 of April 2, 1982 [set out above], or its successor, and the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended [42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.].</p>

<p class="note-body">(4) have the authority, pursuant to terms of applicable contracts, licenses, grants, or regulations, to conduct on-site reviews of the implementation of the National Industrial Security Program by each agency, contractor, licensee, and grantee that has access to or stores classified information and to require of each agency, contractor, licensee, and grantee those reports, information, and other cooperation that may be necessary to fulfill the Director's responsibilities. If these reports, inspections, or access to specific classified information, or other forms of cooperation, would pose an exceptional national security risk, the affected agency head or the senior official designated under section 203(a) of this order may request the National Security Council to deny access to the Director. The Director shall not have access pending a prompt decision by the National Security Council;</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) report any violations of this order or its implementing directives to the head of the agency or to the senior official designated under section 203(a) of this order so that corrective action, if appropriate, may be taken.

<p class="note-body">(8) report at least annually to the President through the National Security Council on the implementation of the National Industrial Security Program.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Nothing in this order shall be construed to supersede the authority of the Secretary of Energy or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended [42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.], or the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence under the National Security Act of 1947, as amended [see Short Title note set out under section 401 of this title], or Executive Order No. 12333 of December 8, 1981 [50 U.S.C. 401 note].</p>

There is established the National Industrial Security Program Policy Advisory Committee (&ldquo;Committee&rdquo;). The Director of the Information Security Oversight Office shall serve as Chairman of the Committee and appoint the members of the Committee.
