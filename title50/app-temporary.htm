<p class="note-body">Sections 806 to 810 were omitted as terminated pursuant to section 814 of this Appendix.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 806, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, &sect;1, 56 Stat. 463, suspended the provisions of existing law relating to periodic computations for the purpose of determining the authorized number of commissioned officers in the various grades of the line of the Regular Navy and of the Marine Corps, the permanent promotion or advancement of all officers of the Navy and Marine Corps, <!-- PDFPage:127 -->and the involuntary retirement or honorable discharge of such officers by reason of failure of selection or upon completion of designated periods of service. Under section 813 of this Appendix, this section also applied to officer personnel of the Coast Guard. This section was repealed insofar as it related to the Navy and Marine Corps by act Aug. 7, 1947, ch. 512, title IV, &sect;426(a), 61 Stat. 880. It was superseded with respect to the Coast Guard by section 42 of Title 14, Coast Guard.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 807, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, &sect;2, 56 Stat. 464, related to the number of rear admirals entitled to pay and allowances of rear admirals of the upper half. It was repealed insofar as it related to the Navy and Marine Corps by act Aug. 7, 1947, ch. 512, title IV, &sect;426(a), 61 Stat. 880, and superseded with respect to the Coast Guard by section 462 of former Title 14, Coast Guard, which is covered by section 202 of Title 37, Pay and Allowances of the Uniformed Services.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 808, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, &sect;3, 56 Stat. 464, provided for modification of age limits for original appointments to commissioned rank in staff corps.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 809, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, &sect;4, 56 Stat. 464, which was an amendment of provisions concerning appointment of certain reserve officers to regular Navy or Marine Corps, was a permanent provision under section 814 of this Appendix, and was set out as sections 737a and 853c&ndash;2a of former Title 34, Navy, which were repealed by act Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, &sect;53, 70A Stat. 641. See sections 2104, 2106, and 6914 of Title 10, Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 810, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, &sect;5, 56 Stat. 465, related to temporarily promoted officers, pay and allowances, and date of acceptance of appointment. It was repealed insofar as it related to the Navy and Marine Corps by act Aug. 7, 1947, ch. 512, title IV, &sect;426(a), 61 Stat. 880, and reenacted as section 350k of former Title 34, Navy, by act May 22, 1950, ch. 193, &sect;3, 64 Stat. 187. Although section 810 applied to the Coast Guard under section 813 of this Appendix, it was superseded in this respect by section 350k of Title 34, which applied to the Coast Guard under section 350j of former Title 34. Sections 350j and 350k of former Title 34 were repealed by act Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, &sect;53, 70A Stat. 641, and replaced by sections 5597 and 5787 of Title 10, Armed Forces, section 351 of Title 14, Coast Guard, and section 212(f) of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare.</p>

<p class="note-body">Sections 812 to 814 were omitted as terminated pursuant to section 814 of this Appendix.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 812, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, &sect;7, 56 Stat. 465, amended sections 350 and 350i of former Title 34, Navy. It was repealed insofar as it related to the Navy and Marine Corps by act Aug. 7, 1947, ch. 512, title IV, &sect;426(a), 61 Stat. 880. It was superseded with respect to the Coast Guard by act June 3, 1948, ch. 395, 62 Stat. 302.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 813, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, &sect;8, 56 Stat. 465, provided: &ldquo;The provisions of this Act [sections 806 to 814 of this Appendix] except as may be necessary to adapt the said provisions to the Coast Guard, shall apply to officer personnel of the Coast Guard in like manner and to the same extent and with the same relative conditions in all respects as are provided for the officer personnel of the Navy and Marine Corps.&rdquo; It appears that section 808 of this Appendix does not apply to the Coast Guard since it has no staff officers and that section 809 does not apply because it amends provisions relating only to the Navy and Marine Corps. As pointed out in notes under sections 806, 807, 810, and 812, they have been superseded with respect to the Coast Guard.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 814, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, &sect;9, 56 Stat. 465, prohibited any reduction of pay by virtue of sections 806 to 814 of this Appendix, and provided for termination of sections 806 to 814 of this Appendix on June 30 of fiscal year following that in which World War II ended. See Termination of State of War notes preceding section 1, of this Appendix. See note for former section 809 of this Appendix for its disposition, such section having been excepted from the termination provisions.</p>
