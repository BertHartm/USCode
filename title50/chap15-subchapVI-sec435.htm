<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establish uniform minimum requirements governing the scope and frequency of background investigations and reinvestigations for all employees in the executive branch of Government who require access to classified information as part of their official responsibilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide that all employees in the executive branch of Government who require access to classified information shall be required as a condition of such access to provide to the employing department or agency written consent which permits access by an authorized investigative agency to relevant financial records, other financial information, consumer reports, travel records, and computers used in the performance of Government duties, as determined by the President, in accordance with section 436 of this title, during the period of access to classified information and for a period of three years thereafter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide that all employees in the executive branch of Government who require access to particularly sensitive classified information, as determined by the President, shall be required, as a condition of maintaining access to such information, to submit to the employing department or agency, during the period of such access, relevant information concerning their financial condition and foreign travel, as determined by the President, as may be necessary to ensure appropriate security; and</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 901. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This title may be cited as the &lsquo;Protection and Reduction of Government Secrecy Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 902. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) During the Cold War an extensive secrecy system developed which limited public access to information and reduced the ability of the public to participate with full knowledge in the process of governmental decisionmaking.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In 1992 alone 6,349,532 documents were classified and approximately three million persons held some form of security clearance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The burden of managing more than 6 million newly classified documents every year has led to tremendous administrative expense, reduced communication within the government and within the scientific community, reduced communication between the government and the people of the United States, and the selective and unauthorized public disclosure of classified information.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) It has been estimated that private businesses spend more than $14 billion each year implementing government mandated regulations for protecting classified information.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) If a smaller amount of truly sensitive information were classified the information could be held more securely.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In 1970 a Task Force organized by the Defense Science Board and headed by Dr. Frederick Seitz concluded that &lsquo;more might be gained than lost if our Nation were to adopt&mdash;unilaterally, if necessary&mdash;a policy of complete openness in all areas of information&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The procedures for granting security clearances have themselves become an expensive and inefficient part of the secrecy system and should be closely examined.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) A bipartisan study commission specially constituted for the purpose of examining the consequences of the secrecy system will be able to offer comprehensive proposals for reform.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 903. PURPOSE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the purpose of this title to establish for a two-year period a Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to examine the implications of the extensive classification of information and to make recommendations to reduce the volume of information clas<!-- PDFPage:187 -->sified and thereby to strengthen the protection of legitimately classified information; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to examine and make recommendations concerning current procedures relating to the granting of security clearances.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 904. COMPOSITION OF THE COMMISSION.</h4>

<p class="note-body">This order establishes a National Industrial Security Program to safeguard Federal Government classified information that is released to contractors, licensees, and grantees of the United States Government.

<p class="note-body">This order prescribes a uniform system for classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying national security information, including information relating to defense against transnational terrorism. Our democratic principles require that the American people be informed of the activities of their Government. Also, our Nation's progress depends on the free flow of information. Nevertheless, throughout our history, the national defense has required that certain information be maintained in confidence in order to protect our citizens, our democratic institutions, our homeland security, and our interactions with foreign nations. Protecting information critical to our Nation's security remains a priority.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 1&mdash;ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 1.1. <em>Classification Standards</em>. (a) Information may be originally classified under the terms of this order only if all of the following conditions are met:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) an original classification authority is classifying the information;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) the information is owned by, produced by or for, or is under the control of the United States Government;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) the information falls within one or more of the categories of information listed in section 1.4 of this order; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) the original classification authority determines that the unauthorized disclosure of the information reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security, which includes defense against transnational terrorism, and the original classification authority is able to identify or describe the damage.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Classified information shall not be declassified automatically as a result of any unauthorized disclosure of identical or similar information.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The unauthorized disclosure of foreign government information is presumed to cause damage to the national security.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 1.2. <em>Classification Levels</em>. (a) Information may be classified at one of the following three levels:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) &ldquo;Top Secret&rdquo; shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) &ldquo;Secret&rdquo; shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) &ldquo;Confidential&rdquo; shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Except as otherwise provided by statute, no other terms shall be used to identify United States classified information.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 1.3. <em>Classification Authority</em>. (a) The authority to classify information originally may be exercised only by:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) the President and, in the performance of executive duties, the Vice President;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) agency heads and officials designated by the President in the Federal Register; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) United States Government officials delegated this authority pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Officials authorized to classify information at a specified level are also authorized to classify information at a lower level.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Delegation of original classification authority.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Delegations of original classification authority shall be limited to the minimum required to administer this order. Agency heads are responsible for ensuring that designated subordinate officials have a demonstrable and continuing need to exercise this authority.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) &ldquo;Top Secret&rdquo; original classification authority may be delegated only by the President; in the performance of executive duties, the Vice President; or an agency head or official designated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) &ldquo;Secret&rdquo; or &ldquo;Confidential&rdquo; original classification authority may be delegated only by the President; in the performance of executive duties, the Vice President; or an agency head or official designated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section; or the senior agency official described in section 5.4(d) of this order, provided that official has been delegated &ldquo;Top Secret&rdquo; original classification authority by the agency head.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) Each delegation of original classification authority shall be in writing and the authority shall not be redelegated except as provided in this order. Each delegation shall identify the official by name or position title.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Original classification authorities must receive training in original classification as provided in this order and its implementing directives. Such training must include instruction on the proper safeguarding of classified information and of the criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions that may be brought against an individual who fails to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Exceptional cases. When an employee, government contractor, licensee, certificate holder, or grantee of an agency who does not have original classification authority originates information believed by that person to require classification, the information shall be protected in a manner consistent with this order and its implementing directives. The information shall be transmitted promptly as provided under this order or its implementing directives to the agency that has appropriate subject matter interest and classification authority with respect to this information. That agency shall decide within 30 days whether to classify this information. If it is not clear which agency has classification responsibility for this information, it shall be sent to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office. The Director shall determine the agency having primary subject matter interest and forward the information, with appropriate recommendations, to that agency for a classification determination.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 1.4. <em>Classification Categories</em>. Information shall not be considered for classification unless it concerns:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) military plans, weapons systems, or operations;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) foreign government information;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) intelligence activities (including special activities), intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology;</p>

<p class="note-body">(h) weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 1.5. <em>Duration of Classification</em>. (a) At the time of original classification, the original classification authority shall attempt to establish a specific date or event for declassification based upon the duration of the national security sensitivity of the information. Upon reaching the date or event, the information shall be automatically declassified. The date or event shall not exceed the time frame established in paragraph (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) If the original classification authority cannot determine an earlier specific date or event for declas<!-- PDFPage:197 -->sification, information shall be marked for declassification 10 years from the date of the original decision, unless the original classification authority otherwise determines that the sensitivity of the information requires that it shall be marked for declassification for up to 25 years from the date of the original decision. All information classified under this section shall be subject to section 3.3 of this order if it is contained in records of permanent historical value under title 44, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) An original classification authority may extend the duration of classification, change the level of classification, or reclassify specific information only when the standards and procedures for classifying information under this order are followed.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Information marked for an indefinite duration of classification under predecessor orders, for example, marked as &ldquo;Originating Agency's Determination Required,&rdquo; or information classified under predecessor orders that contains no declassification instructions shall be declassified in accordance with part 3 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 1.6. <em>Identification and Markings</em>. (a) At the time of original classification, the following shall appear on the face of each classified document, or shall be applied to other classified media in an appropriate manner:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) one of the three classification levels defined in section 1.2 of this order;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) the identity, by name or personal identifier and position, of the original classification authority;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) the agency and office of origin, if not otherwise evident;</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) declassification instructions, which shall indicate one of the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) the date or event for declassification, as prescribed in section 1.5(a) or section 1.5(c);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) the date that is 10 years from the date of original classification, as prescribed in section 1.5(b); or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(C) the date that is up to 25 years from the date of original classification, as prescribed in section 1.5(b); and</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) a concise reason for classification that, at a minimum, cites the applicable classification categories in section 1.4 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Specific information described in paragraph (a) of this section may be excluded if it would reveal additional classified information.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) With respect to each classified document, the agency originating the document shall, by marking or other means, indicate which portions are classified, with the applicable classification level, and which portions are unclassified. In accordance with standards prescribed in directives issued under this order, the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office may grant waivers of this requirement. The Director shall revoke any waiver upon a finding of abuse.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Markings implementing the provisions of this order, including abbreviations and requirements to safeguard classified working papers, shall conform to the standards prescribed in implementing directives issued pursuant to this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Foreign government information shall retain its original classification markings or shall be assigned a U.S. classification that provides a degree of protection at least equivalent to that required by the entity that furnished the information. Foreign government information retaining its original classification markings need not be assigned a U.S. classification marking provided that the responsible agency determines that the foreign government markings are adequate to meet the purposes served by U.S. classification markings.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Information assigned a level of classification under this or predecessor orders shall be considered as classified at that level of classification despite the omission of other required markings. Whenever such information is used in the derivative classification process or is reviewed for possible declassification, holders of such information shall coordinate with an appropriate classification authority for the application of omitted markings.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) The classification authority shall, whenever practicable, use a classified addendum whenever classified information constitutes a small portion of an otherwise unclassified document.</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) Prior to public release, all declassified records shall be appropriately marked to reflect their declassification.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 1.7. <em>Classification Prohibitions and Limitations.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) In no case shall information be classified in order to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) restrain competition; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection in the interest of the national security.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Basic scientific research information not clearly related to the national security shall not be classified.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Information may be reclassified after declassification and release to the public under proper authority only in accordance with the following conditions:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) the reclassification action is taken under the personal authority of the agency head or deputy agency head, who determines in writing that the reclassification of the information is necessary in the interest of the national security;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) the information may be reasonably recovered; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) the reclassification action is reported promptly to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Information that has not previously been disclosed to the public under proper authority may be classified or reclassified after an agency has received a request for it under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or the mandatory review provisions of section 3.5 of this order only if such classification meets the requirements of this order and is accomplished on a document-by-document basis with the personal participation or under the direction of the agency head, the deputy agency head, or the senior agency official designated under section 5.4 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Compilations of items of information that are individually unclassified may be classified if the compiled information reveals an additional association or relationship that: (1) meets the standards for classification under this order; and (2) is not otherwise revealed in the individual items of information. As used in this order, &ldquo;compilation&rdquo; means an aggregation of pre-existing unclassified items of information.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 1.8. <em>Classification Challenges</em>. (a) Authorized holders of information who, in good faith, believe that its classification status is improper are encouraged and expected to challenge the classification status of the information in accordance with agency procedures established under paragraph (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In accordance with implementing directives issued pursuant to this order, an agency head or senior agency official shall establish procedures under which authorized holders of information are encouraged and expected to challenge the classification of information that they believe is improperly classified or unclassified. These procedures shall ensure that:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) individuals are not subject to retribution for bringing such actions;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) an opportunity is provided for review by an impartial official or panel; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) individuals are advised of their right to appeal agency decisions to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (Panel) established by section 5.3 of this order.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 2&mdash;DERIVATIVE CLASSIFICATION</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.1. <em>Use of Derivative Classification</em>. (a) Persons who only reproduce, extract, or summarize classified information, or who only apply classification markings derived from source material or as directed by a classification guide, need not possess original classification authority.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Persons who apply derivative classification markings shall:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:198 --><p class="note-body">(1) observe and respect original classification decisions; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) carry forward to any newly created documents the pertinent classification markings. For information derivatively classified based on multiple sources, the derivative classifier shall carry forward:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) the date or event for declassification that corresponds to the longest period of classification among the sources; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) a listing of these sources on or attached to the official file or record copy.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.2. <em>Classification Guides</em>. (a) Agencies with original classification authority shall prepare classification guides to facilitate the proper and uniform derivative classification of information. These guides shall conform to standards contained in directives issued under this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Each guide shall be approved personally and in writing by an official who:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) has program or supervisory responsibility over the information or is the senior agency official; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) is authorized to classify information originally at the highest level of classification prescribed in the guide.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Agencies shall establish procedures to ensure that classification guides are reviewed and updated as provided in directives issued under this order.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 3&mdash;DECLASSIFICATION AND DOWNGRADING</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3.1. <em>Authority for Declassification</em>. (a) Information shall be declassified as soon as it no longer meets the standards for classification under this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) It is presumed that information that continues to meet the classification requirements under this order requires continued protection. In some exceptional cases, however, the need to protect such information may be outweighed by the public interest in disclosure of the information, and in these cases the information should be declassified. When such questions arise, they shall be referred to the agency head or the senior agency official. That official will determine, as an exercise of discretion, whether the public interest in disclosure outweighs the damage to the national security that might reasonably be expected from disclosure. This provision does not:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) amplify or modify the substantive criteria or procedures for classification; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) create any substantive or procedural rights subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) If the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office determines that information is classified in violation of this order, the Director may require the information to be declassified by the agency that originated the classification. Any such decision by the Director may be appealed to the President through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. The information shall remain classified pending a prompt decision on the appeal.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The provisions of this section shall also apply to agencies that, under the terms of this order, do not have original classification authority, but had such authority under predecessor orders.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3.2. <em>Transferred Records</em>. (a) In the case of classified records transferred in conjunction with a transfer of functions, and not merely for storage purposes, the receiving agency shall be deemed to be the originating agency for purposes of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In the case of classified records that are not officially transferred as described in paragraph (a) of this section, but that originated in an agency that has ceased to exist and for which there is no successor agency, each agency in possession of such records shall be deemed to be the originating agency for purposes of this order. Such records may be declassified or downgraded by the agency in possession after consultation with any other agency that has an interest in the subject matter of the records.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Classified records accessioned into the National Archives and Records Administration (National Archives) as of the effective date of this order shall be declassified or downgraded by the Archivist of the United States (Archivist) in accordance with this order, the directives issued pursuant to this order, agency declassification guides, and any existing procedural agreement between the Archivist and the relevant agency head.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The originating agency shall take all reasonable steps to declassify classified information contained in records determined to have permanent historical value before they are accessioned into the National Archives. However, the Archivist may require that classified records be accessioned into the National Archives when necessary to comply with the provisions of the Federal Records Act [see References in Text note set out under section 3603 of Title 44, Public Printing and Documents]. This provision does not apply to records being transferred to the Archivist pursuant to section 2203 of title 44, United States Code, or records for which the National Archives serves as the custodian of the records of an agency or organization that has gone out of existence.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) To the extent practicable, agencies shall adopt a system of records management that will facilitate the public release of documents at the time such documents are declassified pursuant to the provisions for automatic declassification in section 3.3 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3.3. <em>Automatic Declassification</em>. (a) Subject to paragraphs (b)&ndash;(e) of this section, on December 31, 2006, all classified records that (1) are more than 25 years old and (2) have been determined to have permanent historical value under title 44, United States Code, shall be automatically declassified whether or not the records have been reviewed. Subsequently, all classified records shall be automatically declassified on December 31 of the year that is 25 years from the date of its original classification, except as provided in paragraphs (b)&ndash;(e) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) An agency head may exempt from automatic declassification under paragraph (a) of this section specific information, the release of which could be expected to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) reveal the identity of a confidential human source, or a human intelligence source, or reveal information about the application of an intelligence source or method;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) reveal information that would assist in the development or use of weapons of mass destruction;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) reveal information that would impair U.S. cryptologic systems or activities;</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) reveal information that would impair the application of state of the art technology within a U.S. weapon system;</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) reveal actual U.S. military war plans that remain in effect;</p>
<p class="note-body">(6) reveal information, including foreign government information, that would seriously and demonstrably impair relations between the United States and a foreign government, or seriously and demonstrably undermine ongoing diplomatic activities of the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body">(7) reveal information that would clearly and demonstrably impair the current ability of United States Government officials to protect the President, Vice President, and other protectees for whom protection services, in the interest of the national security, are authorized;</p>
<p class="note-body">(8) reveal information that would seriously and demonstrably impair current national security emergency preparedness plans or reveal current vulnerabilities of systems, installations, infrastructures, or projects relating to the national security; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(9) violate a statute, treaty, or international agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) An agency head shall notify the President through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs of any specific file series of records for which a review or assessment has determined that the information within that file series almost invariably falls within one or more of the exemption categories listed in paragraph (b) of this section and which the agency pro<!-- PDFPage:199 -->poses to exempt from automatic declassification. The notification shall include:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) a description of the file series;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) an explanation of why the information within the file series is almost invariably exempt from automatic declassification and why the information must remain classified for a longer period of time; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) except for the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a specific date or event for declassification of the information. The President may direct the agency head not to exempt the file series or to declassify the information within that series at an earlier date than recommended. File series exemptions previously approved by the President shall remain valid without any additional agency action.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) At least 180 days before information is automatically declassified under this section, an agency head or senior agency official shall notify the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office, serving as Executive Secretary of the Panel, of any specific information beyond that included in a notification to the President under paragraph (c) of this section that the agency proposes to exempt from automatic declassification. The notification shall include:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) a description of the information, either by reference to information in specific records or in the form of a declassification guide;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) an explanation of why the information is exempt from automatic declassification and must remain classified for a longer period of time; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) except for the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a specific date or event for declassification of the information. The Panel may direct the agency not to exempt the information or to declassify it at an earlier date than recommended. The agency head may appeal such a decision to the President through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. The information will remain classified while such an appeal is pending.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The following provisions shall apply to the onset of automatic declassification:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Classified records within an integral file block, as defined in this order, that are otherwise subject to automatic declassification under this section shall not be automatically declassified until December 31 of the year that is 25 years from the date of the most recent record within the file block.</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 1.5. <em>Employee Education and Assistance</em>.

<p class="note-body">(b) inform employees about guidance and assistance available concerning issues that may affect their eligibility for access to classified information, including sources of assistance for employees who have questions or concerns about financial matters, mental health, or substance abuse.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 2&mdash;ACCESS ELIGIBILITY POLICY AND PROCEDURE</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.1. <em>Eligibility Determinations</em>. (a) Determinations of eligibility for access to classified information shall be based on criteria established under this order. Such determinations are separate from suitability determinations with respect to the hiring or retention of persons for employment by the government or any other personnel actions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The number of employees that each agency determines are eligible for access to classified information shall be kept to the minimum required for the conduct of agency functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Eligibility for access to classified information shall not be requested or granted solely to permit entry to, or ease of movement within, controlled areas when the employee has no need for access and access to classified information may reasonably be prevented. Where circumstances indicate employees may be inadvertently exposed to classified information in the course of their duties, agencies are authorized to grant or deny, in their discretion, facility access approvals to such employees based on an appropriate level of investigation as determined by each agency.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Except in agencies where eligibility for access is a mandatory condition of employment, eligibility for access to classified information shall only be requested or granted based on a demonstrated, foreseeable need for access. Requesting or approving eligibility in excess of actual requirements is prohibited.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Eligibility for access to classified information may be granted where there is a temporary need for access, such as one-time participation in a classified project, provided the investigative standards established under this order have been satisfied. In such cases, a fixed date or event for expiration shall be identified and access to classified information shall be limited to information related to the particular project or assignment.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) Access to classified information shall be terminated when an employee no longer has a need for access.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.2. <em>Level of Access Approval</em>. (a) The level at which an access approval is granted for an employee shall be limited, and relate directly, to the level of classified information for which there is a need for access. Eligibility for access to a higher level of classified information includes eligibility for access to information classified at a lower level.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Access to classified information relating to a special access program shall be granted in accordance with procedures established by the head of the agency that created the program or, for programs pertaining to intelligence activities (including special activities but not including military operational, strategic, and tactical programs) or intelligence sources and methods, by the Director of Central Intelligence. To the extent possible and consistent with the national security interests of the United States, such procedures shall be consistent with the standards and procedures established by and under this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.3. <em>Temporary Access to Higher Levels</em>. (a) An employee who has been determined to be eligible for access to classified information based on favorable adjudication of a completed investigation may be granted temporary access to a higher level where security personnel authorized by the agency head to make access eligibility determinations find that such access:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) is necessary to meet operational or contractual exigencies not expected to be of a recurring nature;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) will not exceed 180 days; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) is limited to specific, identifiable information that is made the subject of a written access record.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Where the access granted under subsection (a) of this section involves another agency's classified information, that agency must concur before access to its information is granted.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.4. <em>Reciprocal Acceptance of Access Eligibility Determinations</em>. (a) Except when an agency has substantial information indicating that an employee may not satisfy the standards in section 3.1 of this order, background investigations and eligibility determinations conducted under this order shall be mutually and reciprocally accepted by all agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Except where there is substantial information indicating that the employee may not satisfy the standards in section 3.1 of this order, an employee with existing access to a special access program shall not be denied eligibility for access to another special access program at the same sensitivity level as determined personally by the agency head or deputy agency head, or have an existing access eligibility readjudicated, so long as the employee has a need for access to the information involved.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This section shall not preclude agency heads from establishing additional, but not duplicative, investigative or adjudicative procedures for a special access pro<!-- PDFPage:208 -->gram or for candidates for detail or assignment to their agencies, where such procedures are required in exceptional circumstances to protect the national security.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Where temporary eligibility for access is granted under sections 2.3 or 3.3 of this order or where the determination of eligibility for access is conditional, the fact of such temporary or conditional access shall be conveyed to any other agency that considers affording the employee access to its information.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.5. <em>Specific Access Requirement</em>. (a) Employees who have been determined to be eligible for access to classified information shall be given access to classified information only where there is a need-to-know that information.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) It is the responsibility of employees who are authorized holders of classified information to verify that a prospective recipient's eligibility for access has been granted by an authorized agency official and to ensure that a need-to-know exists prior to allowing such access, and to challenge requests for access that do not appear well-founded.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.6. <em>Access by Non-United States Citizens</em>. (a) Where there are compelling reasons in furtherance of an agency mission, immigrant alien and foreign national employees who possess a special expertise may, in the discretion of the agency, be granted limited access to classified information only for specific programs, projects, contracts, licenses, certificates, or grants for which there is a need for access. Such individuals shall not be eligible for access to any greater level of classified information than the United States Government has determined may be releasable to the country of which the subject is currently a citizen, and such limited access may be approved only if the prior 10 years of the subject's life can be appropriately investigated. If there are any doubts concerning granting access, additional lawful investigative procedures shall be fully pursued.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Exceptions to these requirements may be permitted only by the agency head or the senior agency official designated under section 6.1 of this order to further substantial national security interests.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 3&mdash;ACCESS ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3.1. <em>Standards</em>. (a) No employee shall be deemed to be eligible for access to classified information merely by reason of Federal service or contracting, licensee, certificate holder, or grantee status, or as a matter of right or privilege, or as a result of any particular title, rank, position, or affiliation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Except as provided in sections 2.6 and 3.3 of this order, eligibility for access to classified information shall be granted only to employees who are United States citizens for whom an appropriate investigation has been completed and whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information. A determination of eligibility for access to such information is a discretionary security decision based on judgments by appropriately trained adjudicative personnel. Eligibility shall be granted only where facts and circumstances indicate access to classified information is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States, and any doubt shall be resolved in favor of the national security.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The United States Government does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or sexual orientation in granting access to classified information.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) In determining eligibility for access under this order, agencies may investigate and consider any matter that relates to the determination of whether access is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. No inference concerning the standards in this section may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the employee.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) No negative inference concerning the standards in this section may be raised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. Such counseling can be a positive factor in eligibility determinations. However, mental health counseling, where relevant to the adjudication of access to classified information, may justify further inquiry to determine whether the standards of subsection (b) of this section are satisfied, and mental health may be considered where it directly relates to those standards.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Not later than 180 days after the effective date of this order, the Security Policy Board shall develop a common set of adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, including access to special access programs.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3.2. <em>Basis for Eligibility Approval</em>. (a) Eligibility determinations for access to classified information shall be based on information concerning the applicant or employee that is acquired through the investigation conducted pursuant to this order or otherwise available to security officials and shall be made part of the applicant's or employee's security record. Applicants or employees shall be required to provide relevant information pertaining to their background and character for use in investigating and adjudicating their eligibility for access.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Not later than 180 days after the effective date of this order, the Security Policy Board shall develop a common set of investigative standards for background investigations for access to classified information. These standards may vary for the various levels of access.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Nothing in this order shall prohibit an agency from utilizing any lawful investigative procedure in addition to the investigative requirements set forth in this order and its implementing regulations to resolve issues that may arise during the course of a background investigation or reinvestigation.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3.3. <em>Special Circumstances</em>. (a) In exceptional circumstances where official functions must be performed prior to the completion of the investigative and adjudication process, temporary eligibility for access to classified information may be granted to an employee while the initial investigation is underway. When such eligibility is granted, the initial investigation shall be expedited.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Temporary eligibility for access under this section shall include a justification, and the employee must be notified in writing that further access is expressly conditioned on the favorable completion of the investigation and issuance of an access eligibility approval. Access will be immediately terminated, along with any assignment requiring an access eligibility approval, if such approval is not granted.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Temporary eligibility for access may be granted only by security personnel authorized by the agency head to make access eligibility determinations and shall be based on minimum investigative standards developed by the Security Policy Board not later than 180 days after the effective date of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Temporary eligibility for access may be granted only to particular, identified categories of classified information necessary to perform the lawful and authorized functions that are the basis for the granting of temporary access.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Nothing in subsection (a) shall be construed as altering the authority of an agency head to waive requirements for granting access to classified information pursuant to statutory authority.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Where access has been terminated under section 2.1(b)(4) of this order and a new need for access arises, access eligibility up to the same level shall be reapproved without further investigation as to employees who were determined to be eligible based on a favorable adjudication of an investigation completed within the prior 5 years, provided they have remained employed by the same employer during the period in question, the employee certifies in writing that there has been no change in the relevant information provided by the employee for the last background investigation, and there <!-- PDFPage:209 -->is no information that would tend to indicate the employee may no longer satisfy the standards established by this order for access to classified information.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Access eligibility shall be reapproved for individuals who were determined to be eligible based on a favorable adjudication of an investigation completed within the prior 5 years and who have been retired or otherwise separated from United States Government employment for not more than 2 years; provided there is no indication the individual may no longer satisfy the standards of this order, the individual certifies in writing that there has been no change in the relevant information provided by the individual for the last background investigation, and an appropriate record check reveals no unfavorable information.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3.4. <em>Reinvestigation Requirements</em>. (a) Because circumstances and characteristics may change dramatically over time and thereby alter the eligibility of employees for continued access to classified information, reinvestigations shall be conducted with the same priority and care as initial investigations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Employees who are eligible for access to classified information shall be the subject of periodic reinvestigations and may also be reinvestigated if, at any time, there is reason to believe that they may no longer meet the standards for access established in this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Not later than 180 days after the effective date of this order, the Security Policy Board shall develop a common set of reinvestigative standards, including the frequency of reinvestigations.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 4&mdash;INVESTIGATIONS FOR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Authority</em>. Agencies that conduct background investigations, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of State, are authorized to conduct personnel security investigations in the United States when requested by a foreign government as part of its own personnel security program and with the consent of the individual.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 5&mdash;REVIEW OF ACCESS DETERMINATIONS</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5.1. <em>Determinations of Need for Access</em>. A determination under section 2.1(b)(4) of this order that an employee does not have, or no longer has, a need for access is a discretionary determination and shall be conclusive.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5.2. <em>Review Proceedings for Denials or Revocations of Eligibility for Access</em>. (a) Applicants and employees who are determined to not meet the standards for access to classified information established in section 3.1 of this order shall be:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) provided as comprehensive and detailed a written explanation of the basis for that conclusion as the national security interests of the United States and other applicable law permit;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) provided within 30 days, upon request and to the extent the documents would be provided if requested under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or the Privacy Act (3 U.S.C. 552a), as applicable, any documents, records, and reports upon which a denial or revocation is based;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) informed of their right to be represented by counsel or other representative at their own expense; to request any documents, records, and reports as described in section 5.2(a)(2) upon which a denial or revocation is based; and to request the entire investigative file, as permitted by the national security and other applicable law, which, if requested, shall be promptly provided prior to the time set for a written reply;</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) provided a reasonable opportunity to reply in writing to, and to request a review of, the determination;</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) provided written notice of and reasons for the results of the review, the identity of the deciding authority, and written notice of the right to appeal;</p>
<p class="note-body">(6) provided an opportunity to appeal in writing to a high level panel, appointed by the agency head, which shall be comprised of at least three members, two of whom shall be selected from outside the security field. Decisions of the panel shall be in writing, and final except as provided in subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(7) provided an opportunity to appear personally and to present relevant documents, materials, and information at some point in the process before an adjudicative or other authority, other than the investigating entity, as determined by the agency head. A written summary or recording of such appearance shall be made part of the applicant's or employee's security record, unless such appearance occurs in the presence of the appeals panel described in subsection (a)(6) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Nothing in this section shall prohibit an agency head from personally exercising the appeal authority in subsection (a)(6) of this section based upon recommendations from an appeals panel. In such case, the decision of the agency head shall be final.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Agency heads shall promulgate regulations to implement this section and, at their sole discretion and as resources and national security considerations permit, may provide additional review proceedings beyond those required by subsection (a) of this section. This section does not require additional proceedings, however, and creates no procedural or substantive rights.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) When the head of an agency or principal deputy personally certifies that a procedure set forth in this section cannot be made available in a particular case without damaging the national security interests of the United States by revealing classified information, the particular procedure shall not be made available. This certification shall be conclusive.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) This section shall not be deemed to limit or affect the responsibility and power of an agency head pursuant to any law or other Executive order to deny or terminate access to classified information in the interests of national security. The power and responsibility to deny or terminate access to classified information pursuant to any law or other Executive order may be exercised only where the agency head determines that the procedures prescribed in subsection (a) of this section cannot be invoked in a manner that is consistent with national security. This determination shall be conclusive.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f)(1) This section shall not be deemed to limit or affect the responsibility and power of an agency head to make determinations of suitability for employment.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Nothing in this section shall require that an agency provide the procedures prescribed in subsection (a) of this section to an applicant where a conditional offer of employment is withdrawn for reasons of suitability or any other reason other than denial of eligibility for access to classified information.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) A suitability determination shall not be used for the purpose of denying an applicant or employee the review proceedings of this section where there has been a denial or revocation of eligibility for access to classified information.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 6&mdash;IMPLEMENTATION</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6.1. <em>Agency Implementing Responsibilities</em>.
