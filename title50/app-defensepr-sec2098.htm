The project may include only&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the facility, including the equipment, plant, machinery, supplies, and other materials associated with the facility, which converts the domestic resource to synthetic fuel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the land and mineral rights required directly for use in connection with the facilities for the production of synthetic fuels;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) any facility or equipment to be used in the extraction of a mineral for use directly and exclusively in such conversion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(aa) is co-located with the conversion facility or is located in the immediate vicinity of the conversion facility; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(bb) if not co-located or located in the immediate vicinity, is incidental to the project (except in the event of a coal mine where no other reasonable source of coal is available to the project); and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Such term may also include a project which will result in the replacement of a significant amount of oil and is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) used solely for the production of a mixture of coal and combustible liquids, including petroleum, for direct use as a fuel, but shall not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(aa) any mineral right; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(bb) any facility or equipment for extraction of any mineral;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) used solely for the commercial production of hydrogen from water through electrolysis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) a magnetohydrodynamic topping cycle used solely for the commercial production of electricity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Such a synthetic fuel project using magnetohydrodynamic technology shall only be eligible for guarantees under section 305 [section 2095 of this Appendix] or section 306 [section 2096 of this Appendix].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
