The Secretary shall give notice to the military and naval authorities of the provisions of this article [said sections], and shall include in such notice an explanation of such provisions for the information of those desiring to make application for the benefits thereof. The original of such application shall be sent by the insured to the insurer, and a copy thereof to the Secretary. The total amount of insurance on the life of one insured under poli<!-- PDFPage:110 -->cies protected by the provisions of this article [said sections] shall not exceed $10,000. If an insured makes application for protection of policies on his life totaling insurance in excess of $10,000, the Secretary is authorized to have the amount of insurance divided into two or more policies so that the protection of this article [said sections] may be extended to include policies for a total amount of insurance not to exceed $10,000, and a policy which affords the best security to the Government shall be given preference.</p>
