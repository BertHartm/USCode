In carrying out such program, the President is authorized, through the dissemination of information, educational and other campaigns, the furnishing of assistance, and such other voluntary and cooperative measures as he deems necessary or appropriate, to encourage and promote the efficient utilization, care, and preservation of food and feed, the elimination of practices which waste food and feed, the control and eradication of insects and rodents, the consumption of less of these foods and feeds which are in short supply and more of those foods and feeds which are in abundant supply, and other conservation practices. The authority herein conferred may be exercised by the President through such departments, agencies, independent establishments, and officials of the Federal Government and such State, local, and private agencies as he may determine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) There is hereby authorized to be appropriated to the President such sums as may be necessary to carry out this section. To enable the President to carry out this section for the remainder of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1948, there is made available not to exceed $1,000,000 from any funds made available by the Congress for carrying out Public Law 84, Eightieth Congress, or from any funds made available by the Congress for interim foreign aid.
