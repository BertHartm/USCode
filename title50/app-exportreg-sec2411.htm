No officer or employee of the Government Accountability Office shall disclose, except to the Congress in accordance with this paragraph, any such information which is submitted on a confidential basis and from which any individual can be identified.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reporting requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the administration of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix], reporting requirements shall be so designed as to reduce the cost of reporting, recordkeeping, and export documentation required under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] to the extent feasible consistent with effective enforcement and compilation of useful trade statistics. Reporting, recordkeeping, and export documentation requirements shall be periodically reviewed and revised in the light of developments in the field of information technology.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Simplification of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, in consultation with appropriate United States Government departments and agencies and with appropriate technical advisory committees established under section 5(h) [section 2404(h) of this Appendix], shall review the regulations issued under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] and the commodity control list in order to determine how compliance with the provisions of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] can be facilitated by simplifying such regulations, by simplifying or clarifying such list, or by any other means.</p>
