<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an application in accordance with section 1842 of this title is made to such judge as soon as practicable, but not more than 48 hours, after the Attorney General authorizes the installation and use of the pen register or trap and trace device, as the case may be, under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of emergency and factual basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A determination under this subsection is a reasonable determination by the Attorney General that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the factual basis for issuance of an order under such section 1842 of this title to approve the installation and use of the pen register or <!-- PDFPage:286 -->trap and trace device, as the case may be, exists.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Effect of absence of order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the absence of an order applied for under subsection (a)(2) of this section approving the installation and use of a pen register or trap and trace device authorized under this section, the installation and use of the pen register or trap and trace device, as the case may be, shall terminate at the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) when the information sought is obtained;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) when the application for the order is denied under section 1842 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) 48 hours after the time of the authorization by the Attorney General.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the event that an application for an order applied for under subsection (a)(2) of this section is denied, or in any other case where the installation and use of a pen register or trap and trace device under this section is terminated and no order under section 1842 of this title is issued approving the installation and use of the pen register or trap and trace device, as the case may be, no information obtained or evidence derived from the use of the pen register or trap and trace device, as the case may be, shall be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, office, agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other authority of the United States, a State, or political subdivision thereof, and no information concerning any United States person acquired from the use of the pen register or trap and trace device, as the case may be, shall subsequently be used or disclosed in any other manner by Federal officers or employees without the consent of such person, except with the approval of the Attorney General if the information indicates a threat of death or serious bodily harm to any person.</p>
