<h4 class="note-head">Creating an Official Record of the Osama Bin Laden Operation</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 112&ndash;87, title IV, &sect;414, Jan. 3, 2012, 125 Stat. 1891, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) On May 1, 2011, United States personnel killed terrorist leader Osama bin Laden during the course of a targeted strike against his secret compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Osama bin Laden was the leader of the al Qaeda terrorist organization, the most significant terrorism threat to the United States and the international community.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Osama bin Laden was the architect of terrorist attacks which killed nearly 3,000 civilians on September 11, 2001, the most deadly terrorist attack against our Nation, in which al Qaeda terrorists hijacked four airplanes and crashed them into the World Trade Center in New York City, the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and, due to heroic efforts by civilian passengers to disrupt the terrorists, near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Osama bin Laden planned or supported numerous other deadly terrorist attacks against the United States and its allies, including the 1998 bombings of United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the 2000 attack on the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen, and against innocent civilians in countries around the world, including the 2004 attack on commuter trains in Madrid, Spain and the 2005 bombings of the mass transit system in London, England.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the United States, under President George W. Bush, led an international coalition into Afghanistan to dismantle al Qaeda, deny them a safe haven in Afghanistan and ungoverned areas along the Pakistani border, and bring Osama bin Laden to justice.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) President Barack Obama in 2009 committed additional forces and resources to efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan as &lsquo;the central front in our enduring struggle against terrorism and extremism&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The valiant members of the United States Armed Forces have courageously and vigorously pursued al Qaeda and its affiliates in Afghanistan and around the world.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The anonymous, unsung heroes of the intelligence community have pursued al Qaeda and affiliates in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and around the world with tremendous dedication, sacrifice, and professionalism.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The close collaboration between the Armed Forces and the intelligence community prompted the Director of National Intelligence, General James Clapper, to state, &lsquo;Never have I seen a more remarkable example of focused integration, seamless collaboration, and sheer professional magnificence as was demonstrated by the Intelligence Community in the ultimate demise of Osama bin Laden.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) While the death of Osama bin Laden represents a significant blow to the al Qaeda organization and its affiliates and to terrorist organizations around the world, terrorism remains a critical threat to United States national security.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) President Obama said, &lsquo;For over two decades, bin Laden has been al Qaeda's leader and symbol, and has continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends and allies. The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our Nation's effort to defeat al Qaeda.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Sense of Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the raid that killed Osama bin Laden demonstrated the best of the intelligence community's capabilities and teamwork;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) for years to come, Americans will look back at this event as a defining point in the history of the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) it is vitally important that the United States memorialize all the events that led to the raid so that future generations will have an official record of the events that transpired before, during, and as a result of the operation; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) preserving this history now will allow the United States to have an accurate account of the events while those that participated in the events are still serving in the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Report on the Operation That Killed Osama Bin Laden</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 90 days after the completion of the report being prepared by the Center for the Study of Intelligence that documents the history of and lessons learned from the raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency shall submit such report to the congressional intelligence committees.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Preservation of Records</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency shall preserve any records, including intelligence information and assessments, used to generate the report described in subsection (c).&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">[For definitions of &ldquo;intelligence community&rdquo; and &ldquo;congressional intelligence committees&rdquo; as used in section 414 of Pub. L. 112&ndash;87, set out above, see section 2 of Pub. L. 112&ndash;87, set out as a note under section 401a of this title.]</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Disciplinary Actions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The regulations shall specify appropriate disciplinary actions (including loss of retirement benefits) to be taken against any employee determined by the Director of Central Intelligence to have violated the agreement of the employee under this section.&rdquo;</p>
