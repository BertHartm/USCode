<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3507. Public information collection activities&mdash;submission to Director; approval and delegation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) An agency shall not conduct or sponsor the collection of information unless, in advance of the adoption or revision of the request for collection of such information&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the agency has taken actions, including consultation with the Director, to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) eliminate, through the use of the Federal Information Locator System and other means, information collections which seek to obtain information available from another source within the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reduce to the extent practicable and appropriate the burden on persons who will provide information to the agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) formulate plans for tabulating the information in a manner which will enhance its usefulness to other agencies and to the public;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the agency (A) has submitted to the Director the proposed information collection request, copies of pertinent regulations and <!-- PDFPage:110 -->other related materials as the Director may specify, and an explanation of actions taken to carry out paragraph (1) of this subsection, and (B) has prepared a notice to be published in the Federal Register stating that the agency has made such submission and setting forth a title for the information collection request, a brief description of the need for the information and its proposed use, a description of the likely respondents and proposed frequency of response to the information collection request, and an estimate of the burden that will result from the information collection request; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Director has approved the proposed information collection request, or the period for review of information collection requests by the Director provided under subsection (b) has elapsed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Director shall, within sixty days of receipt of a proposed information collection request, notify the agency involved of the decision to approve or disapprove the request and shall make such decisions, including an explanation thereof, publicly available. If the Director determines that a request submitted for review cannot be reviewed within sixty days, the Director may, after notice to the agency involved, extend the review period for an additional thirty days. If the Director does not notify the agency of an extension, denial, or approval within sixty days (or, if the Director has extended the review period for an additional thirty days and does not notify the agency of a denial or approval within the time of the extension), a control number shall be assigned without further delay, the approval may be inferred, and the agency may collect the information for not more than one year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Any disapproval by the Director, in whole or in part, of a proposed information collection request of an independent regulatory agency, or an exercise of authority under section 3504(h) or 3509 concerning such an agency, may be voided, if the agency by a majority vote of its members overrides the Director's disapproval or exercise of authority. The agency shall certify each override to the Director, shall explain the reasons for exercising the override authority. Where the override concerns an information collection request, the Director shall without further delay assign a control number to such request, and such override shall be valid for a period of three years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Director may not approve an information collection request for a period in excess of three years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If the Director finds that a senior official of an agency designated pursuant to section 3506(b) is sufficiently independent of program responsibility to evaluate fairly whether proposed information collection requests should be approved and has sufficient resources to carry out this responsibility effectively, the Director may, by rule in accordance with the notice and comment provisions of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, delegate to such official the authority to approve proposed requests in specific program areas, for specific purposes, or for all agency purposes. A delegation by the Director under this section shall not preclude the Director from reviewing individual information collection requests if the Director determines that circumstances warrant such a review. The Director shall retain authority to revoke such delegations, both in general and with regard to any specific matter. In acting for the Director, any official to whom approval authority has been delegated under this section shall comply fully with the rules and regulations promulgated by the Director.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) An agency shall not engage in a collection of information without obtaining from the Director a control number to be displayed upon the information collection request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) If an agency head determines a collection of information (1) is needed prior to the expiration of the sixty-day period for the review of information collection requests established pursuant to subsection (b), (2) is essential to the mission of the agency, and (3) the agency cannot reasonably comply with the provisions of this chapter within such sixty-day period because (A) public harm will result if normal clearance procedures are followed, or (B) an unanticipated event has occurred and the use of normal clearance procedures will prevent or disrupt the collection of information related to the event or will cause a statutory deadline to be missed, the agency head may request the Director to authorize such collection of information prior to expiration of such sixty-day period. The Director shall approve or disapprove any such authorization request within the time requested by the agency head and, if approved, shall assign the information collection request a control number. Any collection of information conducted pursuant to this subsection may be conducted without compliance with the provisions of this chapter for a maximum of ninety days after the date on which the Director received the request to authorize such collection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Any written communication to the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs or to any employee thereof from any person not employed by the Federal Government or from an agency concerning a proposed information collection request, and any written communication from the Administrator or employee of the Office to such person or agency concerning such proposal, shall be made available to the public. This subsection shall not require the disclosure of any information which is protected at all times by procedures established for information which has been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.</p>
