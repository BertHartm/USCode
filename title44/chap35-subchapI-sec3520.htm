<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) subject to the minimum requirements under paragraph (2), the number of representatives to be designated under each subparagraph of that paragraph; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The task force shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) identify ways to integrate the collection of information across Federal agencies and programs and examine the feasibility and desirability of requiring each agency to consolidate requirements regarding collections of information with respect to small business concerns within and across agencies, without negatively impacting the effectiveness of underlying laws and regulations regarding such collections of information, in order that each small business concern may submit all information required by the agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to 1 point of contact in the agency;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) are within the range of acceptable options for each data field;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) make recommendations to improve the electronic dissemination of information collected under Federal requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) recommend a plan for the development of an interactive Governmentwide system, available through the Internet, to allow each small business to&mdash;</p>
