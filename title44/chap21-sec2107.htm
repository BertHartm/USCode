<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) all Government records concerning the assassination of President John F.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) legislation is necessary to create an enforceable, independent, and accountable process for the public disclosure of such records;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) legislation is necessary because congressional records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy would not otherwise be subject to public disclosure until at least the year 2029;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) legislation is necessary because the Freedom of Information Act [5 U.S.C. 552], as implemented by the executive branch, has prevented the timely public disclosure of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) legislation is necessary because Executive Order No. 12356 [50 U.S.C. 435 note], entitled &lsquo;National Security Information&rsquo; has eliminated the declassification and downgrading schedules relating to classified information across government and has prevented the timely public disclosure of records relating to the assassination of President John F.
