<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The use of computers and the Internet is rapidly transforming societal interactions and the relationships among citizens, private businesses, and the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Federal Government has had uneven success in applying advances in information technology to enhance governmental functions and services, achieve more efficient performance, increase access to Government information, and increase citizen participation in Government.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Most Internet-based services of the Federal Government are developed and presented separately, according to the jurisdictional boundaries of an individual department or agency, rather than being integrated cooperatively according to function or topic.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Internet-based Government services involving interagency cooperation are especially difficult to develop and promote, in part because of a lack of sufficient funding mechanisms to support such interagency cooperation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Electronic Government has its impact through improved Government performance and outcomes within and across agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Electronic Government is a critical element in the management of Government, to be implemented as part of a management framework that also addresses finance, procurement, human capital, and other challenges to improve the performance of Government.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) To take full advantage of the improved Government performance that can be achieved through the <!-- PDFPage:150 -->use of Internet-based technology requires strong leadership, better organization, improved interagency collaboration, and more focused oversight of agency compliance with statutes related to information resource management.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this Act [see Tables for classification] are the following:</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) To promote use of the Internet and other information technologies to provide increased opportunities for citizen participation in Government.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) To promote interagency collaboration in providing electronic Government services, where this collaboration would improve the service to citizens by integrating related functions, and in the use of internal electronic Government processes, where this collaboration would improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the processes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) To improve the ability of the Government to achieve agency missions and program performance goals.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) To promote the use of the Internet and emerging technologies within and across Government agencies to provide citizen-centric Government information and services.</p>
