<h4 class="note-head">Vegetable Ink Printing</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 103&ndash;348, Oct. 6, 1994, 108 Stat. 3133, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Vegetable Ink Printing Act of 1994&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) More than 95 percent of Federal printing involving documents or publications is performed using lithographic inks.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Various types of oil, including petroleum and vegetable oil, are used in lithographic ink.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Increasing the amount of vegetable oil used in a lithographic ink would&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) help reduce the Nation's use of nonrenewable energy resources;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) result in the use of products that are less damaging to the environment;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) result in a reduction of volatile organic compound emissions; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) increase the use of renewable agricultural products.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The technology exists to use vegetable oil in lithographic ink and, in some applications, to use lithographic ink that uses no petroleum distillates in the liquid portion of the ink.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Some lithographic inks have contained vegetable oils for many years; other lithographic inks have more recently begun to use vegetable oil.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) According to the Government Printing Office, using vegetable oil-based ink appears to add little if any additional cost to Government printing.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Use of vegetable oil-based ink in Federal Government printing should further develop&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the commercial viability of vegetable oil-based ink, which could result in demand, for domestic use alone, for 2,500,000,000 pounds of vegetable crops or 500,000,000 pounds of vegetable oil; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) a product that could help the United States retain or enlarge its share of the world market for vegetable oil-ink.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of this Act is to require that all lithographic printing using ink containing oil that is performed or procured by a Federal agency shall use ink containing the maximum amounts of vegetable oil and materials derived from other renewable resources that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) are technologically feasible, and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) result in printing costs that are competitive with printing using petroleum-based inks.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. FEDERAL PRINTING REQUIREMENTS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>General Rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other law, and except as provided in subsection (b), a Federal agency may not perform or procure lithographic printing that uses ink containing oil if the ink contains less than the following percentage of vegetable oil:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) In the case of news ink, 40 percent.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In the case of sheet-fed ink, 20 percent.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In the case of forms ink, 20 percent.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) In the case of heat-set ink, 10 percent.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Exceptions.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Exceptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subsection (a) shall not apply to lithographic printing performed or procured by a Federal agency, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the head of the agency determines, after consultation with the Public Printer and within the 3-year period ending on the date of the commencement of the printing or the date of that procurement, respectively, that vegetable oil-based ink is not suitable to meet specific, identified requirements of the agency related to the printing; or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) the Public Printer determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(i) within the 3-month period ending on the date of the commencement of the printing, in the case of printing of materials that are printed at intervals of less than 6 months, or</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(ii) before the date of the commencement of the printing, in the case of printing of materials that are printed at intervals of 6 months or more;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">&nbsp;&nbsp;that the cost of performing the printing using vegetable oil-based ink is significantly greater than the cost of performing the printing using other available ink.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Notice to congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 30 days after making a determination under paragraph (1)(A), the head of a Federal agency shall report the determination to the Committee on Government Operations [now Committee on Government Reform] and the Committee on House Administration of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Rules of the Senate.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Federal Agency Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this Act, the term &lsquo;Federal agency&rsquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) an executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government-controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) an establishment or component of the legislative or judicial branch of the Government.&rdquo;</p>
