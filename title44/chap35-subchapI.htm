<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The quality of Federal statistics depends on the willingness of businesses to respond to statistical surveys. Reducing reporting burdens will increase response rates, and therefore lead to more accurate characterizations of the economy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Enhanced sharing of business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics for exclusively statistical purposes will improve their ability to track more accurately the large and rapidly changing nature of United States business. In particular, the statistical agencies will be able to better ensure that businesses are consistently classified in appropriate industries, resolve data anomalies, produce statistical samples that are consistently adjusted for the entry and exit of new businesses in a timely manner, and correct faulty reporting errors quickly and efficiently.</p>

The Act not only expanded detailed industry coverage from 135 industries to over 800 industries with no increase in the data collected from respondents but also demonstrated how data sharing can result in the creation of valuable data products.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) To improve the comparability and accuracy of Federal economic statistics by allowing the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to update sample frames, develop consistent classifications of establishments and companies into industries, improve coverage, and reconcile significant differences in data produced by the three agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) To increase understanding of the United States economy, especially for key industry and regional statistics, to develop more accurate measures of the impact of technology on productivity growth, and to enhance the reliability of the Nation's most important economic indicators, such as the National Income and Product Accounts.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13556, Nov. 4, 2010, 75 F.R. 68675, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Purpose</em>. This order establishes an open and uniform program for managing information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to and consistent with law, regulations, and Government-wide policies, excluding information that is classified under Executive Order 13526 of December 29, 2009, or the Atomic Energy Act, as amended.</p>
<p class="note-body">At present, executive departments and agencies (agencies) employ ad hoc, agency-specific policies, procedures, and markings to safeguard and control this information, such as information that involves privacy, security, proprietary business interests, and law enforcement investigations. This inefficient, confusing patchwork has resulted in inconsistent marking and safeguarding of documents, led to unclear or unnecessarily restrictive dissemination policies, and created impediments to authorized information sharing. The fact that these agency-specific policies are often hidden from public view has only aggravated these issues.</p>
<p class="note-body">To address these problems, this order establishes a program for managing this information, hereinafter described as Controlled Unclassified Information, that emphasizes the openness and uniformity of Government-wide practice.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The CUI categories and subcategories shall serve as exclusive designations for identifying unclassified information throughout the executive branch that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls, pursuant to and consistent with applicable law, regulations, and Government-wide policies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The mere fact that information is designated as CUI shall not have a bearing on determinations pursuant to any law requiring the disclosure of information <!-- PDFPage:121 -->or permitting disclosure as a matter of discretion, including disclosures to the legislative or judicial branches.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The National Archives and Records Administration shall serve as the Executive Agent to implement this order and oversee agency actions to ensure compliance with this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Review of Current Designations.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Each agency head shall, within 180 days of the date of this order:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) review all categories, subcategories, and markings used by the agency to designate unclassified information for safeguarding or dissemination controls; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) submit to the Executive Agent a catalogue of proposed categories and subcategories of CUI, and proposed associated markings for information designated as CUI under section 2(a) of this order. This submission shall provide definitions for each proposed category and subcategory and identify the basis in law, regulation, or Government-wide policy for safeguarding or dissemination controls.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) If there is significant doubt about whether information should be designated as CUI, it shall not be so designated.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Development of CUI Categories and Policies.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) On the basis of the submissions under section 3 of this order or future proposals, and in consultation with affected agencies, the Executive Agent shall, in a timely manner, approve categories and subcategories of CUI and associated markings to be applied uniformly throughout the executive branch and to become effective upon publication in the registry established under subsection (d) of this section. No unclassified information meeting the requirements of section 2(a) of this order shall be disapproved for inclusion as CUI, but the Executive Agent may resolve conflicts among categories and subcategories of CUI to achieve uniformity and may determine the markings to be used.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Executive Agent, in consultation with affected agencies, shall develop and issue such directives as are necessary to implement this order. Such directives shall be made available to the public and shall provide policies and procedures concerning marking, safeguarding, dissemination, and decontrol of CUI that, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, regulation, and Government-wide policies, shall remain consistent across categories and subcategories of CUI and throughout the executive branch. In developing such directives, appropriate consideration should be given to the report of the interagency Task Force on Controlled Unclassified Information published in August 2009. The Executive Agent shall issue initial directives for the implementation of this order within 180 days of the date of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Executive Agent shall convene and chair interagency meetings to discuss matters pertaining to the program established by this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Within 1 year of the date of this order, the Executive Agent shall establish and maintain a public CUI registry reflecting authorized CUI categories and subcategories, associated markings, and applicable safeguarding, dissemination, and decontrol procedures.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) If the Executive Agent and an agency cannot reach agreement on an issue related to the implementation of this order, that issue may be appealed to the President through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) In performing its functions under this order, the Executive Agent, in accordance with applicable law, shall consult with representatives of the public and State, local, tribal, and private sector partners on matters related to approving categories and subcategories of CUI and developing implementing directives issued by the Executive Agent pursuant to this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Implementation.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Within 180 days of the issuance of initial policies and procedures by the Executive Agent in accordance with section 4(b) of this order, each agency that originates or handles CUI shall provide the Executive Agent with a proposed plan for compliance with the requirements of this order, including the establishment of interim target dates.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) After a review of agency plans, and in consultation with affected agencies and the Office of Management and Budget, the Executive Agent shall establish deadlines for phased implementation by agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) In each of the first 5 years following the date of this order and biennially thereafter, the Executive Agent shall publish a report on the status of agency implementation of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>General Provisions.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) applicable law, including protections of confidentiality and privacy rights;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) the statutory authority of the heads of agencies, including authorities related to the protection of information provided by the private sector to the Federal Government; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) applicable Government-wide standards and guidelines issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and applicable policies established by the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Director of National Intelligence (Director), with respect to the Intelligence Community and after consultation with the heads of affected agencies, may issue such policy directives and guidelines as the Director deems necessary to implement this order with respect to intelligence and intelligence-related information. Procedures or other guidance issued by Intelligence Community element heads shall be in accordance with such policy directives or guidelines issued by the Director. Any such policy directives or guidelines issued by the Director shall be in accordance with this order and directives issued by the Executive Agent.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This order shall not be construed to impair or otherwise affect the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, and legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) This order shall be implemented subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) The Attorney General, upon request by the head of an agency or the Executive Agent, shall render an interpretation of this order with respect to any question arising in the course of its administration.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Making It Easier for America's Small Businesses and America's Exporters to Access Government Services to Help Them Grow and Hire</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Oct. 28, 2011, 76 F.R. 68049, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">As I outlined in my State of the Union address to the Congress on January 25, 2011, winning the future in the global economy will require a Government that wisely allocates its scarce resources to maximize efficiency and effectiveness so that it can best support American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth. If we are to thrive in the global economy, and make America the best place on Earth to do business, we need to equip our Government with the tools necessary to support innovation and job growth in the 21st century.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, we must make it easier for businesses to access the full range of Government programs and services without having to waste effort navigating their way through the Federal bureaucracy. At the same time, we must further streamline and coordinate Federal programs to reduce costs and provide customer-oriented service.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:122 --><p class="note-body">Businesses looking for assistance from the Federal Government should feel like they are interacting with one entity, rather than a number of separate, albeit linked, components. This means adopting a &ldquo;No Wrong Door&rdquo; policy that uses technology to quickly connect businesses to the services and information relevant to them, regardless of which agency's website, call center, or office they go to for help.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition, a business's interactions with the Federal Government should be individualized and efficient. If the private sector can allow consumers to customize interactions so that they receive only the information they want, in the form they want it, so can the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Today, I am directing a first wave of changes focused on both small businesses and businesses of all sizes that want to begin or increase exporting (exporters), because those businesses help drive economic growth and have the most to gain from Federal assistance. We plan to use the resulting improvements as a model for future reforms so that, in time, all businesses and all citizens receive the highest level of customer service when they interact with the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, I direct the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) All executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall work with a Steering Committee co-chaired by the Federal Chief Information Officer, Assistant to the President and Chief Technology Officer, and Chief Performance Officer (the Co-Chairs) to carry out the directives in this memorandum within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, unless a provision of this memorandum expressly states otherwise. The Steering Committee shall include senior policy and technical representatives, appointed by the heads of their respective agencies, from the Departments of State, Defense, Agriculture, Commerce, and Veterans Affairs, the Small Business Administration (SBA), the General Services Administration (GSA), the Export-Import Bank, and other agencies designated by the Co-Chairs. The Co-Chairs and representatives from the Department of Commerce and SBA shall serve as the Executive Committee of the Steering Committee, which shall coordinate the strategy, design, development, launch, and operation of BusinessUSA, a common, open, online platform and web service with dedicated resources that will, as a first step, disseminate core information regarding the Federal Government's programs and services relevant to small businesses and exporters.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Agencies shall work with the Steering Committee to develop and launch an introductory version of BusinessUSA. BusinessUSA shall be designed, tested, and built with the active feedback of U.S. businesses and relevant online communities. To the extent appropriate, practicable, and permitted by law, the BusinessUSA platform shall integrate related State and local government services as well as those of private sector partners.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Agencies shall make information regarding their small business and export programs and services accessible through BusinessUSA. To accomplish this in a uniform fashion, the Steering Committee shall develop a common set of standards for content available through BusinessUSA, which shall identify the types of programs and services to be included initially on BusinessUSA and a structure for organizing and presenting such information. These standards shall be used by all agencies in the creation, presentation, and delivery of information regarding their programs and services, to the extent practicable and permitted by law.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) Agencies shall also work with the Steering Committee to develop new content for BusinessUSA that synthesizes information available across agencies to better serve small businesses and exporters. Among other things, agencies shall work together to aggregate on the BusinessUSA platform statistical, demographic, and other raw Government datasets of particular interest to small businesses and exporters, making Government data more easily accessible and spurring innovative uses of the data through business-oriented web or mobile applications.</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) Agencies shall integrate BusinessUSA, including ready access to the BusinessUSA website, into their current websites, call centers, and field offices to ensure that small businesses and exporters have access to the wide range of Government programs and services at each entry point into the Federal Government. During the year following the date of this memorandum, agencies shall work with GSA and the Office of Management and Budget to enhance the centralized call center for responding to public questions about Federal programs and services (1&ndash;800&ndash;FED&ndash;INFO) to add expertise with Government programs and services for small businesses and exporters.</p>
<p class="note-body">(6) (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) authority granted by law or Executive Order to an agency, or the head thereof; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) BusinessUSA shall be operated by a single hosting agency under the Executive Committee's coordination. To the extent permitted by law, agencies shall reimburse the hosting agency for the cost of establishing, maintaining, and operating BusinessUSA.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">(7) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13073, Feb. 4, 1998, 63 F.R. 6467, as amended by Ex. Ord. No. 13127, June 14, 1999, 64 F.R. 32793, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">The American people expect reliable service from their Government and deserve the confidence that critical government functions dependent on electronic systems will be performed accurately and in a timely manner. Because of a design feature in many electronic systems, a large number of activities in the public and private sectors could be at risk beginning in the year 2000. Some computer systems and other electronic devices will misinterpret the year &ldquo;00&rdquo; as 1900, rather than 2000. Unless appropriate action is taken, this flaw, known as the &ldquo;Y2K problem,&rdquo; can cause systems that support those functions to compute erroneously or simply not run. Minimizing the Y2K problem will require a major technological and managerial effort, and it is critical that the United States Government do its part in addressing this challenge.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. (a) It shall be the policy of the executive branch that agencies shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) assure that no critical Federal program experiences disruption because of the Y2K problem;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) assist and cooperate with State, local, and tribal governments to address the Y2K problem where those governments depend on Federal information or information technology or the Federal Government is dependent on those governments to perform critical missions;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) cooperate with the private sector operators of critical national and local systems, including the banking and financial system, the telecommunications system, the public health system, the transportation system, and the electric power generation system, in addressing the Y2K problem; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) communicate with their foreign counterparts to raise awareness of and generate cooperative international arrangements to address the Y2K problem.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) As used in this order, &ldquo;agency&rdquo; and &ldquo;agencies&rdquo; refer to Federal agencies that are not in the judicial or legislative branches.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Year 2000 Conversion Council</em>. There is hereby established the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion (the &ldquo;Council&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The Council shall be led by a Chair who shall be an Assistant to the President, and it shall be composed of one representative from each of the executive departments and from such other Federal agencies as may be determined by the Chair of the Council (the &ldquo;Chair&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Chair shall appoint a Vice Chair and assign other responsibilities for operations of the council as he or she deems necessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Chair shall oversee the activities of agencies to assure that their systems operate smoothly through the year 2000, act as chief spokesperson on this issue for the executive branch in national and international fora, provide policy coordination of executive branch activities with State, local, and tribal governments on the Y2K problem, and promote appropriate Federal roles with respect to private sector activities in this area.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The Chair and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall report jointly at least quarterly to me on the progress of agencies in addressing the Y2K problem.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The Chair shall identify such resources from agencies as the Chair deems necessary for the implementation of the policies set out in this order, consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Responsibilities of Agency Heads</em>. (a) The head of each agency shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) assure that efforts to address the Y2K problem receive the highest priority attention in the agency and that the policies established in this order are carried out; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) cooperate to the fullest extent with the Chair by making available such information, support, and assistance, including personnel, as the Chair may request to support the accomplishment of the tasks assigned herein, consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The heads of executive departments and the agencies designated by the Chair under section 2(a) of this order shall identify a responsible official to represent the head of the executive department or agency on the Council with sufficient authority and experience to commit agency resources to address the Y2K problem.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Responsibilities of Interagency and Executive Office Councils</em>. Interagency councils and councils within the Executive Office of the President, including the President's Management Council, the Chief Information Officers Council, the Chief Financial Officers Council, the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency, the Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency, the National Science and Technology Council, the National Performance Review, the National Economic Council, the Domestic Policy Council, and the National Security Council shall provide assistance and support to the Chair upon the Chair's request.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Information Coordination Center</em>. (a) To assist the Chair in the Y2K response duties included under section 2(c) of this order, there shall be established the Information Coordination Center (ICC) in the General Services Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) At the direction of the Chair, the ICC will assist in making preparations for information sharing and coordination within the Federal Government and key components of the public and private sectors, coordinating agency assessments of Y2K emergencies that could have an adverse affect on U.S. interests at home and abroad, and, if necessary, assisting Federal agencies and the Chair in reconstitution processes where appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The ICC will:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) consist of officials from executive agencies, designated by agency heads under subsection 3(a)(2) of this order, who have expertise in important management and technical areas, computer hardware, software or security systems, reconstitution and recovery, and of additional personnel hired directly or by contract, as required, to carry out the duties described under section 5 of this order;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) work with the Council and the Office of Management and Budget to assure that Federal efforts to restore critical systems are coordinated with efforts managed by Federal agencies acting under existing emergency response authorities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The Chair of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion shall designate a Director of the ICC.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This Executive order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) conduct the review established under section 3506(c), including the seeking of comment from the public on the continued need for, and burden imposed by the collection of information; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) after having made a reasonable effort to seek public comment, but no later than 60 days before the expiration date of the control number assigned by the Director for the currently approved collection of information, submit the collection of information for review and approval under this section, which shall include an explanation of how the agency has used the information that it has collected.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If under the provisions of this section, the Director disapproves a collection of information contained in an existing rule, or recommends or instructs the agency to make a substantive or material change to a collection of information contained in an existing rule, the Director shall&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An agency may not make a substantive or material modification to a collection of information after such collection has been approved by the Director, unless the modification has been submitted to the Director for review and approval under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) If the Director finds that a senior official of an agency designated under section 3506(a) is sufficiently independent of program responsibility to evaluate fairly whether proposed collections of information should be approved and has sufficient resources to carry out this responsibility effectively, the Director may, by rule in accordance with the notice and comment provisions of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, delegate to such official the authority to approve proposed collections of information in specific program areas, for specific purposes, or for all agency purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A delegation by the Director under this section shall not preclude the Director from reviewing individual collections of information if the Director determines that circumstances warrant such a review. The Director shall retain authority to revoke such delegations, both in general and with regard to any specific matter. In acting for the Director, any official to whom approval authority has been delegated under this section shall comply fully with the rules and regulations promulgated by the Director.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a collection of information&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is needed prior to the expiration of time periods established under this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) is essential to the mission of the agency; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the agency cannot reasonably comply with the provisions of this subchapter because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) public harm is reasonably likely to result if normal clearance procedures are followed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) an unanticipated event has occurred; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the use of normal clearance procedures is reasonably likely to prevent or disrupt the collection of information or is reasonably likely to cause a statutory or court ordered deadline to be missed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Director shall approve or disapprove any such authorization request within the time requested by the agency head and, if approved, shall assign the collection of information a control number. Any collection of information conducted under this subsection may be conducted without compliance with the provisions of this subchapter for a maximum of 180 days after the date on which the Director received the request to authorize such collection.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Director may designate a central collection agency to obtain information for two or more agencies if the Director determines that the needs of such agencies for information will be adequately served by a single collection agency, and such sharing of data is not inconsistent with applicable law. In such cases the Director shall prescribe (with reference to the collection of information) the duties and functions of the collection agency so designated and of the agencies for which it is to act as agent (including reimbursement for costs). While the designation is in effect, an agency covered by the designation may not obtain for itself information for the agency which is the duty of the collection agency to obtain.
