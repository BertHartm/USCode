<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13073, Feb. 4, 1998, 63 F.R. 6467, as amended by Ex. Ord. No. 13127, June 14, 1999, 64 F.R. 32793, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">The American people expect reliable service from their Government and deserve the confidence that crit<!-- PDFPage:115 -->ical government functions dependent on electronic systems will be performed accurately and in a timely manner. Because of a design feature in many electronic systems, a large number of activities in the public and private sectors could be at risk beginning in the year 2000. Some computer systems and other electronic devices will misinterpret the year &ldquo;00&rdquo; as 1900, rather than 2000. Unless appropriate action is taken, this flaw, known as the &ldquo;Y2K problem,&rdquo; can cause systems that support those functions to compute erroneously or simply not run. Minimizing the Y2K problem will require a major technological and managerial effort, and it is critical that the United States Government do its part in addressing this challenge.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. (a) It shall be the policy of the executive branch that agencies shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) assure that no critical Federal program experiences disruption because of the Y2K problem;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) assist and cooperate with State, local, and tribal governments to address the Y2K problem where those governments depend on Federal information or information technology or the Federal Government is dependent on those governments to perform critical missions;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) cooperate with the private sector operators of critical national and local systems, including the banking and financial system, the telecommunications system, the public health system, the transportation system, and the electric power generation system, in addressing the Y2K problem; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) communicate with their foreign counterparts to raise awareness of and generate cooperative international arrangements to address the Y2K problem.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) As used in this order, &ldquo;agency&rdquo; and &ldquo;agencies&rdquo; refer to Federal agencies that are not in the judicial or legislative branches.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Year 2000 Conversion Council</em>. There is hereby established the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion (the &ldquo;Council&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The Council shall be led by a Chair who shall be an Assistant to the President, and it shall be composed of one representative from each of the executive departments and from such other Federal agencies as may be determined by the Chair of the Council (the &ldquo;Chair&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Chair shall appoint a Vice Chair and assign other responsibilities for operations of the council as he or she deems necessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Chair shall oversee the activities of agencies to assure that their systems operate smoothly through the year 2000, act as chief spokesperson on this issue for the executive branch in national and international fora, provide policy coordination of executive branch activities with State, local, and tribal governments on the Y2K problem, and promote appropriate Federal roles with respect to private sector activities in this area.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The Chair and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall report jointly at least quarterly to me on the progress of agencies in addressing the Y2K problem.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The Chair shall identify such resources from agencies as the Chair deems necessary for the implementation of the policies set out in this order, consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Responsibilities of Agency Heads</em>. (a) The head of each agency shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) assure that efforts to address the Y2K problem receive the highest priority attention in the agency and that the policies established in this order are carried out; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) cooperate to the fullest extent with the Chair by making available such information, support, and assistance, including personnel, as the Chair may request to support the accomplishment of the tasks assigned herein, consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The heads of executive departments and the agencies designated by the Chair under section 2(a) of this order shall identify a responsible official to represent the head of the executive department or agency on the Council with sufficient authority and experience to commit agency resources to address the Y2K problem.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Responsibilities of Interagency and Executive Office Councils</em>. Interagency councils and councils within the Executive Office of the President, including the President's Management Council, the Chief Information Officers Council, the Chief Financial Officers Council, the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency, the Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency, the National Science and Technology Council, the National Performance Review, the National Economic Council, the Domestic Policy Council, and the National Security Council shall provide assistance and support to the Chair upon the Chair's request.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Information Coordination Center</em>. (a) To assist the Chair in the Y2K response duties included under section 2(c) of this order, there shall be established the Information Coordination Center (ICC) in the General Services Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) At the direction of the Chair, the ICC will assist in making preparations for information sharing and coordination within the Federal Government and key components of the public and private sectors, coordinating agency assessments of Y2K emergencies that could have an adverse affect on U.S. interests at home and abroad, and, if necessary, assisting Federal agencies and the Chair in reconstitution processes where appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The ICC will:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) consist of officials from executive agencies, designated by agency heads under subsection 3(a)(2) of this order, who have expertise in important management and technical areas, computer hardware, software or security systems, reconstitution and recovery, and of additional personnel hired directly or by contract, as required, to carry out the duties described under section 5 of this order;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) work with the Council and the Office of Management and Budget to assure that Federal efforts to restore critical systems are coordinated with efforts managed by Federal agencies acting under existing emergency response authorities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The Chair of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion shall designate a Director of the ICC.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This Executive order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) after having made a reasonable effort to seek public comment, but no later than 60 days before the expiration date of the control number assigned by the Director for the currently approved collection of information, submit the collection of information for review and approval under this section, which shall include an explanation of how the agency has used the information that it has collected.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If under the provisions of this section, the Director disapproves a collection of information contained in an existing rule, or recommends or instructs the agency to make a substantive or material change to a collection of information contained in an existing rule, the Director shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) If the Director finds that a senior official of an agency designated under section 3506(a) is sufficiently independent of program responsibility to evaluate fairly whether proposed collections of information should be approved and has sufficient resources to carry out this responsibility effectively, the Director may, by rule in accordance with the notice and comment provisions of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, delegate to such official the authority to approve proposed collections of information in specific program areas, for specific purposes, or for all agency purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A delegation by the Director under this section shall not preclude the Director from reviewing individual collections of information if the Director determines that circumstances warrant such a review. The Director shall retain authority to revoke such delegations, both in general and with regard to any specific matter. In acting for the Director, any official to whom approval authority has been delegated under this section shall comply fully with the rules and regulations promulgated by the Director.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j)(1) The agency head may request the Director to authorize a collection of information, if an agency head determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a collection of information&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is needed prior to the expiration of time periods established under this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) is essential to the mission of the agency; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the agency cannot reasonably comply with the provisions of this subchapter because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) public harm is reasonably likely to result if normal clearance procedures are followed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) an unanticipated event has occurred; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the use of normal clearance procedures is reasonably likely to prevent or disrupt the collection of information or is reasonably likely to cause a statutory or court ordered deadline to be missed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Director shall approve or disapprove any such authorization request within the time requested by the agency head and, if approved, shall assign the collection of information a control number. Any collection of information conducted under this subsection may be conducted without compliance with the provisions of this subchapter for a maximum of 180 days after the date on which the Director received the request to authorize such collection.</p>

In such cases the Director shall prescribe (with reference to the collection of information) the duties and functions of the collection agency so designated and of the agencies for which it is to act as agent (including reimbursement for costs). While the designation is in effect, an agency covered by the designation may not obtain for itself information for the agency which is the duty of the collection agency to obtain. The Director may modify the designation from time to time as circumstances require.
