<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Purchases may be made from appropriations under the &ldquo;Government Printing Office&rdquo; without reference to subtitle I of title 40 and title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 et seq.) concerning purchases for the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In addition to the authority to negotiate otherwise provided by law, the Public Printer may negotiate purchases and contracts for supplies or services for which the Public Printer determines that it is impracticable to secure competition by advertising. The Public Printer may not award a contract under this subsection unless he justifies the use of negotiation in writing and certifies the accuracy and completeness of the justification. The justification shall set out facts and circumstances that clearly and convincingly establish that advertising would not be practicable for such contract. Such a justification is final and a copy thereof shall be maintained in the Government Printing Office for at least 6 years after the date of the determination. The Public Printer may designate one or more employees of the Government Printing Office to carry out this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, section 3709 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5) shall apply with respect to purchases and contracts for the Government Printing Office as if the reference to &ldquo;$25,000&rdquo; in clause (1) of such section were a reference to &ldquo;$100,000&rdquo;.</p>
