<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Archivist shall provide for the establishment in such Trust Fund of separate endowments for the maintenance of the land, facility, and equipment of each Presidential archival depository, to which shall be credited any gifts or bequests received under paragraph (1) that are offered for that purpose. Income to each such endowment shall be available to cover the cost of facility operations, but shall not be available for the performance of archival functions under this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) 20 percent; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If a proposed physical or material change or addition to a Presidential archival depository would result in an increase in the costs of facility operations, the Archivist may not accept any gift under subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) for the purpose of making such a change or addition, or may not implement any provision of law requiring the making of such a change or addition, unless the Archivist determines that there is available, by gift or bequest for deposit under paragraph (2) of this subsection in an endowment with respect to such depository, an amount for the purpose of maintaining the land, facility, and equipment of such depository equal to the difference between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the amount which, pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection, would have been required to have been available for deposit in such endowment with respect to such depository if such change or addition had been included in such depository on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the date on which the Archivist took title to the land, facility, and equipment for such depository under subparagraph (A) of subsection (a)(1); or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Notwithstanding paragraphs (3) and (4) (to the extent that such paragraphs are inconsistent with this paragraph), this subsection shall be administered in accordance with this paragraph with respect to any Presidential archival depository created as a depository for the papers, documents, and other historical materials and Presidential records pertaining to any President who takes the oath of office as President for the first time on or after July 1, 2002.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraphs (A)(ii), (B)(i)(II), and (B)(ii)(II) of paragraph (3) the percentage of 60 percent shall apply instead of 20 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) In this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;base endowment amount&rdquo; means the amount of the endowment required under paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii)(I) The Archivist may give credits against the base endowment amount if the Archivist determines that the proposed Presidential archival depository will have construction features or equipment that are expected to result in quantifiable long-term savings to the Government with respect to the cost of facility operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) The features and equipment described under subclause (I) shall comply with the stand<!-- PDFPage:76 -->ards promulgated by the Archivist under subsection (a)(2).</p>
