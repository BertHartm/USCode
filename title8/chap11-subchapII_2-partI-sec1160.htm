<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Lawful residence</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall adjust the status of an alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence if the Attorney General determines that the alien meets the following requirements:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Application period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The alien must apply for such adjustment during the 18-month period beginning on the first day of the seventh month that begins after November 6, 1986.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Performance of seasonal agricultural services and residence in the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The alien must establish that he has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) resided in the United States, and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:78 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) performed seasonal agricultural services in the United States for at least 90 man-days,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">during the 12-month period ending on May 1, 1986. For purposes of the previous sentence, performance of seasonal agricultural services in the United States for more than one employer on any one day shall be counted as performance of services for only 1 man-day.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Admissible as immigrant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The alien must establish that he is admissible to the United States as an immigrant, except as otherwise provided under subsection (c)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustment to permanent residence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall adjust the status of any alien provided lawful temporary resident status under paragraph (1) to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence on the following date:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Group 1</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the numerical limitation established under subparagraph (C), in the case of an alien who has established, at the time of application for temporary residence under paragraph (1), that the alien performed seasonal agricultural services in the United States for at least 90 man-days during each of the 12-month periods ending on May 1, 1984, 1985, and 1986, the adjustment shall occur on the first day after the end of the one-year period that begins on the later of (I) the date the alien was granted such temporary resident status, or (II) the day after the last day of the application period described in paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Group 2</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of aliens to which subparagraph (A) does not apply, the adjustment shall occur on the day after the last day of the two-year period that begins on the later of (I) the date the alien was granted such temporary resident status, or (II) the day after the last day of the application period described in paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Numerical limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to more than 350,000 aliens. If more than 350,000 aliens meet the requirements of such subparagraph, such subparagraph shall apply to the 350,000 aliens whose applications for adjustment were first filed under paragraph (1) and subparagraph (B) shall apply to the remaining aliens.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Termination of temporary residence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) During the period of temporary resident status granted an alien under paragraph (1), the Attorney General may terminate such status only upon a determination under this chapter that the alien is deportable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Before any alien becomes eligible for adjustment of status under paragraph (2), the Attorney General may deny adjustment to permanent status and provide for termination of the temporary resident status granted such alien under paragraph (1) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the Attorney General finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the adjustment to temporary resident status was the result of fraud or willful misrepresentation as set out in section 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the alien commits an act that (I) makes the alien inadmissible to the United States as an immigrant, except as provided under subsection (c)(2) of this section, or (II) is convicted of a felony or 3 or more misdemeanors committed in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Authorized travel and employment during temporary residence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the period an alien is in lawful temporary resident status granted under this subsection, the alien has the right to travel abroad (including commutation from a residence abroad) and shall be granted authorization to engage in employment in the United States and shall be provided an &ldquo;employment authorized&rdquo; endorsement or other appropriate work permit, in the same manner as for aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, an alien who acquires the status of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence under paragraph (1), such status not having changed, is considered to be an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence (as described in section 1101(a)(20) of this title), other than under any provision of the immigration laws.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Applications for adjustment of status</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) To whom may be made</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Within the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General shall provide that applications for adjustment of status under subsection (a) may be filed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) with the Attorney General, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) with a designated entity (designated under paragraph (2)), but only if the applicant consents to the forwarding of the application to the Attorney General.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Outside the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General, in cooperation with the Secretary of State, shall provide a procedure whereby an alien may apply for adjustment of status under subsection (a)(1) of this section at an appropriate consular office outside the United States. If the alien otherwise qualifies for such adjustment, the Attorney General shall provide such documentation of authorization to enter the United States and to have the alien's status adjusted upon entry as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Designation of entities to receive applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of receiving applications under this section, the Attorney General&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall designate qualified voluntary organizations and other qualified State, local, community, farm labor organizations, and associations of agricultural employers, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may designate such other persons as the Attorney General determines are qualified and have substantial experience, demonstrated competence, and traditional long-<!-- PDFPage:79 -->term involvement in the preparation and submittal of applications for adjustment of status under section 1159 or 1255 of this title, Public Law 89&ndash;732 [8 U.S.C. 1255 note], or Public Law 95&ndash;145 [8 U.S.C. 1255 note].</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Proof of eligibility</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An alien may establish that he meets the requirement of subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section through government employment records, records supplied by employers or collective bargaining organizations, and such other reliable documentation as the alien may provide. The Attorney General shall establish special procedures to credit properly work in cases in which an alien was employed under an assumed name.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Documentation of work history</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) An alien applying for adjustment of status under subsection (a)(1) of this section has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the alien has worked the requisite number of man-days (as required under subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) If an employer or farm labor contractor employing such an alien has kept proper and adequate records respecting such employment, the alien's burden of proof under clause (i) may be met by securing timely production of those records under regulations to be promulgated by the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) An alien can meet such burden of proof if the alien establishes that the alien has in fact performed the work described in subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section by producing sufficient evidence to show the extent of that employment as a matter of just and reasonable inference. In such a case, the burden then shifts to the Attorney General to disprove the alien's evidence with a showing which negates the reasonableness of the inference to be drawn from the evidence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of applications by designated entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each designated entity must agree to forward to the Attorney General applications filed with it in accordance with paragraph (1)(A)(ii) but not to forward to the Attorney General applications filed with it unless the applicant has consented to such forwarding. No such entity may make a determination required by this section to be made by the Attorney General.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Limitation on access to information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Files and records prepared for purposes of this section by designated entities operating under this section are confidential and the Attorney General and the Service shall not have access to such files or records relating to an alien without the consent of the alien.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Confidentiality of information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Neither the Attorney General, nor any other official or employee of the Department of Justice, or bureau or agency thereof, may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) use the information furnished pursuant to an application filed under this section for any purpose other than to make a determination on the application including a determination under subparagraph&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1160_1_target" name="1160_1">1</a></sup> (a)(3)(B), or for enforcement of paragraph (7).<sup><a href="#1160_2_target" name="1160_2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) make any publication whereby the information furnished by any particular individual can be identified, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) permit anyone other than the sworn officers and employees of the Department or bureau or agency or, with respect to applications filed with a designated entity, that designated entity, to examine individual applications.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Anyone who uses, publishes, or permits information to be examined in violation of this paragraph shall be fined in accordance with title 18 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Penalties for false statements in applications</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Criminal penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Whoever&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) files an application for adjustment of status under this section and knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up a material fact or makes any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) creates or supplies a false writing or document for use in making such an application,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">shall be fined in accordance with title 18 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exclusion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An alien who is convicted of a crime under subparagraph (A) shall be considered to be inadmissible to the United States on the ground described in section 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Waiver of numerical limitations and certain grounds for exclusion</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Numerical limitations do not apply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The numerical limitations of sections 1151 and 1152 of this title shall not apply to the adjustment of aliens to lawful permanent resident status under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Waiver of grounds for exclusion</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">An alien is not ineligible for adjustment of status under this section due to being inadmissible under section 1182(a)(4) of this title if the alien demonstrates a history of employment in the United States evidencing self-support without reliance on public cash assistance.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Temporary disqualification of newly legalized aliens from receiving aid to families with dependent children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During the five-year period beginning on the date an alien was granted lawful temporary resident status under subsection (a) of this section, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the alien is not eligible for aid under a State plan approved under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.]. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in the case of an alien who would be eligible for aid under a State plan approved under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act but for the previous sentence, the provisions of paragraph (3) of section 1255a(h) of this title shall apply in the same manner as they apply with respect to paragraph (1) of such section and, for this purpose, any reference in section 1255a(h)(3) of this title to paragraph (1) is deemed a reference to the previous sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Treatment of special agricultural workers</h4>
