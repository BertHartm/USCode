<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Proceeding</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An immigration judge shall conduct proceedings for deciding the inadmissibility or deportability of an alien.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An alien placed in proceedings under this section may be charged with any applicable ground of inadmissibility under section 1182(a) of this title or any applicable ground of deportability under section 1227(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exclusive procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, a proceeding under this section shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining whether an alien may be admitted to the United States or, if the alien has been so admitted, removed from the United States. Nothing in this section shall affect proceedings conducted pursuant to section 1228 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conduct of proceeding</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority of immigration judge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The immigration judge shall administer oaths, receive evidence, and interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien and any witnesses. The immigration judge may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and presentation of evidence. The immigration judge shall have authority (under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General) to sanction by civil money penalty any action (or inaction) in contempt of the judge's proper exercise of authority under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Form of proceeding</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The proceeding may take place&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in person,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) where agreed to by the parties, in the absence of the alien,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) through video conference, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) subject to subparagraph (B), through telephone conference.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Consent required in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An evidentiary hearing on the merits may only be conducted through a telephone conference with the consent of the alien involved after the alien has been advised of the right to proceed in person or through video conference.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Presence of alien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If it is impracticable by reason of an alien's mental incompetency for the alien to be <!-- PDFPage:191 -->present at the proceeding, the Attorney General shall prescribe safeguards to protect the rights and privileges of the alien.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Alien's rights in proceeding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In proceedings under this section, under regulations of the Attorney General&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the alien shall have the privilege of being represented, at no expense to the Government, by counsel of the alien's choosing who is authorized to practice in such proceedings,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against the alien, to present evidence on the alien's own behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the Government but these rights shall not entitle the alien to examine such national security information as the Government may proffer in opposition to the alien's admission to the United States or to an application by the alien for discretionary relief under this chapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a complete record shall be kept of all testimony and evidence produced at the proceeding.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Consequences of failure to appear</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any alien who, after written notice required under paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a) of this title has been provided to the alien or the alien's counsel of record, does not attend a proceeding under this section, shall be ordered removed in absentia if the Service establishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the written notice was so provided and that the alien is removable (as defined in subsection (e)(2) of this section). The written notice by the Attorney General shall be considered sufficient for purposes of this subparagraph if provided at the most recent address provided under section 1229(a)(1)(F) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) No notice if failure to provide address information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No written notice shall be required under subparagraph (A) if the alien has failed to provide the address required under section 1229(a)(1)(F) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Rescission of order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such an order may be rescinded only&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection (e)(1) of this section), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a) of this title or the alien demonstrates that the alien was in Federal or State custody and the failure to appear was through no fault of the alien.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The filing of the motion to reopen described in clause (i) or (ii) shall stay the removal of the alien pending disposition of the motion by the immigration judge.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Effect on judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any petition for review under section 1252 of this title of an order entered in absentia under this paragraph shall (except in cases described in section 1252(b)(5) of this title) be confined to (i) the validity of the notice provided to the alien, (ii) the reasons for the alien's not attending the proceeding, and (iii) whether or not the alien is removable.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Additional application to certain aliens in contiguous territory</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The preceding provisions of this paragraph shall apply to all aliens placed in proceedings under this section, including any alien who remains in a contiguous foreign territory pursuant to section 1225(b)(2)(C) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Treatment of frivolous behavior</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall, by regulation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) define in a proceeding before an immigration judge or before an appellate administrative body under this subchapter, frivolous behavior for which attorneys may be sanctioned,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) specify the circumstances under which an administrative appeal of a decision or ruling will be considered frivolous and will be summarily dismissed, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) impose appropriate sanctions (which may include suspension and disbarment) in the case of frivolous behavior.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as limiting the authority of the Attorney General to take actions with respect to inappropriate behavior.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Limitation on discretionary relief for failure to appear</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any alien against whom a final order of removal is entered in absentia under this subsection and who, at the time of the notice described in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a) of this title, was provided oral notice, either in the alien's native language or in another language the alien understands, of the time and place of the proceedings and of the consequences under this paragraph of failing, other than because of exceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection (e)(1) of this section) to attend a proceeding under this section, shall not be eligible for relief under section 1229b, 1229c, 1255, 1258, or 1259 of this title for a period of 10 years after the date of the entry of the final order of removal.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certain medical decisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a medical officer or civil surgeon or board of medical officers has certified under section 1222(b) of this title that an alien has <!-- PDFPage:192 -->a disease, illness, or addiction which would make the alien inadmissible under paragraph (1) of section 1182(a) of this title, the decision of the immigration judge shall be based solely upon such certification.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Burden on alien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the proceeding the alien has the burden of establishing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if the alien is an applicant for admission, that the alien is clearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted and is not inadmissible under section 1182 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by clear and convincing evidence, that the alien is lawfully present in the United States pursuant to a prior admission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In meeting the burden of proof under subparagraph (B), the alien shall have access to the alien's visa or other entry document, if any, and any other records and documents, not considered by the Attorney General to be confidential, pertaining to the alien's admission or presence in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Burden on service in cases of deportable aliens</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the proceeding the Service has the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that, in the case of an alien who has been admitted to the United States, the alien is deportable.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any proceeding under this chapter, any record of conviction or abstract that has been submitted by electronic means to the Service from a State or court shall be admissible as evidence to prove a criminal conviction if it is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) certified by a State official associated with the State's repository of criminal justice records as an official record from its repository or by a court official from the court in which the conviction was entered as an official record from its repository, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) certified in writing by a Service official as having been received electronically from the State's record repository or the court's record repository.</p>
