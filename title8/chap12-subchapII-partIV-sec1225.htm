<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Inspection</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Aliens treated as applicants for admission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An alien present in the United States who has not been admitted or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international or United States waters) shall be deemed for purposes of this chapter an applicant for admission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Stowaways</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An arriving alien who is a stowaway is not eligible to apply for admission or to be admitted and shall be ordered removed upon inspection by an immigration officer. Upon such inspection if the alien indicates an intention to apply for asylum under section 1158 of this title or a fear of persecution, the officer shall refer the alien for an interview under subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section. A stowaway may apply for asylum only if the stowaway is found to have a credible fear of persecution under subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section. In no case may a stowaway be considered an applicant for admission or eligible for a hearing under section 1229a of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Inspection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All aliens (including alien crewmen) who are applicants for admission or otherwise seeking admission or readmission to or transit through the United States shall be inspected by immigration officers.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inspection of applicants for admission</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Screening</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Claims for asylum</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If an immigration officer determines that an alien (other than an alien described in subparagraph (F)) who is arriving in the United States or is described in clause (iii) is inadmissible under section 1182(a)(6)(C) or 1182(a)(7) of this title and the alien indicates either an intention to apply for asylum under section 1158 of this title or a fear of persecution, the officer shall refer the alien for an interview by an asylum officer under subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Application to certain other aliens</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The Attorney General may apply clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph to any or all aliens described in subclause (II) as designated by the Attorney General.

<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Aliens described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">An alien described in this clause is an alien who is not described in subpara<!-- PDFPage:229 -->graph (F), who has not been admitted or paroled into the United States, and who has not affirmatively shown, to the satisfaction of an immigration officer, that the alien has been physically present in the United States continuously for the 2-year period immediately prior to the date of the determination of inadmissibility under this subparagraph.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Removal without further review if no credible fear of persecution</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">Subject to subclause (III), if the officer determines that an alien does not have a credible fear of persecution, the officer shall order the alien removed from the United States without further hearing or review.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Record of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The officer shall prepare a written record of a determination under subclause (I). Such record shall include a summary of the material facts as stated by the applicant, such additional facts (if any) relied upon by the officer, and the officer's analysis of why, in the light of such facts, the alien has not established a credible fear of persecution. A copy of the officer's interview notes shall be attached to the written summary.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(III) Review of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The Attorney General shall provide by regulation and upon the alien's request for prompt review by an immigration judge of a determination under subclause (I) that the alien does not have a credible fear of persecution. Such review shall include an opportunity for the alien to be heard and questioned by the immigration judge, either in person or by telephonic or video connection. Review shall be concluded as expeditiously as possible, to the maximum extent practicable within 24 hours, but in no case later than 7 days after the date of the determination under subclause (I).</p>

Such consultation shall be at no expense to the Government and shall not unreasonably delay the process.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(v) &ldquo;Credible fear of persecution&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;credible fear of persecution&rdquo; means that there is a significant possibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the alien in support of the alien's claim and such other facts as are known to the officer, that the alien could establish eligibility for asylum under section 1158 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitation on administrative review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B)(iii)(III), a removal order entered in accordance with subparagraph (A)(i) or (B)(iii)(I) is not subject to administrative appeal, except that the Attorney General shall provide by regulation for prompt review of such an order under subparagraph (A)(i) against an alien who claims under oath, or as permitted under penalty of perjury under section 1746 of title 28, after having been warned of the penalties for falsely making such claim under such conditions, to have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence, to have been admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of this title, or to have been granted asylum under section 1158 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Limit on collateral attacks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any action brought against an alien under section 1325(a) of this title or section 1326 of this title, the court shall not have jurisdiction to hear any claim attacking the validity of an order of removal entered under subparagraph (A)(i) or (B)(iii).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is supervised by an officer who meets the condition described in clause (i) and has had substantial experience adjudicating asylum applications.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:230 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Inspection of other aliens</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), in the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission, if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a proceeding under section 1229a of this title.</p>
