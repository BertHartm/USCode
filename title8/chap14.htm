<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1601. Statements of national policy concerning welfare and immigration</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following statements concerning national policy with respect to welfare and immigration:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United States immigration law since this country's earliest immigration statutes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) It continues to be the immigration policy of the United States that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) aliens within the Nation's borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families, their sponsors, and private organizations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the availability of public benefits not constitute an incentive for immigration to the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Despite the principle of self-sufficiency, aliens have been applying for and receiving public benefits from Federal, State, and local governments at increasing rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Current eligibility rules for public assistance and unenforceable financial support agreements have proved wholly incapable of assuring that individual aliens not burden the public benefits system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) It is a compelling government interest to enact new rules for eligibility and sponsorship agreements in order to assure that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) It is a compelling government interest to remove the incentive for illegal immigration provided by the availability of public benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) With respect to the State authority to make determinations concerning the eligibility of qualified aliens for public benefits in this chapter, a State that chooses to follow the Federal classification in determining the eligibility of such aliens for public assistance shall be considered to have chosen the least restrictive means available for achieving the compelling governmental interest of assuring that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (b) of this section and notwithstanding any other provision of law, a State or political subdivision of a State is authorized to prohibit or otherwise limit or restrict the eligibility of aliens or classes of aliens for programs of general cash public assistance furnished under the law of the State or a political subdivision of a State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The authority provided for under subsection (a) of this section may be exercised only to the extent that any prohibitions, limitations, or restrictions imposed by a State or political subdivision of a State are not more restrictive than the prohibitions, limitations, or restrictions imposed under comparable Federal programs. For purposes of this section, attribution to an alien of a sponsor's income and resources (as described in section 1631 of this title) for purposes of determining eligibility for, and the amount of, benefits shall be considered less restrictive than a prohibition of eligibility for such benefits.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Duration of attribution period</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If on August 22, 1996, a Federal means-tested public benefits program attributes a sponsor's income and resources to an alien in determining the alien's eligibility and the amount of benefits for an alien, this section shall apply to any such determination beginning on the day after August 22, 1996.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If on August 22, 1996, a Federal means-tested public benefits program does not attribute a sponsor's income and resources to an alien in determining the alien's eligibility and the amount of benefits for an alien, this section shall apply to any such determination beginning 180 days after August 22, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Indigence exception</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For an alien for whom an affidavit of support under section 213A of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1183a] has been executed, if a determination described in paragraph (2) is made, the amount of income and resources of the sponsor or the sponsor's spouse which shall be attributed to the sponsored alien shall not exceed the amount actually provided for a period beginning on the date of such determination and ending 12 months after such date.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A determination described in this paragraph is a determination by an agency that a sponsored alien would, in the absence of the assistance provided by the agency, be unable to obtain food and shelter, taking into account the alien's own income, plus any cash, food, housing, or other assistance provided by other individuals, including the sponsor.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) after a 12 month period (regarding the batterer's income and resources only) if the alien demonstrates that such battery or cruelty under subparagraph (A) has been recognized in an order of a judge or administrative law judge or a prior determination of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and that such battery or cruelty (in the opinion of the agency providing such public benefits, which opinion is not subject to review by any court) has a substantial connection to the need for the benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The exception under paragraph (1) shall not apply to benefits for an alien during any period in which the individual responsible for such battery or cruelty resides in the same household or family eligibility unit as the individual who was subjected to such battery or cruelty.</p>
