<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Arrest and custody; review of determination by court; aliens committing aggravated felonies; report to Congressional committees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Pending a determination of deportability in the case of any alien as provided in subsection (b) of this section, such alien may, upon warrant of the Attorney General, be arrested and taken into custody. Except as provided in paragraph (2), any such alien taken into custody may, in the discretion of the Attorney General and pending such final determination of deportability, (A) be continued in custody; or (B) be released under bond in the amount of not less than $500 with security approved by the Attorney General, containing such conditions as the Attorney General may prescribe; or (C) be released on conditional parole. But such bond or parole, whether heretofore or hereafter authorized, may be revoked at any time by the Attorney General, in his discretion, and the alien may be returned to custody under the warrant which initiated the proceedings against him and detained until final determination of his deportability. Any court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to review or revise any determination of the Attorney General concerning detention, release on bond, or parole pending final decision of deportability upon a conclusive showing in habeas corpus proceedings that the Attorney General is not proceeding with such reasonable dispatch as may be warranted by the particular facts and circumstances in the case of any alien to determine deportability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Attorney General shall take into custody any alien convicted of an aggravated felony upon release of the alien (regardless of whether or not such release is on parole, supervised release, or probation, and regardless of the possibility of rearrest or further confinement in respect of the same offense). Notwithstanding paragraph (1) or subsections (c) and (d) of this section but subject to subparagraph (B), the Attorney General shall not release such felon from custody.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Attorney General may not release from custody any lawfully admitted alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony, either before or after a determination of deportability, unless the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that such alien is not a threat to the community and that the alien is likely to appear before any scheduled hearings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Attorney General shall devise and implement a system&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to make available, daily (on a 24-hour basis), to Federal, State, and local authorities the investigative resources of the Service to determine whether individuals arrested by such authorities for aggravated felonies are aliens;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to designate and train officers and employees of the Service within each district to serve as a liaison to Federal, State, and local <!-- PDFPage:148 -->law enforcement and correctional agencies and courts with respect to the arrest, conviction, and release of any alien charged with an aggravated felony; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) which uses computer resources to maintain a current record of aliens who have been convicted of an aggravated felony and who have been deported; such record shall be made available to inspectors at ports of entry and to border patrol agents at sector headquarters for purposes of immediate identification of any such previously deported alien seeking to reenter the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Attorney General shall submit reports to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate at the end of the 6-month period and at the end of the 18-month period beginning on the effective date of this paragraph which describe in detail specific efforts made by the Attorney General to implement this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Proceedings to determine deportability; removal expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A special inquiry officer shall conduct proceedings under this section to determine the deportability of any alien, and shall administer oaths, present and receive evidence, interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien or witnesses, and, as authorized by the Attorney General, shall make determinations, including orders of deportation. Determination of deportability in any case shall be made only upon a record made in a proceeding before a special inquiry officer, at which the alien shall have reasonable opportunity to be present, unless by reason of the alien's mental incompetency it is impracticable for him to be present, in which case the Attorney General shall prescribe necessary and proper safeguards for the rights and privileges of such alien. If any alien has been given a reasonable opportunity to be present at a proceeding under this section, and without reasonable cause fails or refuses to attend or remain in attendance at such proceeding, the special inquiry officer may proceed to a determination in like manner as if the alien were present. In any case or class of cases in which the Attorney General believes that such procedure would be of aid in making a determination, he may require specifically or by regulation that an additional immigration officer shall be assigned to present the evidence on behalf of the United States and in such case such additional immigration officer shall have authority to present evidence, and to interrogate, examine and cross-examine the alien or other witnesses in the proceedings. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed to diminish the authority conferred upon the special inquiry officer conducting such proceedings. No special inquiry officer shall conduct a proceeding in any case under this section in which he shall have participated in investigative functions or in which he shall have participated (except as provided in this subsection) in prosecuting functions. Proceedings before a special inquiry officer acting under the provisions of this section shall be in accordance with such regulations, not inconsistent with this chapter, as the Attorney General shall prescribe. Such regulations shall include requirements that are consistent with section 1252b of this title and that provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the alien shall be given notice, reasonable under all the circumstances, of the nature of the charges against him and of the time and place at which the proceedings will be held,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the alien shall have the privilege of being represented (at no expense to the Government) by such counsel, authorized to practice in such proceedings, as he shall choose,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against him, to present evidence on his own behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the Government, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) no decision of deportability shall be valid unless it is based upon reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Except as provided in section 1252a(d) of this title, the procedure so prescribed shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining the deportability of an alien under this section. In any case in which an alien is ordered deported from the United States under the provisions of this chapter, or of any other law or treaty, the decision of the Attorney General shall be final. In the discretion of the Attorney General, and under such regulations as he may prescribe, deportation proceedings, including issuance of a warrant of arrest, and a finding of deportability under this section need not be required in the case of any alien who admits to belonging to a class of aliens who are deportable under section 1251 of this title if such alien voluntarily departs from the United States at his own expense, or is removed at Government expense as hereinafter authorized, unless the Attorney General has reason to believe that such alien is deportable under paragraph (2), (3), or (4) of section 1251(a) of this title. If any alien who is authorized to depart voluntarily under the preceding sentence is financially unable to depart at his own expense and the Attorney General deems his removal to be in the best interest of the United States, the expense of such removal may be paid from the appropriation for the enforcement of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Final order of deportation; place of detention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When a final order of deportation under administrative processes is made against any alien, the Attorney General shall have a period of six months from the date of such order, or, if judicial review is had, then from the date of the final order of the court, within which to effect the alien's departure from the United States, during which period, at the Attorney General's discretion, the alien may be detained, released on bond in an amount and containing such conditions as the Attorney General may prescribe, or released on such other condition as the Attorney General may prescribe. Any court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to review or revise any determination of the Attorney General concerning detention, release on bond, or other release during such six-month period upon a conclusive showing in habeas corpus proceedings that the Attorney General is not proceeding with such reasonable dispatch as may be warranted by the particular facts and circumstances in the case of any alien to effect <!-- PDFPage:149 -->such alien's departure from the United States within such six-month period. If deportation has not been practicable, advisable, or possible, or departure of the alien from the United States under the order of deportation has not been effected, within such six-month period, the alien shall become subject to such further supervision and detention pending eventual deportation as is authorized in this section. The Attorney General is authorized and directed to arrange for appropriate places of detention for those aliens whom he shall take into custody and detain under this section. Where no Federal buildings are available or buildings adapted or suitably located for the purpose are available for rental, the Attorney General is authorized, notwithstanding section 5 of title 41 or section 278a&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1252_1_target" name="1252_1">1</a></sup> of title 40 to expend, from the appropriation provided for the administration and enforcement of the immigration laws, such amounts as may be necessary for the acquisition of land and the erection, acquisition, maintenance, operation, remodeling, or repair of buildings, sheds, and office quarters (including living quarters for officers where none are otherwise available), and adjunct facilities, necessary for the detention of aliens. For the purposes of this section an order of deportation heretofore or hereafter entered against an alien in legal detention or confinement, other than under an immigration process, shall be considered as being made as of the moment he is released from such detention or confinement, and not prior thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Supervision of deportable alien; violation by alien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any alien, against whom a final order of deportation as defined in subsection (c) of this section heretofore or hereafter issued has been outstanding for more than six months, shall, pending eventual deportation, be subject to supervision under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General. Such regulations shall include provisions which will require any alien subject to supervision (1) to appear from time to time before an immigration officer for identification; (2) to submit, if necessary, to medical and psychiatric examination at the expense of the United States; (3) to give information under oath as to his nationality, circumstances, habits, associations, and activities, and such other information, whether or not related to the foregoing, as the Attorney General may deem fit and proper; and (4) to conform to such reasonable written restrictions on his conduct or activities as are prescribed by the Attorney General in his case. Any alien who shall willfully fail to comply with such regulations, or willfully fail to appear or to give information or submit to medical or psychiatric examination if required, or knowingly give false information in relation to the requirements of such regulations, or knowingly violate a reasonable restriction imposed upon his conduct or activity, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or shall be imprisoned not more than one year, or both.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Penalty for willful failure to depart; suspension of sentence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any alien against whom a final order of deportation is outstanding by reason of being a member of any of the classes described in section 1251(a) of this title, who shall willfully fail or refuse to depart from the United States within a period of six months from the date of the final order of deportation under administrative processes, or, if judicial review is had, then from the date of the final order of the court, or shall willfully fail or refuse to make timely application in good faith for travel or other documents necessary to his departure, or who shall connive or conspire, or take any other action, designed to prevent or hamper or with the purpose of preventing or hampering his departure pursuant to such order of deportation, or who shall willfully fail or refuse to present himself for deportation at the time and place required by the Attorney General pursuant to such order of deportation, shall upon conviction be guilty of a felony, and shall be imprisoned not more than four years, or shall be imprisoned not more than ten years if the alien is a member of any of the classes described in paragraph (1)(E), (2), (3), or (4) of section 1251(a) of this title.:&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1252_2_target" name="1252_2">2</a></sup> <em>Provided</em>, That this subsection shall not make it illegal for any alien to take any proper steps for the purpose of securing cancellation of or exemption from such order of deportation or for the purpose of securing his release from incarceration or custody: <em>Provided further</em>, That the court may for good cause suspend the sentence of such alien and order his release under such conditions as the court may prescribe. In determining whether good cause has been shown to justify releasing the alien, the court shall take into account such factors as (1) the age, health, and period of detention of the alien; (2) the effect of the alien's release upon the national security and public peace or safety; (3) the likelihood of the alien's resuming or following a course of conduct which made or would make him deportable; (4) the character of the efforts made by such alien himself and by representatives of the country or countries to which his deportation is directed to expedite the alien's departure from the United States; (5) the reason for the inability of the Government of the United States to secure passports, other travel documents, or deportation facilities from the country or countries to which the alien has been ordered deported; and (6) the eligibility of the alien for discretionary relief under the immigration laws.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Unlawful reentry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Should the Attorney General find that any alien has unlawfully reentered the United States after having previously departed or been deported pursuant to an order of deportation, whether before or after June 27, 1952, on any ground described in any of the paragraphs enumerated in subsection (e) of this section, the previous order of deportation shall be deemed to be reinstated from its original date and such alien shall be deported under such previous order at any time subsequent to such reentry. For the purposes of subsection (e) of this section the date on which the finding is made that such reinstatement is appropriate shall be deemed the date of the final order of deportation.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:150 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Voluntary deportation; payment of expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any alien, subject to supervision or detention under subsections (c) or (d) of this section, is able to depart from the United States under the order of deportation, except that he is financially unable to pay his passage, the Attorney General may in his discretion permit such alien to depart voluntarily, and the expense of such passage to the country to which he is destined may be paid from the appropriation for the enforcement of this chapter, unless such payment is otherwise provided for under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Service of prison sentence prior to deportation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An alien sentenced to imprisonment shall not be deported until such imprisonment has been terminated by the release of the alien from confinement. Parole, supervised release, probation, or possibility of rearrest or further confinement in respect of the same offense shall not be a ground for deferral of deportation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Expeditious deportation of convicted aliens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an alien who is convicted of an offense which makes the alien subject to deportation, the Attorney General shall begin any deportation proceeding as expeditiously as possible after the date of the conviction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Incarceration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the chief executive officer of a State (or, if appropriate, a political subdivision of the State) exercising authority with respect to the incarceration of an undocumented criminal alien submits a written request to the Attorney General, the Attorney General shall, as determined by the Attorney General&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) enter into a contractual arrangement which provides for compensation to the State or a political subdivision of the State, as may be appropriate, with respect to the incarceration of the undocumented criminal alien; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) take the undocumented criminal alien into the custody of the Federal Government and incarcerate the alien.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Compensation under paragraph (1)(A) shall be the average cost of incarceration of a prisoner in the relevant State as determined by the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;undocumented criminal alien&rdquo; means an alien who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has been convicted of a felony and sentenced to a term of imprisonment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) entered the United States without inspection or at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) was the subject of exclusion or deportation proceedings at the time he or she was taken into custody by the State or a political subdivision of the State; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) was admitted as a nonimmigrant and at the time he or she was taken into custody by the State or a political subdivision of the State has failed to maintain the nonimmigrant status in which the alien was admitted or to which it was changed under section 1258 of this title, or to comply with the conditions of any such status.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) In carrying out paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall give priority to the Federal incarceration of undocumented criminal aliens who have committed aggravated felonies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Attorney General shall ensure that undocumented criminal aliens incarcerated in Federal facilities pursuant to this subsection are held in facilities which provide a level of security appropriate to the crimes for which they were convicted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this subsection, of which the following amounts may be appropriated from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) $130,000,000 for fiscal year 1995;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $300,000,000 for fiscal year 1996;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) $330,000,000 for fiscal year 1997;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) $350,000,000 for fiscal year 1998;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1252a. Expedited deportation of aliens convicted of committing aggravated felonies</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Deportation of criminal aliens</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) in general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall provide for the availability of special deportation proceedings at certain Federal, State, and local correctional facilities for aliens convicted of aggravated felonies (as defined in section 1101(a)(43) of this title). Such proceedings shall be conducted in conformity with section 1252 of this title (except as otherwise provided in this section), and in a manner which eliminates the need for additional detention at any processing center of the Service and in a manner which assures expeditious deportation, where warranted, following the end of the alien's incarceration for the underlying sentence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to an alien convicted of an aggravated felony who is taken into custody by the Attorney General pursuant to section 1252(a)(2) of this title, the Attorney General shall, to the maximum extent practicable, detain any such felon at a facility at which other such aliens are detained. In the selection of such facility, the Attorney General shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the alien's access to counsel and right to counsel under section 1362 of this title are not impaired.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Expedited proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Attorney General shall provide for <!-- PDFPage:153 -->the initiation and, to the extent possible, the completion of deportation proceedings, and any administrative appeals thereof, in the case of any alien convicted of an aggravated felony before the alien's release from incarceration for the underlying aggravated felony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the Attorney General to effect the deportation of any alien sentenced to actual incarceration, before release from the penitentiary or correctional institution where such alien is confined.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Attorney General shall review and evaluate deportation proceedings conducted under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Comptroller General shall monitor, review, and evaluate deportation proceedings conducted under this section. Within 18 months after the effective date of this section, the Comptroller General shall submit a report to such Committees concerning the extent to which deportation proceedings conducted under this section may adversely affect the ability of such aliens to contest deportation effectively.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deportation of aliens who are not permanent residents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Attorney General may, in the case of an alien described in paragraph (2), determine the deportability of such alien under section 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii) of this title (relating to conviction of an aggravated felony) and issue an order of deportation pursuant to the procedures set forth in this subsection or section 1252(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An alien is described in this paragraph if the alien&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) was not lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time at which proceedings under this section commenced; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is not eligible for any relief from deportation under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Attorney General may not execute any order described in paragraph (1) until 30 calendar days have passed from the date that such order was issued, unless waived by the alien, in order that the alien has an opportunity to apply for judicial review under section 1105a of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Proceedings before the Attorney General under this subsection shall be in accordance with such regulations as the Attorney General shall prescribe. The Attorney General shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the alien is given reasonable notice of the charges and of the opportunity described in subparagraph (C);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the alien shall have the privilege of being represented (at no expense to the government) by such counsel, authorized to practice in such proccedings, as the alien shall choose;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the alien has a reasonable opportunity to inspect the evidence and rebut the charges;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a record is maintained for judicial review; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the final order of deportation is not adjudicated by the same person who issues the charges.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Repealed. Pub. L. 103&ndash;322, title XIII, &sect;130004(c)(4), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2028</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Judicial deportation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a United States district court shall have jurisdiction to enter a judicial order of deportation at the time of sentencing against an alien whose criminal conviction causes such alien to be deportable under section 1251(a)(2)(A) of this title, if such an order has been requested by the United States Attorney with the concurrence of the Commissioner and if the court chooses to exercise such jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The United States Attorney shall file with the United States district court, and serve upon the defendant and the Service, prior to commencement of the trial or entry of a guilty plea a notice of intent to request judicial deportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notwithstanding section 1252b of this title, the United States Attorney, with the concurrence of the Commissioner, shall file at least 30 days prior to the date set for sentencing a charge containing factual allegations regarding the alienage of the defendant and identifying the crime or crimes which make the defendant deportable under section 1251(a)(2)(A) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) If the court determines that the defendant has presented substantial evidence to establish prima facie eligibility for relief from deportation under this chapter, the Commissioner shall provide the court with a recommendation and report regarding the alien's eligibility for relief. The court shall either grant or deny the relief sought.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D)(i) The alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against him or her, to present evidence on his or her own behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The court, for the purposes of determining whether to enter an order described in paragraph (1), shall only consider evidence that would be admissible in proceedings conducted pursuant to section 1252(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Nothing in this subsection shall limit the information a court of the United States may receive or consider for the purposes of imposing an appropriate sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) The court may order the alien deported if the Attorney General demonstrates that the alien is deportable under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice, appeal, and execution of judicial order of deportation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) A judicial order of deportation or denial of such order may be appealed by either party to the court of appeals for the circuit in which the district court is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Except as provided in clause (iii), such appeal shall be considered consistent with the requirements described in section 1105a of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Upon execution by the defendant of a valid waiver of the right to appeal the convic<!-- PDFPage:154 -->tion on which the order of deportation is based, the expiration of the period described in section 1105a(a)(1) of this title, or the final dismissal of an appeal from such conviction, the order of deportation shall become final and shall be executed at the end of the prison term in accordance with the terms of the order. If the conviction is reversed on direct appeal, the order entered pursuant to this section shall be void.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) As soon as is practicable after entry of a judicial order of deportation, the Commissioner shall provide the defendant with written notice of the order of deportation, which shall designate the defendant's country of choice for deportation and any alternate country pursuant to section 1253(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Denial of judicial order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Denial without a decision on the merits of a request for a judicial order of deportation shall not preclude the Attorney General from initiating deportation proceedings pursuant to section 1252 of this title upon the same ground of deportability or upon any other ground of deportability provided under section 1251(a) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The deportation of an alien in the United States provided for in this chapter, or any other Act or treaty, shall be directed by the Attorney General to a country promptly designated by the alien if that country is willing to accept him into its territory, unless the Attorney General, in his discretion, concludes that deportation to such country would be prejudicial to the interests of the United States. No alien shall be permitted to make more than one such designation, nor shall any alien designate, as the place to which he wishes to be deported, any foreign territory contiguous to the United States or any island adjacent thereto or adjacent to the United States unless such alien is a native, citizen, subject, or national of, or had a residence in such designated foreign contiguous territory or adjacent island. If the government of the country designated by the alien fails finally to advise the Attorney General within three months following original inquiry whether that government will or will not accept such alien into its territory, such designation may thereafter be disregarded. Thereupon deportation of such alien shall be directed to any country of which such alien is a subject, national, or citizen if such country is willing to accept him into its territory. If the government of such country fails finally to advise the Attorney General or the alien within three months following the date of original inquiry, or within such other period as the Attorney General shall deem reasonable under the circumstances in a particular case, whether that government will or will not accept such alien into its territory, then such deportation shall be directed by the Attorney General within his discretion and without necessarily giving any priority or preference because of their order as herein set forth either&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Granting of status</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an alien who is a national of a foreign state designated under subsection (b) of this section (or in the case of an alien having no nationality, is a person who last habitually resided in such designated state) and who meets the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, the Attorney General, in accordance with this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may grant the alien temporary protected status in the United States and shall not deport the alien from the United States during the period in which such status is in effect, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall authorize the alien to engage in employment in the United States and provide the alien with an &ldquo;employment authorized&rdquo; endorsement or other appropriate work permit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Duration of work authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Work authorization provided under this section shall be effective throughout the period the alien is in temporary protected status under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Upon the granting of temporary protected status under this section, the Attorney General shall provide the alien with information concerning such status under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If, at the time of initiation of a deportation proceeding against an alien, the foreign state (of which the alien is a national) is designated under subsection (b) of this section, <!-- PDFPage:163 -->the Attorney General shall promptly notify the alien of the temporary protected status that may be available under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) If, at the time of designation of a foreign state under subsection (b) of this section, an alien (who is a national of such state) is in a deportation proceeding under this subchapter, the Attorney General shall promptly notify the alien of the temporary protected status that may be available under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Notices under this paragraph shall be provided in a form and language that the alien can understand.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Temporary treatment for eligible aliens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the case of an alien who can establish a prima facie case of eligibility for benefits under paragraph (1), but for the fact that the period of registration under subsection (c)(1)(A)(iv) of this section has not begun, until the alien has had a reasonable opportunity to register during the first 30 days of such period, the Attorney General shall provide for the benefits of paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In the case of an alien who establishes a prima facie case of eligibility for benefits under paragraph (1), until a final determination with respect to the alien's eligibility for such benefits under paragraph (1) has been made, the alien shall be provided such benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Clarification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing the Attorney General to deny temporary protected status to an alien based on the alien's immigration status or to require any alien, as a condition of being granted such status, either to relinquish nonimmigrant or other status the alien may have or to execute any waiver of other rights under this chapter. The granting of temporary protected status under this section shall not be considered to be inconsistent with the granting of nonimmigrant status under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Designations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General, after consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government, may designate any foreign state (or any part of such foreign state) under this subsection only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Attorney General finds that there is an ongoing armed conflict within the state and, due to such conflict, requiring the return of aliens who are nationals of that state to that state (or to the part of the state) would pose a serious threat to their personal safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Attorney General finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) there has been an earthquake, flood, drought, epidemic, or other environmental disaster in the state resulting in a substantial, but temporary, disruption of living conditions in the area affected,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the foreign state is unable, temporarily, to handle adequately the return to the state of aliens who are nationals of the state, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the foreign state officially has requested designation under this subparagraph; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Attorney General finds that there exist extraordinary and temporary conditions in the foreign state that prevent aliens who are nationals of the state from returning to the state in safety, unless the Attorney General finds that permitting the aliens to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to the national interest of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A designation of a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) under this paragraph shall not become effective unless notice of the designation (including a statement of the findings under this paragraph and the effective date of the designation) is published in the Federal Register. In such notice, the Attorney General shall also state an estimate of the number of nationals of the foreign state designated who are (or within the effective period of the designation are likely to become) eligible for temporary protected status under this section and their immigration status in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effective period of designation for foreign states</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The designation of a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) under paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) take effect upon the date of publication of the designation under such paragraph, or such later date as the Attorney General may specify in the notice published under such paragraph, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall remain in effect until the effective date of the termination of the designation under paragraph (3)(B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this section, the initial period of designation of a foreign state (or part thereof) under paragraph (1) is the period, specified by the Attorney General, of not less than 6 months and not more than 18 months.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Periodic review, terminations, and extensions of designations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Periodic review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">At least 60 days before end of the initial period of designation, and any extended period of designation, of a foreign state (or part thereof) under this section the Attorney General, after consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government, shall review the conditions in the foreign state (or part of such foreign state) for which a designation is in effect under this subsection and shall determine whether the conditions for such designation under this subsection continue to be met. The Attorney General shall provide on a timely basis for the publication of notice of each such determination (including the basis for the determination, and, in the case of an affirmative determination, the period of extension of designation under subparagraph (C)) in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Termination of designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Attorney General determines under subparagraph (A) that a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) no longer continues to meet the conditions for designation under paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall terminate the designation by pub<!-- PDFPage:164 -->lishing notice in the Federal Register of the determination under this subparagraph (including the basis for the determination). Such termination is effective in accordance with subsection (d)(3) of this section, but shall not be effective earlier than 60 days after the date the notice is published or, if later, the expiration of the most recent previous extension under subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Extension of designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Attorney General does not determine under subparagraph (A) that a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) no longer meets the conditions for designation under paragraph (1), the period of designation of the foreign state is extended for an additional period of 6 months (or, in the discretion of the Attorney General, a period of 12 or 18 months).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Information concerning protected status at time of designations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At the time of a designation of a foreign state under this subsection, the Attorney General shall make available information respecting the temporary protected status made available to aliens who are nationals of such designated foreign state.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Review</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Designations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">There is no judicial review of any determination of the Attorney General with respect to the designation, or termination or extension of a designation, of a foreign state under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Application to individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General shall establish an administrative procedure for the review of the denial of benefits to aliens under this subsection. Such procedure shall not prevent an alien from asserting protection under this section in deportation proceedings if the alien demonstrates that the alien is a national of a state designated under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Aliens eligible for temporary protected status</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Nationals of designated foreign states</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to paragraph (3), an alien, who is a national of a state designated under subsection (b)(1) of this section (or in the case of an alien having no nationality, is a person who last habitually resided in such designated state), meets the requirements of this paragraph only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the alien has been continuously physically present in the United States since the effective date of the most recent designation of that state;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the alien has continuously resided in the United States since such date as the Attorney General may designate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the alien is admissible as an immigrant, except as otherwise provided under paragraph (2)(A), and is not ineligible for temporary protected status under paragraph (2)(B); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) to the extent and in a manner which the Attorney General establishes, the alien registers for the temporary protected status under this section during a registration period of not less than 180 days.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Registration fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General may require payment of a reasonable fee as a condition of registering an alien under subparagraph (A)(iv) (including providing an alien with an &ldquo;employment authorized&rdquo; endorsement or other appropriate work permit under this section). The amount of any such fee shall not exceed $50. In the case of aliens registered pursuant to a designation under this section made after July 17, 1991, the Attorney General may impose a separate, additional fee for providing an alien with documentation of work authorization. Notwithstanding section 3302 of title 31, all fees collected under this subparagraph shall be credited to the appropriation to be used in carrying out this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligibility standards</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Waiver of certain grounds for inadmissibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the determination of an alien's admissibility for purposes of subparagraph (A)(iii) of paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the provisions of paragraphs (5) and (7)(A) of section 1182(a) of this title shall not apply;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) except as provided in clause (iii), the Attorney General may waive any other provision of section 1182(a) of this title in the case of individual aliens for humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest; but</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) paragraphs (2)(A) and (2)(B) (relating to criminals) of such section,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) paragraph (2)(C) of such section (relating to drug offenses), except for so much of such paragraph as relates to a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) paragraphs (3)(A), (3)(B), (3)(C), and (3)(E) of such section (relating to national security and participation in the Nazi persecutions or those who have engaged in genocide).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Aliens ineligible</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An alien shall not be eligible for temporary protected status under this section if the Attorney General finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the alien has been convicted of any felony or 2 or more misdemeanors committed in the United States, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the alien is described in section 1253(h)(2) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Withdrawal of temporary protected status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall withdraw temporary protected status granted to an alien under this section if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) except as provided in paragraph (4) and permitted in subsection (f)(3) of this section, <!-- PDFPage:165 -->the alien has not remained continuously physically present in the United States from the date the alien first was granted temporary protected status under this section, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the alien fails, without good cause, to register with the Attorney General annually, at the end of each 12-month period after the granting of such status, in a form and manner specified by the Attorney General.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of brief, casual, and innocent departures and certain other absences</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) For purposes of paragraphs (1)(A)(i) and (3)(B), an alien shall not be considered to have failed to maintain continuous physical presence in the United States by virtue of brief, casual, and innocent absences from the United States, without regard to whether such absences were authorized by the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of paragraph (1)(A)(ii), an alien shall not be considered to have failed to maintain continuous residence in the United States by reason of a brief, casual, and innocent absence described in subparagraph (A) or due merely to a brief temporary trip abroad required by emergency or extenuating circumstances outside the control of the alien.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Construction</h4>
