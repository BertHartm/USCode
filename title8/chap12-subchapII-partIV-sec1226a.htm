<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Detention of terrorist aliens</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Custody</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall take into custody any alien who is certified under paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Release</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraphs (5) and (6), the Attorney General shall maintain custody of such an alien until the alien is removed from the United States. Except as provided in paragraph (6), such custody shall be maintained irrespective of any relief from removal for which the alien may be eligible, or any relief from removal granted the alien, until the Attorney General determines that the alien is no longer an alien who may be certified under paragraph (3). If the alien is finally determined not to be removable, detention pursuant to this subsection shall terminate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General may certify an alien under this paragraph if the Attorney General has reasonable grounds to believe that the alien&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall place an alien detained under paragraph (1) in removal proceedings, or shall charge the alien with a criminal offense, not later than 7 days after the commencement of such detention. If the requirement of the preceding sentence is not satisfied, the Attorney General shall release the alien.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Limitation on indefinite detention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An alien detained solely under paragraph (1) who has not been removed under section 1231(a)(1)(A) of this title, and whose removal is unlikely in the reasonably foreseeable future, may be detained for additional periods of up to six months only if the release of the alien will threaten the national security of the United States or the safety of the community or any person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Review of certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall review the certification made under paragraph (3) every 6 months. If the Attorney General determines, in the Attorney General's discretion, that the certification should be revoked, the alien may be released on such conditions as the Attorney General deems appropriate, unless such re<!-- PDFPage:233 -->lease is otherwise prohibited by law. The alien may request each 6 months in writing that the Attorney General reconsider the certification and may submit documents or other evidence in support of that request.</p>
