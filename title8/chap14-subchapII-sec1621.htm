<h4 class="note-head">References in Text</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Immigration and Nationality Act, referred to in subsecs. (a)(2) and (c)(2)(B), is act June 27, 1952, ch. 477, 66 Stat. 163, as amended, which is classified principally to chapter 12 (&sect;1101 et seq.) of this title. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title note set out under section 1101 of this title and Tables.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 1611(c) of this title, referred to in subsec. (c)(3), was in the original &ldquo;section 4001(c)&rdquo;, meaning section 4001(c) of Pub. L. 104&ndash;193, which was translated as reading section 401(c) to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because Pub. L. 104&ndash;193 does not contain a section 4001 and section 401(c) relates to Federal public benefits.</p>
