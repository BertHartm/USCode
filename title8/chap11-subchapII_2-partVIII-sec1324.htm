L. 103&ndash;322, &sect;60024(1)(F), which directed the substitution of &ldquo;shall be punished as provided in subparagraph (B)&rdquo; for &ldquo;shall be fined in accordance with title 18 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both, for each alien in respect to whom any violation of this paragraph occurs&rdquo; in concluding provisions, was executed by making the substitution in text which contained the words &ldquo;United States Code,&rdquo; after &ldquo;title 18,&rdquo;, to reflect the probable intent of Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 103&ndash;322, &sect;60024(1)(A)&ndash;(E), (G), designated existing provisions of par. (1) as subpar. (A) of par. (1), redesignated subpars. (A) to (D) of former par. (1) as cls. (i) to (iv), respectively, of subpar. (A), and added subpar. (B).</p>

<p class="note-body">1988&mdash;Subsec. (a)(1). Pub. L. 100&ndash;525, &sect;2(d)(1), in closing provisions substituted &ldquo;or imprisoned&rdquo; for &ldquo;imprisoned&rdquo; and &ldquo;this paragraph&rdquo; for &ldquo;this subsection&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsec. (b)(4)(C), (5). Pub. L. 100&ndash;525, &sect;2(d)(2), amended Pub. L. 99&ndash;603, &sect;112(b)(5), (8). See 1986 Amendment note below.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) willfully or knowingly conceals, harbors, or shields from detection, or attempts to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection, in any place, including any building or any means of transportation; or</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsec. (b)(2). Pub. L. 99&ndash;603, &sect;112(b)(3), inserted &ldquo;or is being&rdquo; after &ldquo;has been&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsec. (b)(5). Pub. L. 99&ndash;603, &sect;112(b)(7)&ndash;(9), as amended by Pub. L. 100&ndash;525, &sect;2(d)(2)(B), substituted &ldquo;,&nbsp;except that&rdquo; for &ldquo;:&nbsp;<em>Provided</em>, That&rdquo; in provisions preceding subpar.

(B), and substituted &ldquo;had not received prior official authorization to come to, enter, or reside in the United States or that such alien had come to, entered, or remained in the United States in violation of law&rdquo; for &ldquo;was not entitled to enter, or reside within, the United States&rdquo; in subpar. (C).</p>
<p class="note-body">1981&mdash;Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 97&ndash;116 strengthened the seizure and forfeiture authority by striking out the &ldquo;innocent owner&rdquo; exemption and merely requiring the Government to show probable cause that the conveyance seized has been used to illegally transport aliens, which when demonstrated, shifts the burden of proof to the owner or claimant to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the conveyance was not illegally used, by relieving the Government of the obligation to pay any administrative and incidental costs incurred by a successful claimant provided probable cause for the original seizure was demonstrated, and by striking out the requirement that the Government satisfy any valid lien or third party interest in the conveyance without expense to the interest holder by providing the lienholders interest be satisfied only after costs associated with the seizure have been deducted.</p>
<p class="note-body">1978&mdash;Subsecs. (b), (c). Pub. L. 95&ndash;582 added subsec. (b) and redesignated former subsec. (b) as (c).</p>
