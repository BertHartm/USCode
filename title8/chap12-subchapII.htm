<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the proportion of the visa numbers made available under each of paragraphs (1) through (5) of section 1153(b) of this title is equal to the ratio of the total number of visas made available under the respective paragraph to the total number of visas made available under section 1153(b) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Maximum number of admissions; increases for humanitarian concerns; allocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the number of refugees who may be admitted under this section in fiscal year 1980, 1981, or 1982, may not exceed fifty thousand unless the President determines, before the beginning of the fiscal year and after appropriate consultation (as defined in subsection (e) of this section), that admission of a specific number of refugees in excess of such number is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the number of refugees who may be admitted under this section in any fiscal year after fiscal year 1982 shall be such number as the President determines, before the beginning of the fiscal year and after appropriate consultation, is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Admissions under this subsection shall be allocated among refugees of special humanitarian concern to the United States in accordance with a determination made by the President after appropriate consultation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the determination made under this subsection for each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1992), the President shall enumerate, with the respective number of refugees so determined, the number of aliens who were granted asylum in the previous year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For any fiscal year, not more than a total of 1,000 refugees may be admitted under this subsection or granted asylum under section 1158 of this title pursuant to a determination under the third sentence of section 1101(a)(42) of this title (relating to persecution for resistance to coercive population control methods).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determinations by President respecting number of admissions for humanitarian concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the President determines, after appropriate consultation, that (1) an unforeseen emergency refugee situation exists, (2) the admission of certain refugees in response to the emergency refugee situation is justified by grave humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest, and (3) the admission to the United States of these refugees cannot be accomplished under subsection (a) of this section, the President may fix a number of refugees to be admitted to the United States during the succeeding period (not to exceed twelve months) in response to the emergency refugee situation and such admissions shall be allocated among refugees of special humanitarian concern to the United States in accordance with a determination made by the President after the appropriate consultation provided under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Admission by Attorney General of refugees; criteria; admission status of spouse or child; applicability of other statutory requirements; termination of refugee status of alien, spouse or child</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the numerical limitations established pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the Attorney General may, in the Attorney General's discretion and pursuant to such regulations as the Attorney General may prescribe, admit any refugee who is not firmly resettled in any foreign country, is determined to be of special humanitarian concern to the United States, and is admissible (except as otherwise provided under paragraph (3)) as an immigrant under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A spouse or child (as defined in section 1101(b)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) of this title) of any refugee who qualifies for admission under paragraph (1) shall, if not otherwise entitled to admission under paragraph (1) and if not a person described in the second sentence of section <!-- PDFPage:81 -->1101(a)(42) of this title, be entitled to the same admission status as such refugee if accompanying, or following to join, such refugee and if the spouse or child is admissible (except as otherwise provided under paragraph (3)) as an immigrant under this chapter. Upon the spouse's or child's admission to the United States, such admission shall be charged against the numerical limitation established in accordance with the appropriate subsection under which the refugee's admission is charged.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of paragraphs (4), (5), and (7)(A) of section 1182(a) of this title shall not be applicable to any alien seeking admission to the United States under this subsection, and the Attorney General may waive any other provision of such section (other than paragraph (2)(C) or subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (E) of paragraph (3)) with respect to such an alien for humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest. Any such waiver by the Attorney General shall be in writing and shall be granted only on an individual basis following an investigation. The Attorney General shall provide for the annual reporting to Congress of the number of waivers granted under this paragraph in the previous fiscal year and a summary of the reasons for granting such waivers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The refugee status of any alien (and of the spouse or child of the alien) may be terminated by the Attorney General pursuant to such regulations as the Attorney General may prescribe if the Attorney General determines that the alien was not in fact a refugee within the meaning of section 1101(a)(42) of this title at the time of the alien's admission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Oversight reporting and consultation requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Before the start of each fiscal year the President shall report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate regarding the foreseeable number of refugees who will be in need of resettlement during the fiscal year and the anticipated allocation of refugee admissions during the fiscal year. The President shall provide for periodic discussions between designated representatives of the President and members of such committees regarding changes in the worldwide refugee situation, the progress of refugee admissions, and the possible need for adjustments in the allocation of admissions among refugees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As soon as possible after representatives of the President initiate appropriate consultation with respect to the number of refugee admissions under subsection (a) of this section or with respect to the admission of refugees in response to an emergency refugee situation under subsection (b) of this section, the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate shall cause to have printed in the Congressional Record the substance of such consultation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) After the President initiates appropriate consultation prior to making a determination under subsection (a) of this section, a hearing to review the proposed determination shall be held unless public disclosure of the details of the proposal would jeopardize the lives or safety of individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) After the President initiates appropriate consultation prior to making a determination, under subsection (b) of this section, that the number of refugee admissions should be increased because of an unforeseen emergency refugee situation, to the extent that time and the nature of the emergency refugee situation permit, a hearing to review the proposal to increase refugee admissions shall be held unless public disclosure of the details of the proposal would jeopardize the lives or safety of individuals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Appropriate consultation&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;appropriate consultation&rdquo; means, with respect to the admission of refugees and allocation of refugee admissions, discussions in person by designated Cabinet-level representatives of the President with members of the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and of the House of Representatives to review the refugee situation or emergency refugee situation, to project the extent of possible participation of the United States therein, to discuss the reasons for believing that the proposed admission of refugees is justified by humanitarian concerns or grave humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest, and to provide such members with the following information:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A description of the nature of the refugee situation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A description of the number and allocation of the refugees to be admitted and an analysis of conditions within the countries from which they came.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A description of the proposed plans for their movement and resettlement and the estimated cost of their movement and resettlement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) An analysis of the anticipated social, economic, and demographic impact of their admission to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) A description of the extent to which other countries will admit and assist in the resettlement of such refugees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) An analysis of the impact of the participation of the United States in the resettlement of such refugees on the foreign policy interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Such additional information as may be appropriate or requested by such members.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">To the extent possible, information described in this subsection shall be provided at least two weeks in advance of discussions in person by designated representatives of the President with such members.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Lawful residence</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall adjust the status of an alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence if the Attorney General determines that the alien meets the following requirements:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Application period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The alien must apply for such adjustment during the 18-month period beginning on the first day of the seventh month that begins after November 6, 1986.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Performance of seasonal agricultural services and residence in the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The alien must establish that he has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) resided in the United States, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) performed seasonal agricultural services in the United States for at least 90 man-days,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">during the 12-month period ending on May 1, 1986. For purposes of the previous sentence, performance of seasonal agricultural services in the United States for more than one employer on any one day shall be counted as performance of services for only 1 man-day.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Admissible as immigrant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The alien must establish that he is admissible to the United States as an immigrant, except as otherwise provided under subsection (c)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustment to permanent residence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall adjust the status of any alien provided lawful temporary resident status under paragraph (1) to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence on the following date:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Group 1</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the numerical limitation established under subparagraph (C), in the case of an alien who has established, at the time of application for temporary residence under paragraph (1), that the alien performed seasonal agricultural services in the United States for at least 90 man-days during each of the 12-month periods ending on May 1, 1984, 1985, and 1986, the adjustment shall occur on the first day after the end of the one-year period that begins on the later of (I) the date the alien was granted such temporary resident status, or (II) the day after the last day of the application period described in paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Group 2</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of aliens to which subparagraph (A) does not apply, the adjustment shall occur on the day after the last day of the two-year period that begins on the later of (I) the date the alien was granted such temporary resident status, or (II) the day after the last day of the application period described in paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Numerical limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to more than 350,000 aliens. If more than 350,000 aliens meet the requirements of such subparagraph, such subparagraph shall apply to the 350,000 aliens whose applications for adjustment were first filed under paragraph (1) and subparagraph (B) shall apply to the remaining aliens.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Termination of temporary residence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) During the period of temporary resident status granted an alien under paragraph (1), the Attorney General may terminate such status only upon a determination under this chapter that the alien is deportable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Before any alien becomes eligible for adjustment of status under paragraph (2), the Attorney General may deny adjustment to permanent status and provide for termination of the temporary resident status granted such alien under paragraph (1) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the Attorney General finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the adjustment to temporary resident status was the result of fraud or willful misrepresentation as set out in section 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the alien commits an act that (I) makes the alien inadmissible to the United States as an immigrant, except as provided under subsection (c)(2) of this section, or (II) is convicted of a felony or 3 or more misdemeanors committed in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Authorized travel and employment during temporary residence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the period an alien is in lawful temporary resident status granted under this subsection, the alien has the right to travel abroad (including commutation from a residence abroad) and shall be granted authorization to engage in employment in the United States and shall be provided an &ldquo;employment authorized&rdquo; endorsement or other appropriate work permit, in the same manner as for aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, an alien who acquires the status of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence under paragraph (1), such status not having changed, is considered to be an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence (as described in section 1101(a)(20) of this title), other than under any provision of the immigration laws.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Applications for adjustment of status</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) To whom may be made</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Within the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General shall provide that applications for adjustment of status under subsection (a) may be filed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) with the Attorney General, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) with a designated entity (designated under paragraph (2)), but only if the applicant consents to the forwarding of the application to the Attorney General.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Outside the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General, in cooperation with the Secretary of State, shall provide a procedure whereby an alien may apply for adjustment of status under subsection (a)(1) of this <!-- PDFPage:89 -->section at an appropriate consular office outside the United States. If the alien otherwise qualifies for such adjustment, the Attorney General shall provide such documentation of authorization to enter the United States and to have the alien's status adjusted upon entry as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Designation of entities to receive applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of receiving applications under this section, the Attorney General&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall designate qualified voluntary organizations and other qualified State, local, community, farm labor organizations, and associations of agricultural employers, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may designate such other persons as the Attorney General determines are qualified and have substantial experience, demonstrated competence, and traditional long-term involvement in the preparation and submittal of applications for adjustment of status under section 1159 or 1255 of this title, Public Law 89&ndash;732 [8 U.S.C. 1255 note], or Public Law 95&ndash;145 [8 U.S.C. 1255 note].</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Proof of eligibility</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An alien may establish that he meets the requirement of subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section through government employment records, records supplied by employers or collective bargaining organizations, and such other reliable documentation as the alien may provide. The Attorney General shall establish special procedures to credit properly work in cases in which an alien was employed under an assumed name.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Documentation of work history</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) An alien applying for adjustment of status under subsection (a)(1) of this section has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the alien has worked the requisite number of man-days (as required under subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) If an employer or farm labor contractor employing such an alien has kept proper and adequate records respecting such employment, the alien's burden of proof under clause (i) may be met by securing timely production of those records under regulations to be promulgated by the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) An alien can meet such burden of proof if the alien establishes that the alien has in fact performed the work described in subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section by producing sufficient evidence to show the extent of that employment as a matter of just and reasonable inference. In such a case, the burden then shifts to the Attorney General to disprove the alien's evidence with a showing which negates the reasonableness of the inference to be drawn from the evidence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of applications by designated entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each designated entity must agree to forward to the Attorney General applications filed with it in accordance with paragraph (1)(A)(ii) but not to forward to the Attorney General applications filed with it unless the applicant has consented to such forwarding. No such entity may make a determination required by this section to be made by the Attorney General.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Limitation on access to information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Files and records prepared for purposes of this section by designated entities operating under this section are confidential and the Attorney General and the Service shall not have access to such files or records relating to an alien without the consent of the alien, except as allowed by a court order issued pursuant to paragraph (6) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Confidentiality of information</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in this paragraph, neither the Attorney General, nor any other official or employee of the Department of Justice, or bureau or agency thereof, may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) use the information furnished by the applicant pursuant to an application filed under this section for any purpose other than to make a determination on the application, including a determination under subsection (a)(3)(B) of this section, or for enforcement of paragraph (7);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) make any publication whereby the information furnished by any particular individual can be identified; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) permit anyone other than the sworn officers and employees of the Department or bureau or agency or, with respect to applications filed with a designated entity, that designated entity, to examine individual applications.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Required disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General shall provide information furnished under this section, and any other information derived from such furnished information, to a duly recognized law enforcement entity in connection with a criminal investigation or prosecution, when such information is requested in writing by such entity, or to an official coroner for purposes of affirmatively identifying a deceased individual (whether or not such individual is deceased as a result of a crime).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Construction</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the use, or release, for immigration enforcement purposes or law enforcement purposes of information contained in files or records of the Service pertaining to an application filed under this section, other than information furnished by an applicant pursuant to the application, or any other information derived from the application, that is not available from any other source.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Criminal convictions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Information concerning whether the applicant has at any time been convicted of a crime may be used or released for immi<!-- PDFPage:90 -->gration enforcement or law enforcement purposes.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Whoever&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) files an application for adjustment of status under this section and knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up a material fact or makes any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) creates or supplies a false writing or document for use in making such an application,</p>

Whenever the Attorney General finds that a commercial airline has failed to comply with regulations of the Attorney General relating to requirements of airlines for the detection of fraudulent documents used by passengers traveling to the United States (including the training of personnel in such detection), the Attorney General may suspend the entry of some or all aliens transported to the United States by such airline.</p>

No court shall have jurisdiction to review a decision of the Attorney General to grant or deny a waiver under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Admission of immigrant inadmissible for fraud or willful misrepresentation of material fact</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Attorney General may, in the discretion of the Attorney General, waive the application of clause (i) of subsection (a)(6)(C) of this section in the case of an immigrant who is the spouse, son, or daughter of a United States citizen or of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if it is established to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the refusal of admission to the United States of such immigrant alien would result in extreme hardship to the citizen or lawfully resident spouse or parent of such an alien.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Before making such agreement, the accredited school has been satisfied that the alien (i) is a graduate of a school of medicine which is accredited by a body or bodies approved for the purpose by the Secretary of Education (regardless of whether such school of medicine is in the United States); or (ii)(I) has passed parts I and II of the National Board of Medical Examiners Examination (or an equivalent examination as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services), (II) has competency in oral and written English, (III) will be able to adapt to the educational and cultural environment in which he will be receiving his education or training, and (IV) has adequate prior education and training to participate satisfactorily in the program for which he is coming to the United States.

<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Requirements for admission of nonimmigrant nurses during five-year period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The qualifications referred to in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) of this title, with respect to an alien who is coming to the United States to perform nursing services for a facility, are that the alien&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has obtained a full and unrestricted license to practice professional nursing in the country where the alien obtained nursing education or has received nursing education in the United States or Canada;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) has passed an appropriate examination (recognized in regulations promulgated in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services) or has a full and unrestricted license under State law to practice professional nursing in the State of intended employment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is fully qualified and eligible under the laws (including such temporary or interim licensing requirements which authorize the nurse to be employed) governing the place of intended employment to engage in the practice of professional nursing as a registered nurse immediately upon admission to the United States and is authorized under such laws to be employed by the facility.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The attestation referred to in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) of this title is an attestation as to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) There would be a substantial disruption through no fault of the facility in the delivery of health care services of the facility without the services of such an alien or aliens.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The employment of the alien will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of registered nurses similarly employed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The alien employed by the facility will be paid the wage rate for registered nurses similarly employed by the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Either (I) the facility has taken and is taking timely and significant steps designed to recruit and retain sufficient registered nurses who are United States citizens or immigrants who are authorized to perform nursing services, in order to remove as quickly as reasonably possible the dependence of the facility on nonimmigrant registered nurses, or (II) the facility is subject to an approved State plan for the recruitment and retention of nurses (described in paragraph (3)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute, and the employment of such an alien is not intended or designed to influence an election for a bargaining representative for registered nurses of the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) At the time of the filing of the petition for registered nurses under section <!-- PDFPage:106 -->1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) of this title, notice of the filing has been provided by the facility to the bargaining representative of the registered nurses at the facility or, where there is no such bargaining representative, notice of the filing has been provided to registered nurses employed at the facility through posting in conspicuous locations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A facility is considered not to meet clause (i) (relating to an attestation of a substantial disruption in delivery of health care services) if the facility, within the previous year, laid off registered nurses. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, a facility that lays off a registered nurse other than a staff nurse still meets clause (i) if, in its attestation under this subparagraph, the facility has attested that it will not replace the nurse with a nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) of this title (either through promotion or otherwise) for a period of 1 year after the date of the lay off. Nothing in clause (iv) shall be construed as requiring a facility to have taken significant steps described in such clause before Dec. 18, 1989. In the case of an alien for whom an employer has filed an attestation under this subparagraph and who is performing services at a worksite other than the employer's or other than a worksite controlled by the employer, the Secretary may waive such requirements for the attestation for the worksite as may be appropriate in order to avoid duplicative attestations, in cases of temporary, emergency circumstances, with respect to information not within the knowledge of the attestor, or for other good cause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(iv)(I), each of the following shall be considered a significant step reasonably designed to recruit and retain registered nurses:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Operating a training program for registered nurses at the facility or financing (or providing participation in) a training program for registered nurses elsewhere.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Providing career development programs and other methods of facilitating health care workers to become registered nurses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Paying registered nurses wages at a rate higher than currently being paid to registered nurses similarly employed in the geographic area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Providing adequate support services to free registered nurses from administrative and other nonnursing duties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) Providing reasonable opportunities for meaningful salary advancement by registered nurses.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The steps described in this subparagraph shall not be considered to be an exclusive list of the significant steps that may be taken to meet the conditions of subparagraph (A)(iv)(I). Nothing herein shall require a facility to take more than one step, if the facility can demonstrate that taking a second step is not reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Subject to subparagraph (E), an attestation under subparagraph (A) shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) apply to petitions filed during such 1-year period if the facility states in each such petition that it continues to comply with the conditions in the attestation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) A facility may meet the requirements under this paragraph with respect to more than one registered nurse in a single petition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall compile and make available for public examination in a timely manner in Washington, D.C., a list identifying facilities which have filed petitions for nonimmigrants under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) of this title and, for each such facility, a copy of the facility's attestation under subparagraph (A) (and accompanying documentation) and each such petition filed by the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process for the receipt, investigation, and disposition of complaints respecting a facility's failure to meet conditions attested to or a facility's misrepresentation of a material fact in an attestation. Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or organization (including bargaining representatives, associations deemed appropriate by the Secretary, and other aggrieved parties as determined under regulations of the Secretary). The Secretary shall conduct an investigation under this clause if there is reasonable cause to believe that a facility fails to meet conditions attested to.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Under such process, the Secretary shall provide, within 180 days after the date such a complaint is filed, for a determination as to whether or not a basis exists to make a finding described in clause (iv). If the Secretary determines that such a basis exists, the Secretary shall provide for notice of such determination to the interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing on the complaint within 60 days of the date of the determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that a facility (for which an attestation is made) has failed to meet a condition attested to or that there was a misrepresentation of material fact in the attestation, the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to be appropriate. Upon receipt of such notice, the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed with respect to a facility during a period of at least 1 year for nurses to be employed by the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) In addition to the sanctions provided under clause (iv), if the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, that a facility has violated the condition attested to under subparagraph (A)(iii) (relating to payment of registered nurses at the prevailing wage rate), the Secretary shall order the facility to provide for payment of such amounts of back pay as may be required to comply with such condition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Labor shall provide for a process under which a State may submit to the Secretary a plan for the recruitment and retention of United States citizens and immigrants who are authorized to perform nursing services as registered nurses in facilities in the State. Such a plan may include counseling and educating health workers and other individuals con<!-- PDFPage:107 -->cerning the employment opportunities available to registered nurses. The Secretary shall provide, on an annual basis in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, for the approval or disapproval of such a plan, for purposes of paragraph (2)(A)(iv)(II). Such a plan may not be considered to be approved with respect to the facility unless the plan provides for the taking of significant steps described in paragraph (2)(A)(iv)(I) with respect to registered nurses in the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The period of admission of an alien under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) of this title shall be for an initial period of not to exceed 3 years, subject to an extension for a period or periods, not to exceed a total period of admission of 5 years (or a total period of admission of 6 years in the case of extraordinary circumstances, as determined by the Attorney General).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For purposes of this subsection and section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) of this title, the term &ldquo;facility&rdquo; includes an employer who employs registered nurses in a home setting.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Labor condition application</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) will provide working conditions for such a nonimmigrant that will not adversely affect the working conditions of workers similarly employed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute in the occupational classification at the place of employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The employer, at the time of filing the application&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) has provided notice of the filing under this paragraph to the bargaining representative (if any) of the employer's employees in the occupational classification and area for which aliens are sought, or</p>

Such list shall include the wage rate, number of aliens sought, period of intended employment, and date of need. The Secretary shall make such list available for public examination in Washington, D.C. The Secretary of Labor shall review such an application only for completeness and obvious inaccuracies. Unless the Secretary finds that the application is incomplete or obviously inaccurate, the Secretary shall provide the certification described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this title within 7 days of the date of the filing of the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary shall establish a process for the receipt, investigation, and disposition of complaints respecting a petitioner's failure to meet a condition specified in an application submitted under paragraph (1) or a petitioner's misrepresentation of material facts in such an application. Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or organization (including bargaining representatives). No investigation or hearing shall be conducted on a complaint concerning such a failure or misrepresentation unless the complaint was filed not later than 12 months after the date of the failure or misrepresentation, respectively.

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Under such process, the Secretary shall provide, within 30 days after the date such a complaint is filed, for a determination as to whether or not a reasonable basis exists to make a finding described in subparagraph (C). If the Secretary determines that such a reasonable basis exists, the Secretary shall provide for notice of such determination to the interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing on the complaint, in accordance with section 556 of title 5, within 60 days after the date of the determination.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Provision of information to save system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General shall ensure that appropriate information regarding the application of this paragraph is provided to the system for alien verification of eligibility (SAVE) described in section 1137(d)(3) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1320b&ndash;7(d)(3)].</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The admission to the United States of any alien as a nonimmigrant shall be for such time and under such conditions as the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe, including when he deems necessary the giving of a bond with sufficient surety in such sum and containing such conditions as the Attorney General shall prescribe, to insure that at the expiration of such time or upon failure to maintain the status under which he was admitted, or to maintain any status subsequently acquired under section 1258 of this title, such alien will depart from the United States. No alien admitted to Guam without a visa pursuant to section 1182(<em>l</em>) of this title may be authorized to enter or stay in the United States other than in Guam or to remain in Guam for a period exceeding fifteen days from date of admission to Guam. No alien admitted to the United States without a visa pursuant to section 1187 of this title may be authorized to remain in the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor for a period exceeding 90 days from the date of admission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The period of authorized status as a nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(O) of this title shall be for such period as the Attorney General may specify in order to provide for the event (or events) for which the nonimmigrant is admitted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The period of authorized status as a nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(P) of this title shall be for such period as the Attorney General may specify in order to provide for the competition, event, or performance for which the nonimmigrant is admitted. In the case of nonimmigrants admitted as individual athletes under section 1101(a)(15)(P) of this title, the period of authorized status may be for an initial period (not to exceed 5 years) during which the nonimmigrant will perform as an athlete and such period may be extended by the Attorney General for an additional period of up to 5 years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Presumption of status; written waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every alien (other than a nonimmigrant described in subparagraph (H)(i) or (L) of section 1101(a)(15) of this title) shall be presumed to be an immigrant until he establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer, at the time of application for a visa, and the immigration officers, at the time of application for admission, that he is entitled to a nonimmigrant status under section 1101(a)(15) of this title. An alien who is an officer or employee of any foreign government or of any international organization entitled to enjoy privileges, exemptions, and immunities under the International Organizations Immunities Act [22 U.S.C. 288 et seq.], or an alien who is the attendant, servant, employee, or member of the immediate family of any such alien shall not be entitled to apply for or receive an immigrant visa, or to enter the United States as an immigrant unless he executes a written waiver in the same form and substance as is prescribed by section 1257(b) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The question of importing any alien as a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H), (L), (O), or (P)(i) of this title in any specific case or specific cases shall be determined by the Attorney General, after consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government, upon petition of the importing employer. Such petition, shall be made and approved before the visa is granted. The petition shall be in such form and contain such information as the Attorney General shall prescribe. The approval of such a petition shall <!-- PDFPage:127 -->not, of itself, be construed as establishing that the alien is a nonimmigrant. For purposes of this subsection with respect to nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of this title, the term &ldquo;appropriate agencies of Government&rdquo; means the Department of Labor and includes the Department of Agriculture. The provisions of section 1188 of this title shall apply to the question of importing any alien as a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Attorney General shall provide for a procedure under which an importing employer which meets requirements established by the Attorney General may file a blanket petition to import aliens as nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title instead of filing individual petitions under paragraph (1) to import such aliens. Such procedure shall permit the expedited processing of visas for admission of aliens covered under such a petition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title, an alien is considered to be serving in a capacity involving specialized knowledge with respect to a company if the alien has a special knowledge of the company product and its application in international markets or has an advanced level of knowledge of processes and procedures of the company.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Attorney General shall provide a process for reviewing and acting upon petitions under this subsection with respect to nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title within 30 days after the date a completed petition has been filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The period of authorized admission for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a nonimmigrant admitted to render services in a managerial or executive capacity under section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title shall not exceed 7 years, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a nonimmigrant admitted to render services in a capacity that involves specialized knowledge under section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title shall not exceed 5 years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Attorney General shall approve a petition&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) with respect to a nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(O)(i) of this title only after consultation in accordance with paragraph (6) or, with respect to aliens seeking entry for a motion picture or television production, after consultation with the appropriate union representing the alien's occupational peers and a management organization in the area of the alien's ability, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to a nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(O)(ii) of this title after consultation in accordance with paragraph (6) or, in the case of such an alien seeking entry for a motion picture or television production, after consultation with such a labor organization and a management organization in the area of the alien's ability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of an alien seeking entry for a motion picture or television production, (i) any opinion under the previous sentence shall only be advisory, (ii) any such opinion that recommends denial must be in writing, (iii) in making the decision the Attorney General shall consider the exigencies and scheduling of the production, and (iv) the Attorney General shall append to the decision any such opinion. The Attorney General shall provide by regulation for the waiver of the consultation requirement under subparagraph (A) in the case of aliens who have been admitted as nonimmigrants under section 1101(a)(15)(O)(i) of this title because of extraordinary ability in the arts and who seek readmission to perform similar services within 2 years after the date of a consultation under such subparagraph. Not later than 5 days after the date such a waiver is provided, the Attorney General shall forward a copy of the petition and all supporting documentation to the national office of an appropriate labor organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) For purposes of section 1101(a)(15)(P)(i)(a) of this title, an alien is described in this subparagraph if the alien&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conditions for approval of H&ndash;2A petitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A petition to import an alien as an H&ndash;2A worker (as defined in subsection (i)(2) of this section) may not be approved by the Attorney General unless the petitioner has applied to the Secretary of Labor for a certification that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there are not sufficient workers who are able, willing, and qualified, and who will be available at the time and place needed, to perform the labor or services involved in the petition, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the employment of the alien in such labor or services will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Labor may require by regulation, as a condition of issuing the certification, the payment of a fee to recover the reasonable costs of processing applications for certification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions for denial of labor certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Labor may not issue a certification under subsection (a) of this section with respect to an employer if the conditions described in that subsection are not met or if any of the following conditions are met:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) There is a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute which, under the regulations, precludes such certification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) The employer during the previous two-year period employed H&ndash;2A workers and the Secretary of Labor has determined, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that the employer at any time during that period substantially violated a material term or condition of the labor certification with respect to the employment of domestic or nonimmigrant workers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) No employer may be denied certification under subparagraph (A) for more than three years for any violation described in such subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The employer has not provided the Secretary with satisfactory assurances that if the employment for which the certification is sought is not covered by State workers&rsquo; compensation law, the employer will provide, at no cost to the worker, insurance covering injury and disease arising out of and in the course of the worker's employment which will provide benefits at least equal to those provided under the State workers&rsquo; compensation law for comparable employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Secretary determines that the employer has not made positive recruitment efforts within a multi-state region of traditional or expected labor supply where the Secretary finds that there are a significant number of qualified United States workers who, if recruited, would be willing to make themselves available for work at the time and place needed. Positive recruitment under this paragraph is in addition to, and shall be conducted within the same time period as, the circulation through the interstate employment service system of the employer's job offer. The obligation to engage in positive recruitment under this paragraph shall terminate on the date the H&ndash;2A workers depart for the employer's place of employment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rules for consideration of applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The following rules shall apply in the case of the filing and consideration of an application for a labor certification under this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Deadline for filing applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of Labor may not require that the application be filed more than 60 days before the first date the employer requires the labor or services of the H&ndash;2A worker.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice within seven days of deficiencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The employer shall be notified in writing within seven days of the date of filing if the application does not meet the standards (other than that described in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section) for approval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the application does not meet such standards, the notice shall include the reasons therefor and the Secretary shall provide an opportunity for the prompt resubmission of a modified application.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Issuance of certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary of Labor shall make, not later than 20 days before the date such labor or services are first required to be performed, the certification described in subsection (a)(1) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the employer has complied with the criteria for certification (including criteria for the recruitment of eligible individuals as prescribed by the Secretary), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the employer does not actually have, or has not been provided with referrals of, qualified eligible individuals who have indicated their availability to perform such labor or services on the terms and conditions of a job offer which meets the requirements of the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In considering the question of whether a specific qualification is appropriate in a job offer, the Secretary shall apply the normal and accepted qualifications required by non-H&ndash;2A-employers in the same or comparable occupations and crops.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) For a period of 3 years subsequent to the effective date of this section, labor certifications shall remain effective only if, from the time the foreign worker departs for the employer's place of employment, the employer will provide employment to any qualified United States worker who applies to the employer until 50 percent of the period of the work contract, under which the foreign worker who is in the job was hired, has elapsed. In ad<!-- PDFPage:146 -->dition, the employer will offer to provide benefits, wages and working conditions required pursuant to this section and regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The requirement of clause (i) shall not apply to any employer who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) did not, during any calendar quarter during the preceding calendar year, use more than 500 man-days of agricultural labor, as defined in section 203(u) of title 29,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) is not a member of an association which has petitioned for certification under this section for its members, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) has not otherwise associated with other employers who are petitioning for temporary foreign workers under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Six months before the end of the 3-year period described in clause (i), the Secretary of Labor shall consider the findings of the report mandated by section 403(a)(4)(D) of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 as well as other relevant materials, including evidence of benefits to United States workers and costs to employers, addressing the advisability of continuing a policy which requires an employer, as a condition for certification under this section, to continue to accept qualified, eligible United States workers for employment after the date the H&ndash;2A workers depart for work with the employer. The Secretary's review of such findings and materials shall lead to the issuance of findings in furtherance of the Congressional policy that aliens not be admitted under this section unless there are not sufficient workers in the United States who are able, willing, and qualified to perform the labor or service needed and that the employment of the aliens in such labor or services will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed. In the absence of the enactment of Federal legislation prior to three months before the end of the 3-year period described in clause (i) which addresses the subject matter of this subparagraph, the Secretary shall immediately publish the findings required by this clause, and shall promulgate, on an interim or final basis, regulations based on his findings which shall be effective no later than three years from the effective date of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) In complying with clause (i) of this subparagraph, an association shall be allowed to refer or transfer workers among its members: <em>Provided</em>, That for purposes of this section an association acting as an agent for its members shall not be considered a joint employer merely because of such referral or transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) United States workers referred or transferred pursuant to clause (iv) of this subparagraph shall not be treated disparately.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) An employer shall not be liable for payments under section 655.202(b)(6) of title 20, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation) with respect to an H&ndash;2A worker who is displaced due to compliance with the requirement of this subparagraph, if the Secretary of Labor certifies that the H&ndash;2A worker was displaced because of the employer's compliance with clause (i) of this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii)(I) No person or entity shall willfully and knowingly withhold domestic workers prior to the arrival of H&ndash;2A workers in order to force the hiring of domestic workers under clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) Upon the receipt of a complaint by an employer that a violation of subclause (I) has occurred the Secretary shall immediately investigate. He shall within 36 hours of the receipt of the complaint issue findings concerning the alleged violation. Where the Secretary finds that a violation has occurred, he shall immediately suspend the application of clause (i) of this subparagraph with respect to that certification for that date of need.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Employers shall furnish housing in accordance with regulations. The employer shall be permitted at the employer's option to provide housing meeting applicable Federal standards for temporary labor camps or to secure housing which meets the local standards for rental and/or public accommodations or other substantially similar class of habitation: <em>Provided</em>, That in the absence of applicable local standards, State standards for rental and/or public accommodations or other substantially similar class of habitation shall be met: <em>Provided further</em>, That in the absence of applicable local or State standards, Federal temporary labor camp standards shall apply: <em>Provided further</em>, That the Secretary of Labor shall issue regulations which address the specific requirements of housing for employees principally engaged in the range production of livestock: <em>Provided further</em>, That when it is the prevailing practice in the area and occupation of intended employment to provide family housing, family housing shall be provided to workers with families who request it: <em>And provided further</em>, That nothing in this paragraph shall require an employer to provide or secure housing for workers who are not entitled to it under the temporary labor certification regulations in effect on June 1, 1986.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Roles of agricultural associations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Permitting filing by agricultural associations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A petition to import an alien as a temporary agricultural worker, and an application for a labor certification with respect to such a worker, may be filed by an association of agricultural producers which use agricultural services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of associations acting as employers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an association is a joint or sole employer of temporary agricultural workers, the certifications granted under this section to the association may be used for the certified job opportunities of any of its producer members and such workers may be transferred among its producer members to perform agricultural services of a temporary or seasonal nature for which the certifications were granted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of violations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Member's violation does not necessarily disqualify association or other members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an individual producer member of a joint employer association is determined to <!-- PDFPage:147 -->have committed an act that under subsection (b)(2) of this section results in the denial of certification with respect to the member, the denial shall apply only to that member of the association unless the Secretary determines that the association or other member participated in, had knowledge of, or reason to know of, the violation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Association's violation does not necessarily disqualify members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) If an association representing agricultural producers as a joint employer is determined to have committed an act that under subsection (b)(2) of this section results in the denial of certification with respect to the association, the denial shall apply only to the association and does not apply to any individual producer member of the association unless the Secretary determines that the member participated in, had knowledge of, or reason to know of, the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) If an association of agricultural producers certified as a sole employer is determined to have committed an act that under subsection (b)(2) of this section results in the denial of certification with respect to the association, no individual producer member of such association may be the beneficiary of the services of temporary alien agricultural workers admitted under this section in the commodity and occupation in which such aliens were employed by the association which was denied certification during the period such denial is in force, unless such producer member employs such aliens in the commodity and occupation in question directly or through an association which is a joint employer of such workers with the producer member.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Expedited administrative appeals of certain determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Regulations shall provide for an expedited procedure for the review of a denial of certification under subsection (a)(1) of this section or a revocation of such a certification or, at the applicant's request, for a de novo administrative hearing respecting the denial or revocation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Labor shall expeditiously, but in no case later than 72 hours after the time a new determination is requested, make a new determination on the request for certification in the case of an H&ndash;2A worker if able, willing, and qualified eligible individuals are not actually available at the time such labor or services are required and a certification was denied in whole or in part because of the availability of qualified workers. If the employer asserts that any eligible individual who has been referred is not able, willing, or qualified, the burden of proof is on the employer to establish that the individual referred is not able, willing, or qualified because of employment-related reasons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Violators disqualified for 5 years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An alien may not be admitted to the United States as a temporary agricultural worker if the alien was admitted to the United States as such a worker within the previous five-year period and the alien during that period violated a term or condition of such previous admission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year, beginning with fiscal year 1987, $10,000,000 for the purposes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) of recruiting domestic workers for temporary labor and services which might otherwise be performed by nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) of monitoring terms and conditions under which such nonimmigrants (and domestic workers employed by the same employers) are employed in the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Labor is authorized to take such actions, including imposing appropriate penalties and seeking appropriate injunctive relief and specific performance of contractual obligations, as may be necessary to assure employer compliance with terms and conditions of employment under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) There are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year, beginning with fiscal year 1987, such sums as may be necessary for the purpose of enabling the Secretary of Labor to make determinations and certifications under this section and under section 1182(a)(5)(A)(i) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) There are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year, beginning with fiscal year 1987, such sums as may be necessary for the purposes of enabling the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out the Secretary's duties and responsibilities under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Miscellaneous provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Attorney General shall provide for such endorsement of entry and exit documents of nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii) of this title as may be necessary to carry out this section and to provide notice for purposes of section 1324a of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of section 1184 of this title and the provisions of this section preempt any State or local law regulating admissibility of nonimmigrant workers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;eligible individual&rdquo; means, with respect to employment, an individual who is not an unauthorized alien (as defined in section 1324a(h)(3) of this title) with respect to that employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;H&ndash;2A worker&rdquo; means a nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Immigrants; nonimmigrants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under the conditions hereinafter prescribed and subject to the limitations prescribed in this chapter or regulations issued thereunder, a consular officer may issue (1) to an immigrant who has made proper application therefor, an immigrant visa which shall consist of the application provided for in section 1202 of this title, visaed by such consular officer, and shall specify the foreign state, if any, to which the immigrant is charged, the immigrant's particular status under such foreign state, the preference, immediate relative, or special immigrant classification to which the alien is charged, the date on which the validity of the visa shall expire, and such additional information as may be required; and (2) to a nonimmigrant who has made proper application therefor, a nonimmigrant visa, which shall specify the classification under section 1101(a)(15) of this title of the nonimmigrant, the period during which the nonimmigrant visa shall be valid, and such additional information as may be required.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Registration; photographs; waiver of requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each alien who applies for a visa shall be registered in connection with his application, and shall furnish copies of his photograph signed by him for such use as may be by regulations required. The requirements of this subsection may be waived in the discretion of the Secretary of State in the case of any alien who is within that class of nonimmigrants enumerated in sections 1101(a)(15)(A), and 1101(a)(15)(G) of this title, or in the case of any alien who is granted a diplomatic visa on a diplomatic passport or on the equivalent thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Period of validity; requirement of visa</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An immigrant visa shall be valid for such period, not exceeding six months, as shall be by regulations prescribed, except that any visa issued to a child lawfully adopted by a United States citizen and spouse while such citizen is serving abroad in the United States Armed Forces, or is employed abroad by the United States Government, or is temporarily abroad on business, shall be valid until such time, for a period not to exceed three years, as the adoptive citizen parent returns to the United States in due course of his service, employment, or business. A nonimmigrant visa shall be valid for such periods as shall be by regulations prescribed. In prescribing the period of validity of a nonimmigrant visa in the case of nationals of any foreign country who are eligible for such visas, the Secretary of State shall, insofar as practicable, accord to such nationals the same treatment upon a reciprocal basis as such foreign country accords to nationals of the United States who are within a similar class; except that in the case of aliens who are nationals of a foreign country and who either are granted refugee status and firmly resettled in another foreign country or are granted permanent residence and residing in another foreign country, the Secretary of State may prescribe the period of validity of such a visa based upon the treatment granted by that other foreign country to alien refugees and permanent residents, respectively, in the United States. An immigrant visa may be replaced under the original number during the fiscal year in which the original visa was issued for an immigrant who establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer that he was unable to use the original immigrant visa during the period of its validity because of reasons beyond his control and for which he was not responsible: <em>Provided</em>, That the immigrant is found by the consular officer to be eligible for an immigrant visa and the immigrant pays again the statutory fees for an application and an immigrant visa.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:151 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Physical examination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Prior to the issuance of an immigrant visa to any alien, the consular officer shall require such alien to submit to a physical and mental examination in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed. Prior to the issuance of a nonimmigrant visa to any alien, the consular officer may require such alien to submit to a physical or mental examination, or both, if in his opinion such examination is necessary to ascertain whether such alien is eligible to receive a visa.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Surrender of visa</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each immigrant shall surrender his immigrant visa to the immigration officer at the port of entry, who shall endorse on the visa the date and the port of arrival, the identity of the vessel or other means of transportation by which the immigrant arrived, and such other endorsements as may be by regulations required.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Surrender of documents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each nonimmigrant shall present or surrender to the immigration officer at the port of entry such documents as may be by regulation required. In the case of an alien crewman not in possession of any individual documents other than a passport and until such time as it becomes practicable to issue individual documents, such alien crewman may be admitted, subject to the provisions of this part, if his name appears in the crew list of the vessel or aircraft on which he arrives and the crew list is visaed by a consular officer, but the consular officer shall have the right to deny admission to any alien crewman from the crew list visa.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Nonissuance of visas or other documents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No visa or other documentation shall be issued to an alien if (1) it appears to the consular officer, from statements in the application, or in the papers submitted therewith, that such alien is ineligible to receive a visa or such other documentation under section 1182 of this title, or any other provision of law, (2) the application fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter, or the regulations issued thereunder, or (3) the consular officer knows or has reason to believe that such alien is ineligible to receive a visa or such other documentation under section 1182 of this title, or any other provision of law: <em>Provided</em>, That a visa or other documentation may be issued to an alien who is within the purview of section 1182(a)(4) of this title, if such alien is otherwise entitled to receive a visa or other documentation, upon receipt of notice by the consular officer from the Attorney General of the giving of a bond or undertaking providing indemnity as in the case of aliens admitted under section 1183 of this title: <em>Provided further</em>, That a visa may be issued to an alien defined in section 1101(a)(15)(B) or (F) of this title, if such alien is otherwise entitled to receive a visa, upon receipt of a notice by the consular officer from the Attorney General of the giving of a bond with sufficient surety in such sum and containing such conditions as the consular officer shall prescribe, to insure that at the expiration of the time for which such alien has been admitted by the Attorney General, as provided in section 1184(a) of this title, or upon failure to maintain the status under which he was admitted, or to maintain any status subsequently acquired under section 1258 of this title, such alien will depart from the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Nonadmission upon arrival</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to entitle any alien, to whom a visa or other documentation has been issued, to be admitted&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1201_1_target" name="1201_1">1</a></sup> the United States, if, upon arrival at a port of entry in the United States, he is found to be inadmissible under this chapter, or any other provision of law. The substance of this subsection shall appear upon every visa application.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Revocation of visas or documents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After the issuance of a visa or other documentation to any alien, the consular officer or the Secretary of State may at any time, in his discretion, revoke such visa or other documentation. Notice of such revocation shall be communicated to the Attorney General, and such revocation shall invalidate the visa or other documentation from the date of issuance: <em>Provided</em>, That carriers or transportation companies, and masters, commanding officers, agents, owners, charterers, or consignees, shall not be penalized under section 1323(b) of this title for action taken in reliance on such visas or other documentation, unless they received due notice of such revocation prior to the alien's embarkation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Immigrant visas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every alien applying for an immigrant visa and for alien registration shall make application therefor in such form and manner and at such place as shall be by regulations prescribed. In the application the alien shall state his full and true name, and any other name which he has used or by which he has been known; age and sex; the date and place of his birth; and such additional information necessary to the identification of the applicant and the enforcement of the immigration and nationality laws as may be by regulations prescribed.</p>

The copy of each document so furnished shall be permanently attached to the application and become a part thereof. In the event that the immigrant establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer that any document or record required by this subsection is unobtainable, the consular officer may permit the immigrant to submit in lieu of such document or record other satisfactory evidence of the fact to which such document or record would, if obtainable, pertain.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Signing and verification of application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as may be otherwise prescribed by regulations, each application for an immigrant visa shall be signed by the applicant in the presence of the consular officer, and verified by the oath of the applicant administered by the consular officer. The application for an immigrant visa, when visaed by the consular officer, shall become the immigrant visa. The application for a nonimmigrant visa or other documentation as a nonimmigrant shall be disposed of as may be by regulations prescribed. The issuance of a nonimmigrant visa shall, except as may be otherwise by regulations prescribed, be evidenced by a stamp, or other&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1202_1_target" name="1202_1">1</a></sup> placed in the alien's passport.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Confidential nature of records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The records of the Department of State and of diplomatic and consular offices of the United States pertaining to the issuance or refusal of visas or permits to enter the United States shall be considered confidential and shall be used only for the formulation, amendment, administration, or enforcement of the immigration, nationality, and other laws of the United States, except that in the discretion of the Secretary of State certified copies of such records may be made available to a court which certifies that the information contained in such records is needed by the court in the interest of the ends of justice in a case pending before the court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Nonimmigrant visa void at conclusion of authorized period of stay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of an alien who has been admitted on the basis of a nonimmigrant visa and remained in the United States beyond the period of stay authorized by the Attorney General, such visa shall be void beginning after the conclusion of such period of stay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An alien described in paragraph (1) shall be ineligible to be readmitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant, except&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) where extraordinary circumstances are found by the Secretary of State to exist.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Detention of aliens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of determining whether aliens (including alien crewmen) arriving at ports of the United States belong to any of the classes inadmissible under this chapter, by reason of being afflicted with any of the diseases or mental or physical defects or disabilities set forth in section 1182(a) of this title, or whenever the Attorney General has received information showing that any aliens are coming from a country or have embarked at a place where any of such diseases are prevalent or epidemic, such aliens shall be detained by the Attorney General for a sufficient time to enable the immigration officers and medical officers to subject such aliens to observation and an examination sufficient to determine whether or not they belong to inadmissible classes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Physical and mental examination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The physical and mental examination of arriving aliens (including alien crewmen) shall be made by medical officers of the United States Public Health Service, who shall conduct all medical examinations and shall certify, for the information of the immigration officers and the immigration judges, any physical and mental defect or disease observed by such medical officers in any such alien. If medical officers of the United States Public Health Service are not available, civil surgeons of not less than four years&rsquo; professional experience may be employed for such service upon such terms as may be prescribed by the Attorney General. Aliens (including alien crewmen) arriving at ports of the United States shall be examined by at least one such medical officer or civil surgeon under such administrative regulations as the Attorney General may prescribe, and under medical regulations prepared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Medical officers of the United States Public Health Service who have had special training in the diagnosis of insanity and mental defects shall be detailed for duty or employed at such ports of entry as the Attorney General may designate, and such medical officers shall be provided with suitable facilities for the detention and examination of all arriving aliens who it is suspected may be inadmissible under paragraph (1) of section 1182(a) of this title, and the services of interpreters shall be <!-- PDFPage:159 -->provided for such examination. Any alien certified under paragraph (1) of section 1182(a) of this title, may appeal to a board of medical officers of the United States Public Health Service, which shall be convened by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and any such alien may introduce before such board one expert medical witness at his own cost and expense.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certification of certain helpless aliens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an examining medical officer determines that an alien arriving in the United States is inadmissible, is helpless from sickness, mental or physical disability, or infancy, and is accompanied by another alien whose protection or guardianship may be required, the officer may certify such fact for purposes of applying section 1182(a)(10)(B) of this title with respect to the other alien.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General is authorized (1) by regulation to designate as ports of entry for aliens arriving by aircraft any of the ports of entry for civil aircraft designated as such in accordance with law; (2) by regulation to provide such reasonable requirements for aircraft in civil air navigation with respect to giving notice of intention to land in advance of landing, or notice of landing, as shall be deemed necessary for purposes of administration and enforcement of this chapter; and (3) by regulation to provide for the application to civil air navigation of the provisions of this chapter where not expressly so provided in this chapter to such extent and upon such conditions as he deems necessary. Any person who violates any regulation made under this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $2,000 which may be remitted or mitigated by the Attorney General in accordance with such proceedings as the Attorney General shall by regulation prescribe. In case the violation is by the owner or person in command of the aircraft, the penalty shall be a lien upon the aircraft, and such aircraft may be libeled therefore in the appropriate United States court. The determination by the Attorney General and remission or mitigation of the civil penalty shall be final. In case the violation is by the owner or person in command of the aircraft, the penalty shall be a lien upon the aircraft and may be collected by proceedings in rem which shall conform as nearly as may be to civil suits in admiralty. The Supreme Court of the United States, and under its direction other courts of the United States, are authorized to prescribe rules regulating such proceedings against aircraft in any particular not otherwise provided by law. Any aircraft made subject to a lien by this section may be summarily seized by, and placed in the custody of such persons as the Attorney General may by regulation prescribe. The aircraft may be released from such custody upon deposit of such amount not exceeding $2,000 as the Attorney General may prescribe, or of a bond in such sum and with such sureties as the Attorney General may prescribe, conditioned upon the payment of the penalty which may be finally determined by the Attorney General.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Inspection</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Aliens treated as applicants for admission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An alien present in the United States who has not been admitted or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international or United States waters) shall be deemed for purposes of this chapter an applicant for admission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Stowaways</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An arriving alien who is a stowaway is not eligible to apply for admission or to be admitted and shall be ordered removed upon inspection by an immigration officer. Upon such inspection if the alien indicates an intention to apply for asylum under section 1158 of this title or a fear of persecution, the officer shall refer the alien for an interview under subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section. A stowaway may apply for asylum only if the stowaway is found to have a credible fear of persecution under subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section. In no case may a stowaway be considered an applicant for admission or eligible for a hearing under section 1229a of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Inspection</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inspection of applicants for admission</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Claims for asylum</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If an immigration officer determines that an alien (other than an alien described in subparagraph (F)) who is arriving in the United States or is described in clause (iii) is inadmissible under section 1182(a)(6)(C) or 1182(a)(7) of this title and the alien indicates either an intention to apply for asylum under section 1158 of this title or a fear of persecution, the officer shall refer the alien for an interview by an asylum officer under subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Application to certain other aliens</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Aliens described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">An alien described in this clause is an alien who is not described in subparagraph (F), who has not been admitted or paroled into the United States, and who has not affirmatively shown, to the satisfaction of an immigration officer, that the alien has been physically present in the United States continuously for the 2-year period immediately prior to the date of the determination of inadmissibility under this subparagraph.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:162 --><h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Removal without further review if no credible fear of persecution</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">Subject to subclause (III), if the officer determines that an alien does not have a credible fear of persecution, the officer shall order the alien removed from the United States without further hearing or review.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Record of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The officer shall prepare a written record of a determination under subclause (I). Such record shall include a summary of the material facts as stated by the applicant, such additional facts (if any) relied upon by the officer, and the officer's analysis of why, in the light of such facts, the alien has not established a credible fear of persecution. A copy of the officer's interview notes shall be attached to the written summary.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(III) Review of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The Attorney General shall provide by regulation and upon the alien's request for prompt review by an immigration judge of a determination under subclause (I) that the alien does not have a credible fear of persecution. Such review shall include an opportunity for the alien to be heard and questioned by the immigration judge, either in person or by telephonic or video connection. Review shall be concluded as expeditiously as possible, to the maximum extent practicable within 24 hours, but in no case later than 7 days after the date of the determination under subclause (I).</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(v) &ldquo;Credible fear of persecution&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;credible fear of persecution&rdquo; means that there is a significant possibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the alien in support of the alien's claim and such other facts as are known to the officer, that the alien could establish eligibility for asylum under section 1158 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitation on administrative review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B)(iii)(III), a removal order entered in accordance with subparagraph (A)(i) or (B)(iii)(I) is not subject to administrative appeal, except that the Attorney General shall provide by regulation for prompt review of such an order under subparagraph (A)(i) against an alien who claims under oath, or as permitted under penalty of perjury under section 1746 of title 28, after having been warned of the penalties for falsely making such claim under such conditions, to have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence, to have been admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of this title, or to have been granted asylum under section 1158 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Limit on collateral attacks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any action brought against an alien under section 1325(a) of this title or section 1326 of this title, the court shall not have jurisdiction to hear any claim attacking the validity of an order of removal entered under subparagraph (A)(i) or (B)(iii).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), in the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission, if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a proceeding under section 1229a of this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Removal of criminal aliens</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) in general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall provide for the availability of special removal proceedings at certain Federal, State, and local correctional facilities for aliens convicted of any criminal offense covered in section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D) of this title, or any offense covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) of this title for which both predicate offenses are, without regard to the date of their commission, otherwise covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) of this title. Such proceedings shall be conducted in conformity with section 1229a of this title (except as otherwise provided in this section), and in a manner which eliminates the need for additional detention at any processing center of the Service and in a manner which assures expeditious removal following the end of the alien's incarceration for the underlying sentence. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create any substantive or procedural right or benefit that is legally enforceable by any party against the United States or its agencies or officers or any other person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to an alien convicted of an aggravated felony who is taken into custody by the Attorney General pursuant to section 1226(c) of this title, the Attorney General shall, to the maximum extent practicable, detain any such felon at a facility at which other such aliens are detained. In the selection of such facility, the Attorney General shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the alien's access to counsel and right to counsel under section 1362 of this title are not impaired.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Expedited proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Attorney General shall provide for the initiation and, to the extent possible, the completion of removal proceedings, and any administrative appeals thereof, in the case of any alien convicted of an aggravated felony before the alien's release from incarceration for the underlying aggravated felony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the Attorney General to effect the removal of any alien sentenced to actual incarceration, before release from the penitentiary or correctional institution where such alien is confined.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Attorney General shall review and evaluate removal proceedings conducted under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Comptroller General shall monitor, review, and evaluate removal proceedings conducted under this section. Within 18 months after the effective date of this section, the Comptroller General shall submit a report to such Committees concerning the extent to which removal proceedings conducted under this section may adversely affect the ability of such aliens to contest removal effectively.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Removal of aliens who are not permanent residents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Attorney General may, in the case of an alien described in paragraph (2), determine the deportability of such alien under section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) of this title (relating to conviction of an aggravated felony) and issue an order of removal pursuant to the procedures set forth in this subsection or section 1229a of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An alien is described in this paragraph if the alien&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) was not lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time at which proceedings under this section commenced; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) had permanent resident status on a conditional basis (as described in section 1186a of this title) at the time that proceedings under this section commenced.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Attorney General may not execute any order described in paragraph (1) until 14 calendar days have passed from the date that such order was issued, unless waived by the alien, in order that the alien has an opportunity to apply for judicial review under section 1252 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Proceedings before the Attorney General under this subsection shall be in accordance with such regulations as the Attorney General shall prescribe. The Attorney General shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the alien is given reasonable notice of the charges and of the opportunity described in subparagraph (C);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the alien shall have the privilege of being represented (at no expense to the government) by such counsel, authorized to practice in such proceedings, as the alien shall choose;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the alien has a reasonable opportunity to inspect the evidence and rebut the charges;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a determination is made for the record that the individual upon whom the notice for the proceeding under this section is served (either in person or by mail) is, in fact, the alien named in such notice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) a record is maintained for judicial review; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the final order of removal is not adjudicated by the same person who issues the charges.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) No alien described in this section shall be eligible for any relief from removal that the Attorney General may grant in the Attorney General's discretion.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1228_1_target" name="1228_1">1</a></sup> Presumption of deportability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An alien convicted of an aggravated felony shall be conclusively presumed to be deportable from the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1228_1_target" name="1228_1">1</a></sup> Judicial removal</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a United States district court shall have jurisdiction to enter a judicial order of removal at the time of sentencing against an alien who is deportable, if such an order has been requested by the United States Attorney with the concurrence of the Commissioner and <!-- PDFPage:175 -->if the court chooses to exercise such jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The United States Attorney shall file with the United States district court, and serve upon the defendant and the Service, prior to commencement of the trial or entry of a guilty plea a notice of intent to request judicial removal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notwithstanding section 1252b&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1228_2_target" name="1228_2">2</a></sup> of this title, the United States Attorney, with the concurrence of the Commissioner, shall file at least 30 days prior to the date set for sentencing a charge containing factual allegations regarding the alienage of the defendant and identifying the crime or crimes which make the defendant deportable under section 1227(a)(2)(A) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) If the court determines that the defendant has presented substantial evidence to establish prima facie eligibility for relief from removal under this chapter, the Commissioner shall provide the court with a recommendation and report regarding the alien's eligibility for relief. The court shall either grant or deny the relief sought.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D)(i) The alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against him or her, to present evidence on his or her own behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The court, for the purposes of determining whether to enter an order described in paragraph (1), shall only consider evidence that would be admissible in proceedings conducted pursuant to section 1229a of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Nothing in this subsection shall limit the information a court of the United States may receive or consider for the purposes of imposing an appropriate sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) The court may order the alien removed if the Attorney General demonstrates that the alien is deportable under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice, appeal, and execution of judicial order of removal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) A judicial order of removal or denial of such order may be appealed by either party to the court of appeals for the circuit in which the district court is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Except as provided in clause (iii), such appeal shall be considered consistent with the requirements described in section 1252 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Upon execution by the defendant of a valid waiver of the right to appeal the conviction on which the order of removal is based, the expiration of the period described in section 1252(b)(1) of this title, or the final dismissal of an appeal from such conviction, the order of removal shall become final and shall be executed at the end of the prison term in accordance with the terms of the order. If the conviction is reversed on direct appeal, the order entered pursuant to this section shall be void.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) As soon as is practicable after entry of a judicial order of removal, the Commissioner shall provide the defendant with written notice of the order of removal, which shall designate the defendant's country of choice for removal and any alternate country pursuant to section 1253(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Denial of judicial order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Denial of a request for a judicial order of removal shall not preclude the Attorney General from initiating removal proceedings pursuant to section 1229a of this title upon the same ground of deportability or upon any other ground of deportability provided under section 1227(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Stipulated judicial order of removal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The United States Attorney, with the concurrence of the Commissioner, may, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11, enter into a plea agreement which calls for the alien, who is deportable under this chapter, to waive the right to notice and a hearing under this section, and stipulate to the entry of a judicial order of removal from the United States as a condition of the plea agreement or as a condition of probation or supervised release, or both. The United States district court, in both felony and misdemeanor cases, and a United States magistrate judge in misdemeanor cases, may accept such a stipulation and shall have jurisdiction to enter a judicial order of removal pursuant to the terms of such stipulation.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Detention, release, and removal of aliens ordered removed</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Removal period</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as otherwise provided in this section, when an alien is ordered removed, the Attorney General shall remove the alien from the United States within a period of 90 days (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;removal period&rdquo;).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Beginning of period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The removal period begins on the latest of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The date the order of removal becomes administratively final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) If the removal order is judicially reviewed and if a court orders a stay of the removal of the alien, the date of the court's final order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) If the alien is detained or confined (except under an immigration process), the date the alien is released from detention or confinement.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Suspension of period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The removal period shall be extended beyond a period of 90 days and the alien may remain in detention during such extended period if the alien fails or refuses to make timely application in good faith for travel or other documents necessary to the alien's departure or conspires or acts to prevent the alien's removal subject to an order of removal.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Detention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the removal period, the Attorney General shall detain the alien. Under no circumstance during the removal period shall the Attorney General release an alien who has been found inadmissible under section 1182(a)(2) or 1182(a)(3)(B) of this title or deportable under section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4)(B) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Supervision after 90-day period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the alien does not leave or is not removed within the removal period, the alien, pending removal, shall be subject to supervision under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General. The regulations shall include provisions requiring the alien&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to appear before an immigration officer periodically for identification;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to submit, if necessary, to a medical and psychiatric examination at the expense of the United States Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to give information under oath about the alien's nationality, circumstances, habits, associations, and activities, and other information the Attorney General considers appropriate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to obey reasonable written restrictions on the alien's conduct or activities that the Attorney General prescribes for the alien.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Aliens imprisoned, arrested, or on parole, supervised release, or probation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in section 259(a) of title 42 and paragraph (2), the Attorney General <!-- PDFPage:185 -->may not remove an alien who is sentenced to imprisonment until the alien is released from imprisonment. Parole, supervised release, probation, or possibility of arrest or further imprisonment is not a reason to defer removal.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception for removal of nonviolent offenders prior to completion of sentence of imprisonment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General is authorized to remove an alien in accordance with applicable procedures under this chapter before the alien has completed a sentence of imprisonment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of an alien in the custody of the Attorney General, if the Attorney General determines that (I) the alien is confined pursuant to a final conviction for a nonviolent offense (other than an offense related to smuggling or harboring of aliens or an offense described in section 1101(a)(43)(B), (C), (E), (I), or (L) of this title&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1231_1_target" name="1231_1">1</a></sup> and (II) the removal of the alien is appropriate and in the best interest of the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of an alien in the custody of a State (or a political subdivision of a State), if the chief State official exercising authority with respect to the incarceration of the alien determines that (I) the alien is confined pursuant to a final conviction for a nonviolent offense (other than an offense described in section 1101(a)(43)(C) or (E) of this title), (II) the removal is appropriate and in the best interest of the State, and (III) submits a written request to the Attorney General that such alien be so removed.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any alien removed pursuant to this paragraph shall be notified of the penalties under the laws of the United States relating to the reentry of deported aliens, particularly the expanded penalties for aliens removed under subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) No private right</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No cause or claim may be asserted under this paragraph against any official of the United States or of any State to compel the release, removal, or consideration for release or removal of any alien.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Reinstatement of removal orders against aliens illegally reentering</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Attorney General finds that an alien has reentered the United States illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily, under an order of removal, the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed, the alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under this chapter, and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Inadmissible or criminal aliens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An alien ordered removed who is inadmissible under section 1182 of this title, removable under section 1227(a)(1)(C), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(4) of this title or who has been determined by the Attorney General to be a risk to the community or unlikely to comply with the order of removal, may be detained beyond the removal period and, if released, shall be subject to the terms of supervision in paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Employment authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No alien ordered removed shall be eligible to receive authorization to be employed in the United States unless the Attorney General makes a specific finding that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the alien cannot be removed due to the refusal of all countries designated by the alien or under this section to receive the alien, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the removal of the alien is otherwise impracticable or contrary to the public interest.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Alternative countries</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Disregarding designation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the government of the country is not willing to accept the alien into the country; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the Attorney General decides that removing the alien to the country is prejudicial to the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Alternative country</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an alien is not removed to a country designated under subparagraph (A)(i), the Attorney General shall remove the alien to a country of which the alien is a subject, national, or citizen unless the government of the country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) does not inform the Attorney General or the alien finally, within 30 days after the date the Attorney General first inquires or within another period of time the Attorney General decides is reasonable, whether the government will accept the alien into the country; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any other decision or action of the Attorney General the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General, other than the granting of relief under section 1158(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Orders against criminal aliens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section 1182(a)(2) or 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D) of this title, or any offense covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) of this title for which both predicate offenses are, without regard to their date of commission, otherwise covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of certain decisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No alien shall have a right to appeal from a decision of an immigration judge which is based solely on a certification described in section 1229a(c)(1)(B) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Requirements for review of orders of removal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to review of an order of removal under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the following requirements apply:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Deadline</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The petition for review must be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Venue and forms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The petition for review shall be filed with the court of appeals for the judicial circuit in which the immigration judge completed the proceedings. The record and briefs do not have to be printed. The court of appeals shall review the proceeding on a typewritten record and on typewritten briefs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Service</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The respondent is the Attorney General. The petition shall be served on the Attorney General and on the officer or employee of the Service in charge of the Service district in which the final order of removal under section 1229a of this title was entered.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Stay of order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Service of the petition on the officer or employee does not stay the removal of an alien pending the court's decision on the petition, unless the court orders otherwise.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Alien's brief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The alien shall serve and file a brief in connection with a petition for judicial review not later than 40 days after the date on which the administrative record is available, and may serve and file a reply brief not later than 14 days after service of the brief of the Attorney General, and the court may not extend these deadlines except upon motion for good cause shown. If an alien fails to file a brief within the time provided in this paragraph, the court shall dismiss the appeal unless a manifest injustice would result.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Scope and standard for review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (5)(B)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a decision that an alien is not eligible for admission to the United States is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the Attorney General's discretionary judgment whether to grant relief under section 1158(a) of this title shall be conclusive unless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Treatment of nationality claims</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Court determination if no issue of fact</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the petitioner claims to be a national of the United States and the court of appeals finds from the pleadings and affidavits that no genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner's nationality is presented, the court shall decide the nationality claim.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Transfer if issue of fact</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the petitioner claims to be a national of the United States and the court of appeals finds that a genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner's nationality is presented, the court shall transfer the proceeding to the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the petitioner resides for a new hearing on the nationality claim and a decision on that claim as if an action had been brought in the district court under section 2201 of title 28.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitation on determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The petitioner may have such nationality claim decided only as provided in this paragraph.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Challenge to validity of orders in certain criminal proceedings</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the validity of an order of removal has not been judicially decided, a defendant in a criminal proceeding charged with violating section 1253(a) of this title may challenge the validity of the order in the criminal proceeding only by filing a separate motion before trial. The district court, without a jury, shall decide the motion before trial.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Claims of United States nationality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the defendant claims in the motion to be a national of the United States and the district court finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) no genuine issue of material fact about the defendant's nationality is presented, the court shall decide the motion only on the administrative record on which the removal order is based and the administrative findings of fact are conclusive if supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a genuine issue of material fact about the defendant's nationality is presented, the court shall hold a new hearing on the nationality claim and decide that claim as if an action had been brought under section 2201 of title 28.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The defendant may have such nationality claim decided only as provided in this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Consequence of invalidation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) does not relieve the alien from complying with section 1231(a)(4) of this title and section 1253(g) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) does not require the Attorney General to defer removal of the alien.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Judicial review of all questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Review of final orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A court may review a final order of removal only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) another court has not decided the validity of the order, unless the reviewing court finds that the petition presents grounds that could not have been presented in the prior judicial proceeding or that the remedy provided by the prior proceeding was inadequate or ineffective to test the validity of the order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) whether such section, or any regulation issued to implement such section, is constitutional; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) whether such a regulation, or a written policy directive, written policy guideline, or written procedure issued by or under the authority of the Attorney General to implement such section, is not consistent with applicable provisions of this subchapter or is otherwise in violation of law.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Expeditious consideration of cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">It shall be the duty of the District Court, the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court of the United States to advance on the docket and to expedite to the greatest possible extent the disposition of any case considered under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case where the court determines that the petitioner&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is an alien who was not ordered removed under section 1225(b)(1) of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the alien is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, has been admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of this title, or has been granted asylum under section 1158 of this title, the court may order no remedy or relief other than to require that the petitioner be provided a hearing in accordance with section 1229a of this title.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Scope of inquiry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining whether an alien has been ordered removed under section 1225(b)(1) of this title, the court's inquiry shall be limited to whether such an order in fact was issued and whether it relates to the petitioner. There shall be no review of whether the alien is actually inadmissible or entitled to any relief from removal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limit on injunctive relief</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Granting of status</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an alien who is a national of a foreign state designated under subsection (b) of this section (or in the case of an alien having no nationality, is a person who last habitually resided in such designated state) and who meets the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, the Attorney General, in accordance with this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may grant the alien temporary protected status in the United States and shall not remove the alien from the United States during the period in which such status is in effect, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall authorize the alien to engage in employment in the United States and provide the alien with an &ldquo;employment authorized&rdquo; endorsement or other appropriate work permit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Duration of work authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Work authorization provided under this section shall be effective throughout the period <!-- PDFPage:199 -->the alien is in temporary protected status under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Upon the granting of temporary protected status under this section, the Attorney General shall provide the alien with information concerning such status under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If, at the time of initiation of a removal proceeding against an alien, the foreign state (of which the alien is a national) is designated under subsection (b) of this section, the Attorney General shall promptly notify the alien of the temporary protected status that may be available under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) If, at the time of designation of a foreign state under subsection (b) of this section, an alien (who is a national of such state) is in a removal proceeding under this subchapter, the Attorney General shall promptly notify the alien of the temporary protected status that may be available under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Notices under this paragraph shall be provided in a form and language that the alien can understand.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Temporary treatment for eligible aliens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the case of an alien who can establish a prima facie case of eligibility for benefits under paragraph (1), but for the fact that the period of registration under subsection (c)(1)(A)(iv) of this section has not begun, until the alien has had a reasonable opportunity to register during the first 30 days of such period, the Attorney General shall provide for the benefits of paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In the case of an alien who establishes a prima facie case of eligibility for benefits under paragraph (1), until a final determination with respect to the alien's eligibility for such benefits under paragraph (1) has been made, the alien shall be provided such benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Clarification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing the Attorney General to deny temporary protected status to an alien based on the alien's immigration status or to require any alien, as a condition of being granted such status, either to relinquish nonimmigrant or other status the alien may have or to execute any waiver of other rights under this chapter. The granting of temporary protected status under this section shall not be considered to be inconsistent with the granting of nonimmigrant status under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Designations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General, after consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government, may designate any foreign state (or any part of such foreign state) under this subsection only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Attorney General finds that there is an ongoing armed conflict within the state and, due to such conflict, requiring the return of aliens who are nationals of that state to that state (or to the part of the state) would pose a serious threat to their personal safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Attorney General finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) there has been an earthquake, flood, drought, epidemic, or other environmental disaster in the state resulting in a substantial, but temporary, disruption of living conditions in the area affected,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the foreign state is unable, temporarily, to handle adequately the return to the state of aliens who are nationals of the state, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the foreign state officially has requested designation under this subparagraph; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Attorney General finds that there exist extraordinary and temporary conditions in the foreign state that prevent aliens who are nationals of the state from returning to the state in safety, unless the Attorney General finds that permitting the aliens to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to the national interest of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A designation of a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) under this paragraph shall not become effective unless notice of the designation (including a statement of the findings under this paragraph and the effective date of the designation) is published in the Federal Register. In such notice, the Attorney General shall also state an estimate of the number of nationals of the foreign state designated who are (or within the effective period of the designation are likely to become) eligible for temporary protected status under this section and their immigration status in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effective period of designation for foreign states</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The designation of a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) under paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) For purposes of paragraphs (1)(A)(i) and (3)(B), an alien shall not be considered to have failed to maintain continuous physical presence in the United States by virtue of brief, casual, and innocent absences from the United States, without regard to whether such absences were authorized by the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of paragraph (1)(A)(ii), an alien shall not be considered to have failed to maintain continuous residence in the United States by reason of a brief, casual, and innocent absence described in subparagraph (A) or due merely to a brief temporary trip abroad required by emergency or extenuating circumstances outside the control of the alien.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effective date of terminations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Attorney General terminates the designation of a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) under subsection (b)(3)(B) of this section, such termination shall only apply to documentation and authorization issued or renewed after the effective date of the publication of notice of the determination under that subsection (or, at the Attorney General's option, after such period after the effective date of the determination as the Attorney General determines to be appropriate in order to provide for an orderly transition).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise specifically provided, this section shall constitute the exclusive authority of the Attorney General under law to permit aliens who are or may become otherwise deportable or have been paroled into the United States to remain in the United States temporarily because of their particular nationality or region of foreign state of nationality.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Record of admission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, after consultation with the Secretary of State, it shall appear to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the alien has shown compelling reasons demonstrating both that the alien is unable to return to the country represented by the government which accredited the alien or the member of the alien's immediate family and that adjustment of the alien's status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence would be in the national interest, that the alien is a person of good moral character, that he is admissible for permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.], and that such action would not be contrary to the national welfare, safety, or security, the Attorney General, in his discretion, may record the alien's lawful admission for permanent residence as of the date the order of the Attorney General approving the application for adjustment of status is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Report to the Congress; resolution not favoring adjustment of status; reduction of quota</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A complete and detailed statement of the facts and pertinent provisions of law in the case shall be reported to the Congress with the reasons for such adjustment of status.

No quota shall be so reduced by more than 50 per centum in any fiscal year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">No alien crewman shall be permitted to land temporarily in the United States except as provided in this section and sections 1182(d)(3), (5) and 1283 of this title. If an immigration officer finds upon examination that an alien crewman is a nonimmigrant under paragraph (15)(D) of section 1101(a) of this title and is otherwise admissible and has agreed to accept such permit, he may, in his discretion, grant the crewman a conditional permit to land temporarily pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, subject to revocation in subsequent proceedings as provided in subsection (b) of this section, and for a period of time, in any event, not to exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the period of time (not exceeding twenty-nine days) during which the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived remains in port, if the immigration officer is satisfied that the crewman intends to depart on the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) twenty-nine days, if the immigration officer is satisfied that the crewman intends to depart, within the period for which he is permitted to land, on a vessel or aircraft other than the one on which he arrived.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Revocation; expenses of detention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, any immigration officer may, in his discretion, if he determines that an alien is not a bona fide crewman, or does not intend to depart on the vessel or aircraft which brought him, revoke the conditional permit to land which was granted such crewman under the provisions of subsection (a)(1) of this section, take such crewman into custody, and require the master or commanding officer of the vessel or aircraft on which the crewman arrived to receive and detain him on board such vessel or aircraft, if practicable, and such crewman shall be removed from the United States at the expense of the transportation line which brought him to the United States. Until such alien is so removed, any expenses of his detention shall be borne by such transportation company. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the procedure prescribed in section 1229a of this title to cases falling within the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any alien crewman who willfully remains in the United States in excess of the number of days allowed in any conditional permit issued under subsection (a) of this section shall be fined under title 18 or imprisoned not more than 6 months, or both.</p>

No such vessel or aircraft shall be granted clearance until such expenses are paid, or their payment appropriately guaranteed, and the collector of customs is so notified by the immigration officer in charge. An alien crewman suspected of being afflicted with any such disability or disease may be removed from the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived to an immigration station, or other appropriate place, for such observation as will enable the examining surgeons to determine definitely whether or not he is so afflicted, all expenses connected therewith to be borne in the manner hereinbefore prescribed. In cases in which it appears to the satisfaction of the immigration officer in charge that it will not be possible within a reasonable time to effect a cure, the return of the alien crewman shall be enforced on, or at the expense of, the transportation line on which he came, upon such conditions as the Attorney General shall prescribe, to insure that the alien shall be properly cared for and protected, and that the spread of contagion shall be guarded against.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Penalties for failure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The owner, agent, consignee, charterer, master, or commanding officer of any vessel or aircraft arriving in the United States from any place outside thereof who fails (1) to detain on board the vessel, or in the case of an aircraft to detain at a place specified by an immigration officer at the expense of the airline, any alien crewman employed thereon until an immigration officer has completely inspected such alien crewman, including a physical examination by the medical examiner, or (2) to detain any alien crewman on board the vessel, or in the case of an aircraft at a place specified by an immigration officer at the expense of the airline, after such inspection unless a conditional permit to land temporarily has been granted such alien crewman under section 1282 of this title or unless an alien crewman has been permitted to land temporarily under section 1182(d)(5) or 1283 of this title for medical or hospital treatment, or (3) to remove such alien crewman if required to do so by an immigration officer, whether such removal requirement is imposed before or after the crewman is permitted to land temporarily under section 1182(d)(5), 1282, or 1283 of this title, shall pay to the Commissioner the sum of $3,000 for each alien crewman in respect to whom any such failure occurs. No such vessel or aircraft shall be granted clearance pending the determination of the liability to the payment of such fine, or while the fine remains unpaid, except that clearance may be granted prior to the determination of such question upon the deposit of a sum sufficient to cover such fine, or of a bond with sufficient surety to secure the payment thereof approved by the Commissioner. The Attorney General may, upon application in writing therefor, mitigate such penalty to not less than $500 for each alien crewman in respect of whom such failure occurs, upon such terms as he shall think proper.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Prima facie evidence against transportation line</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as may be otherwise prescribed by regulations issued by the Attorney General, proof that an alien crewman did not appear upon the outgoing manifest of the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived in the United States from any place outside thereof, or that he was reported by the master or commanding officer of such vessel or aircraft as a deserter, shall be prima facie evidence of a failure to detain or remove such alien crewman.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Removal on other than arriving vessel or aircraft; expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Attorney General finds that removal of an alien crewman under this section on the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived is impracticable or impossible, or would cause undue hardship to such alien crewman, he may cause the alien crewman to be removed from the port of arrival or any other port on another vessel or aircraft of the same transportation line, unless the Attorney General finds this to be impracticable. All expenses incurred in connection with such removal, including expenses incurred in transferring an alien crewman from one place in the <!-- PDFPage:230 -->United States to another under such conditions and safeguards as the Attorney General shall impose, shall be paid by the owner or owners of the vessel or aircraft on which the alien arrived in the United States. The vessel or aircraft on which the alien arrived shall not be granted clearance until such expenses have been paid or their payment guaranteed to the satisfaction of the Attorney General. An alien crewman who is transferred within the United States in accordance with this subsection shall not be regarded as having been landed in the United States.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of section 1101(a)(15)(D)(i) of this title, the term &ldquo;normal operation and service on board a vessel&rdquo; does not include any activity that is longshore work (as defined in subsection (b) of this section), except as provided under subsection (c), (d), or (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Longshore work&rdquo; defined</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this section, except as provided in paragraph (2), the term &ldquo;longshore work&rdquo; means any activity relating to the loading or unloading of cargo, the operation of cargo-related equipment (whether or not integral to the vessel), and the handling of mooring lines on the dock when the vessel is made fast or let go, in the United States or the coastal waters thereof.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception for safety and environmental protection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;longshore work&rdquo; does not include the loading or unloading of any cargo for which the Secretary of Transportation has, under the authority contained in chapter 37 of title 46 (relating to Carriage of Liquid Bulk Dangerous Cargoes), section 1321 of title 33, section 4106 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or section 5103(b), 5104, 5106, 5107, or 5110 of title 49 prescribed regulations which govern&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the handling or stowage of such cargo,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the manning of vessels and the duties, qualifications, and training of the officers and crew of vessels carrying such cargo, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the reduction or elimination of discharge during ballasting, tank cleaning, handling of such cargo.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed as broadening, limiting, or otherwise modifying the meaning or scope of longshore work for purposes of any other law, collective bargaining agreement, or international agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prevailing practice exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to a particular activity of longshore work in and about a local port if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) there is in effect in the local port one or more collective bargaining agreements each covering at least 30 percent of the number of individuals employed in performing longshore work and (ii) each such agreement (covering such percentage of longshore workers) permits the activity to be performed by alien crewmen under the terms of such agreement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) there is no collective bargaining agreement in effect in the local port covering at least 30 percent of the number of individuals employed in performing longshore work, and an employer of alien crewmen (or the employ<!-- PDFPage:232 -->er's designated agent or representative) has filed with the Secretary of Labor at least 14 days before the date of performance of the activity (or later, if necessary due to an unanticipated emergency, but not later than the date of performance of the activity) an attestation setting forth facts and evidence to show that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the performance of the activity by alien crewmen is permitted under the prevailing practice of the particular port as of the date of filing of the attestation and that the use of alien crewmen for such activity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) is not during a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) is not intended or designed to influence an election of a bargaining representative for workers in the local port; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) notice of the attestation has been provided by the owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer to the bargaining representative of longshore workers in the local port, or, where there is no such bargaining representative, notice of the attestation has been provided to longshore workers employed at the local port.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In applying subparagraph (B) in the case of a particular activity of longshore work consisting of the use of an automated self-unloading conveyor belt or vacuum-actuated system on a vessel, the attestation shall be required to be filed only if the Secretary of Labor finds, based on a preponderance of the evidence which may be submitted by any interested party, that the performance of such particular activity is not described in clause (i) of such subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to paragraph (4), an attestation under paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) expire at the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date of its filing with the Secretary of Labor, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) apply to aliens arriving in the United States during such 1-year period if the owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer states in each list under section 1281 of this title that it continues to comply with the conditions in the attestation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer may meet the requirements under this subsection with respect to more than one alien crewman in a single list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Secretary of Labor shall compile and make available for public examination in a timely manner in Washington, D.C., a list identifying owners, agents, consignees, masters, or commanding officers which have filed lists for nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(D)(i) of this title with respect to whom an attestation under paragraph (1) or subsection (d)(1) of this section is made and, for each such entity, a copy of the entity's attestation under paragraph (1) or subsection (d)(1) of this section (and accompanying documentation) and each such list filed by the entity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process for the receipt, investigation, and disposition of complaints respecting an entity's failure to meet conditions attested to, an entity's misrepresentation of a material fact in an attestation, or, in the case described in the last sentence of paragraph (1), whether the performance of the particular activity is or is not described in paragraph (1)(B)(i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or organization (including bargaining representatives, associations deemed appropriate by the Secretary, and other aggrieved parties as determined under regulations of the Secretary).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Secretary shall promptly conduct an investigation under this subparagraph if there is reasonable cause to believe that an entity fails to meet conditions attested to, an entity has misrepresented a material fact in the attestation, or, in the case described in the last sentence of paragraph (1), the performance of the particular activity is not described in paragraph (1)(B)(i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) If the Secretary determines that reasonable cause exists to conduct an investigation with respect to an attestation, a complaining party may request that the activities attested to by the employer cease during the hearing process described in subparagraph (D). If such a request is made, the attesting employer shall be issued notice of such request and shall respond within 14 days to the notice. If the Secretary makes an initial determination that the complaining party's position is supported by a preponderance of the evidence submitted, the Secretary shall require immediately that the employer cease and desist from such activities until completion of the process described in subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the Secretary determines that reasonable cause exists to conduct an investigation with respect to a matter under the last sentence of paragraph (1), a complaining party may request that the activities of the employer cease during the hearing process described in subparagraph (D) unless the employer files with the Secretary of Labor an attestation under paragraph (1). If such a request is made, the employer shall be issued notice of such request and shall respond within 14 days to the notice. If the Secretary makes an initial determination that the complaining party's position is supported by a preponderance of the evidence submitted, the Secretary shall require immediately that the employer cease and desist from such activities until completion of the process described in subparagraph (D) unless the employer files with the Secretary of Labor an attestation under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Under the process established under subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall provide, within 180 days after the date a complaint is filed (or later for good cause shown), for a determination as to whether or not a basis exists to make a finding described in subparagraph (E). The Secretary shall provide notice of such determination to the interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing on the complaint within 60 days of the date of the determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that an entity has failed to meet a condition attested to or has made a misrepresentation of material fact in the attestation, the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative <!-- PDFPage:233 -->remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed $5,000 for each alien crewman performing unauthorized longshore work) as the Secretary determines to be appropriate. Upon receipt of such notice, the Attorney General shall not permit the vessels owned or chartered by such entity to enter any port of the United States during a period of up to 1 year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that, in the case described in the last sentence of paragraph (1), the performance of the particular activity is not described in subparagraph (B)(i), the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such finding and, thereafter, the attestation described in paragraph (1) shall be required of the employer for the performance of the particular activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) A finding by the Secretary of Labor under this paragraph that the performance of an activity by alien crewmen is not permitted under the prevailing practice of a local port shall preclude for one year the filing of a subsequent attestation concerning such activity in the port under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Except as provided in paragraph (5) of subsection (d) of this section, this subsection shall not apply to longshore work performed in the State of Alaska.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) State of Alaska exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to a particular activity of longshore work at a particular location in the State of Alaska if an employer of alien crewmen has filed an attestation with the Secretary of Labor at least 30 days before the date of the first performance of the activity (or anytime up to 24 hours before the first performance of the activity, upon a showing that the employer could not have reasonably anticipated the need to file an attestation for that location at that time) setting forth facts and evidence to show that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the employer will make a bona fide request for United States longshore workers who are qualified and available in sufficient numbers to perform the activity at the particular time and location from the parties to whom notice has been provided under clauses (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (D), except that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) contract stevedoring companies which employ or intend to employ United States longshore workers at that location, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) operators of private docks at which the employer will use longshore workers.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Persons liable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) It shall be unlawful for any person, including any transportation company, or the owner, master, commanding officer, agent, charterer, or consignee of any vessel or aircraft, to bring to the United States from any place outside thereof (other than from foreign contiguous territory) any alien who does not have a valid passport and an unexpired visa, if a visa was required under this chapter or regulations issued thereunder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) It is unlawful for an owner, agent, master, commanding officer, person in charge, purser, or consignee of a vessel or aircraft who is bringing an alien (except an alien crewmember) to the United States to take any consideration to be kept or returned contingent on whether an alien is admitted to, or ordered removed from, the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If it appears to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that any alien has been so brought, such person, or transportation company, or the master, commanding officer, agent, owner, charterer, or consignee of any such vessel or aircraft, shall pay to the Commissioner a fine of $3,000 for each alien so brought and, except in the case of any such alien who is admitted, or permitted to land temporarily, in addition, an amount equal to that paid by such alien for his transportation from the initial point of departure, indicated in his ticket, to the port of arrival, such latter fine to be delivered by the Commissioner to the alien on whose account the assessment is made. No vessel or aircraft shall be granted clearance pending the determination of the liability to the payment of such fine or while such fine remains unpaid, except that clearance may be granted prior to the determination of such question upon the deposit of an amount sufficient to cover such fine, or of a bond with sufficient surety to secure the payment thereof approved by the Commissioner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Remission or refund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, such fine shall not be remitted or refunded, unless it appears to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that such person, and the owner, master, commanding officer, agent, charterer, and consignee of the vessel or aircraft, prior to the departure of the vessel or aircraft from the last port outside the United States, did not know, and could not have ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence, that the individual transported was an alien and that a valid passport or visa was required.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Repealed. Pub. L. 104&ndash;208, div. C, title III, &sect;308(e)(13), Sept. 30, 1996, 110 Stat. 3009&ndash;620</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reduction, refund, or waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A fine under this section may be reduced, refunded, or waived under such regulations as the Attorney General shall prescribe in cases in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the carrier demonstrates that it had screened all passengers on the vessel or aircraft in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Attorney General, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) circumstances exist that the Attorney General determines would justify such reduction, refund, or waiver.</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A document described in this subparagraph is an individual's&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) is evidence of authorization of employment in the United States, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) contains security features to make it resistant to tampering, counterfeiting, and fraudulent use.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Documents evidencing employment authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A document described in this subparagraph is an individual's&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) driver's license or similar document issued for the purpose of identification by a State, if it contains a photograph of the individual or such other personal identifying information relating to the individual as the Attorney General finds, by regulation, sufficient for purposes of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of individuals under 16 years of age or in a State which does not provide for issuance of an identification document (other than a driver's license) referred to in clause (i), documentation of personal identity of such other type as the Attorney General finds, by regulation, provides a reliable means of identification.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Authority to prohibit use of certain documents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Attorney General finds, by regulation, that any document described in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) as establishing employment authorization or identity does not reliably establish such authorization or identity or is being used fraudulently to an unacceptable degree, the Attorney General may prohibit or place conditions on its use for purposes of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Individual attestation of employment authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The individual must attest, under penalty of perjury on the form designated or established for purposes of paragraph (1), that the individual is a citizen or national of the United States, an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or an alien who is authorized under this chapter or by the Attorney General to be hired, recruited, or referred for such employment.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12989, Feb. 13, 1996, 61 F.R. 6091, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">This order is designed to promote economy and efficiency in Government procurement. Stability and dependability are important elements of economy and efficiency. A contractor whose work force is less stable will be less likely to produce goods and services economically and efficiently than a contractor whose work force is more stable. It remains the policy of this Administration to enforce the immigration laws to the fullest extent, including the detection and deportation of illegal aliens. In these circumstances, contractors cannot rely on the continuing availability and service of illegal aliens, and contractors that choose to employ unauthorized aliens inevitably will have a less stable and less dependable work force than contractors that do not employ such persons. Because of this Administration's vigorous enforcement policy, contractors that employ unauthorized alien workers are necessarily less stable and dependable procurement sources than contractors that do not hire such persons. I find, therefore, that adherence to the general policy of not contracting with providers that knowingly employ unauthorized alien workers will promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, and by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including 40 U.S.C. 486(a) and 3 U.S.C. 301, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. (a) It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, contracting agencies should not contract with employers that have not complied with section 274A(a)(1)(A) and 274A(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324a(a)(1)(A), 1324a(a)(2)) (the &ldquo;INA employment provisions&rdquo;) prohibiting the unlawful employment of aliens.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Prohibition of discrimination based on national origin or citizenship status</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is an unfair immigration-related employment practice for a person or other entity to discriminate against any individual (other than an unauthorized alien, as defined in section 1324a(h)(3) of this title) with respect to the hiring, or recruitment or referral for a fee, of the individual for employment or the discharging of the individual from employment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) because of such individual's national origin, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a protected individual (as defined in paragraph (3)), because of such individual's citizenship status.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a person or other entity that employs three or fewer employees,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a person's or entity's discrimination because of an individual's national origin if the discrimination with respect to that person or entity and that individual is covered under section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000e&ndash;2], or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) discrimination because of citizenship status which is otherwise required in order to comply with law, regulation, or executive order, or required by Federal, State, or local government contract, or which the Attorney General determines to be essential for an employer to do business with an agency or department of the Federal, State, or local government.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) &ldquo;Protected individual&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As used in paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;protected individual&rdquo; means an individual who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is a citizen or national of the United States, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence, is granted the status of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence under section 1160(a) or 1255a(a)(1) of this title, is admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of this title, or is granted asylum under section 1158 of this title; but does not include (i) an alien who fails to apply for naturalization within six months of the date the alien first becomes eligible (by virtue of period of lawful permanent residence) to apply for naturalization or, if later, within six months after November 6, 1986, and (ii) an alien who has applied on a timely basis, but has not been naturalized as a citizen within 2 years after the date of the application, unless the alien can establish that the alien is actively pursuing naturalization, except that time consumed in the Service's processing the application shall not be counted toward the 2-year period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Additional exception providing right to prefer equally qualified citizens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, it is not an unfair immigration-related employment practice for a person or other entity to prefer to hire, recruit, or refer an individual who is a citizen or national of the United States over another individual who is an alien if the two individuals are equally qualified.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Prohibition of intimidation or retaliation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is also an unfair immigration-related employment practice for a person or other entity <!-- PDFPage:259 -->to intimidate, threaten, coerce, or retaliate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured under this section or because the individual intends to file or has filed a charge or a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this section. An individual so intimidated, threatened, coerced, or retaliated against shall be considered, for purposes of subsections (d) and (g) of this section, to have been discriminated against.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Treatment of certain documentary practices as employment practices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person's or other entity's request, for purposes of satisfying the requirements of section 1324a(b) of this title, for more or different documents than are required under such section or refusing to honor documents tendered that on their face reasonably appear to be genuine shall be treated as an unfair immigration-related employment practice if made for the purpose or with the intent of discriminating against an individual in violation of paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Charges of violations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), any person alleging that the person is adversely affected directly by an unfair immigration-related employment practice (or a person on that person's behalf) or an officer of the Service alleging that an unfair immigration-related employment practice has occurred or is occurring may file a charge respecting such practice or violation with the Special Counsel (appointed under subsection (c) of this section). Charges shall be in writing under oath or affirmation and shall contain such information as the Attorney General requires. The Special Counsel by certified mail shall serve a notice of the charge (including the date, place, and circumstances of the alleged unfair immigration-related employment practice) on the person or entity involved within 10 days.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) No overlap with EEOC complaints</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No charge may be filed respecting an unfair immigration-related employment practice described in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section if a charge with respect to that practice based on the same set of facts has been filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.], unless the charge is dismissed as being outside the scope of such title. No charge respecting an employment practice may be filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under such title if a charge with respect to such practice based on the same set of facts has been filed under this subsection, unless the charge is dismissed under this section as being outside the scope of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special Counsel</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Appointment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President shall appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, a Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Special Counsel&rdquo;) within the Department of Justice to serve for a term of four years. In the case of a vacancy in the office of the Special Counsel the President may designate the officer or employee who shall act as Special Counsel during such vacancy.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Duties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Special Counsel shall be responsible for investigation of charges and issuance of complaints under this section and in respect of the prosecution of all such complaints before administrative law judges and the exercise of certain functions under subsection (j)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Compensation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Special Counsel is entitled to receive compensation at a rate not to exceed the rate now or hereafter provided for grade GS&ndash;17 of the General Schedule, under section 5332 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Regional offices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Special Counsel, in accordance with regulations of the Attorney General, shall establish such regional offices as may be necessary to carry out his duties.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Investigation of charges</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) By Special Counsel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Special Counsel shall investigate each charge received and, within 120 days of the date of the receipt of the charge, determine whether or not there is reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true and whether or not to bring a complaint with respect to the charge before an administrative law judge. The Special Counsel may, on his own initiative, conduct investigations respecting unfair immigration-related employment practices and, based on such an investigation and subject to paragraph (3), file a complaint before such a judge.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Private actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Special Counsel, after receiving such a charge respecting an unfair immigration-related employment practice which alleges knowing and intentional discriminatory activity or a pattern or practice of discriminatory activity, has not filed a complaint before an administrative law judge with respect to such charge within such 120-day period, the Special Counsel shall notify the person making the charge of the determination not to file such a complaint during such period and the person making the charge may (subject to paragraph (3)) file a complaint directly before such a judge within 90 days after the date of receipt of the notice. The Special Counsel's failure to file such a complaint within such 120-day period shall not affect the right of the Special Counsel to investigate the charge or to bring a complaint before an administrative law judge during such 90-day period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Time limitations on complaints</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No complaint may be filed respecting any unfair immigration-related employment practice occurring more than 180 days prior to the <!-- PDFPage:260 -->date of the filing of the charge with the Special Counsel. This subparagraph shall not prevent the subsequent amending of a charge or complaint under subsection (e)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Hearings</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever a complaint is made that a person or entity has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair immigration-related employment practice, an administrative law judge shall have power to issue and cause to be served upon such person or entity a copy of the complaint and a notice of hearing before the judge at a place therein fixed, not less than five days after the serving of the complaint. Any such complaint may be amended by the judge conducting the hearing, upon the motion of the party filing the complaint, in the judge's discretion at any time prior to the issuance of an order based thereon. The person or entity so complained of shall have the right to file an answer to the original or amended complaint and to appear in person or otherwise and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Judges hearing cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Hearings on complaints under this subsection shall be considered before administrative law judges who are specially designated by the Attorney General as having special training respecting employment discrimination and, to the extent practicable, before such judges who only consider cases under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Complainant as party</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any person filing a charge with the Special Counsel respecting an unfair immigration-related employment practice shall be considered a party to any complaint before an administrative law judge respecting such practice and any subsequent appeal respecting that complaint. In the discretion of the judge conducting the hearing, any other person may be allowed to intervene in the proceeding and to present testimony.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Testimony and authority of hearing officers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Testimony</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The testimony taken by the administrative law judge shall be reduced to writing. Thereafter, the judge, in his discretion, upon notice may provide for the taking of further testimony or hear argument.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Authority of administrative law judges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In conducting investigations and hearings under this subsection&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1324b_1_target" name="1324b_1">1</a></sup> and in accordance with regulations of the Attorney General, the Special Counsel and administrative law judges shall have reasonable access to examine evidence of any person or entity being investigated. The administrative law judges by subpoena may compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence at any designated place or hearing. In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena lawfully issued under this paragraph and upon application of the administrative law judge, an appropriate district court of the United States may issue an order requiring compliance with such subpoena and any failure to obey such order may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Determinations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The administrative law judge shall issue and cause to be served on the parties to the proceeding an order, which shall be final unless appealed as provided under subsection (i) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Orders finding violations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, upon the preponderance of the evidence, an administrative law judge determines that any person or entity named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair immigration-related employment practice, then the judge shall state his findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on such person or entity an order which requires such person or entity to cease and desist from such unfair immigration-related employment practice.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Contents of order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such an order also may require the person or entity&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Treatment of distinct entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In applying this subsection in the case of a person or entity composed of distinct, physically separate subdivisions each of which provides separately for the hiring, recruiting, or referring for employment, without reference to the practices of, and not under the control of or common control with, another subdivision, each such subdivision shall be considered a separate person or entity.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In any complaint respecting an unfair immigration-related employment practice, an administrative law judge, in the judge's discretion, may allow a prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee, if the losing party's argument is without reasonable foundation in law and fact.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Review of final orders</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 60 days after the entry of such final order, any person aggrieved by such final order may seek a review of such order in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the violation is alleged to have occurred or in which the employer resides or transacts business.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Further review</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any judicial proceeding under subsection (i) of this section or this subsection, the court, in its discretion, may allow a prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of costs but only if the losing party's argument is without reasonable foundation in law and fact.</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Powers without warrant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any officer or employee of the Service authorized under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General shall have power without warrant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his right to be or to remain in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to arrest any alien who in his presence or view is entering or attempting to enter the United States in violation of any law or regulation made in pursuance of law regulating the admission, exclusion, expulsion, or removal of aliens, or to arrest any alien in the United States, if he has reason to believe that the alien so arrested is in the United States in violation of any such law or regulation and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest, but the alien arrested shall be taken without unnecessary delay for examination before an officer of the Service having authority to examine aliens as to their right to enter or remain in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) within a reasonable distance from any external boundary of the United States, to board and search for aliens any vessel within the territorial waters of the United States and any railway car, aircraft, conveyance, or vehicle, and within a distance of twenty-five miles from any such external boundary to have access to private lands, but not dwellings, for the purpose of patrolling the border to prevent the illegal entry of aliens into the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to make arrests for felonies which have been committed and which are cognizable under any law of the United States regulating the admission, exclusion, expulsion, or removal of aliens, if he has reason to believe that the person so arrested is guilty of such felony and if there is likelihood of the person escaping before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest, but the person arrested shall be taken without unnecessary delay before the nearest available officer empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the laws of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to make arrests&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for any offense against the United States, if the offense is committed in the officer's or employee's presence, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for any felony cognizable under the laws of the United States, if the officer or employee has reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing such a felony,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">if the officer or employee is performing duties relating to the enforcement of the immigration laws at the time of the arrest and if there is a likelihood of the person escaping before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, an officer or employee of the Service may carry a firearm and may execute and serve any order, warrant, subpoena, summons, or other process issued under the authority of the United States. The authority to make arrests under paragraph (5)(B) shall only be effective on and after the date on which the Attorney General publishes final regulations which (i) prescribe the categories of officers and employees of the Service who may use force (including deadly force) and the circumstances under which such force may be used, (ii) establish standards with respect to enforcement activities of the Service, (iii) require that any officer or employee of the Service is not authorized to make arrests under paragraph (5)(B) unless the officer or employee has received certification as having completed a training program which covers such arrests and standards described in clause (ii), and (iv) establish an expedited, internal review process for violations of such standards, which process is consistent with standard agency procedure regarding confidentiality of matters related to internal investigations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Administration of oath; taking of evidence</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Search without warrant</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Detainer of aliens for violation of controlled substances laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an alien who is arrested by a Federal, State, or local law enforcement official for a violation of any law relating to controlled substances, if the official (or another official)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has reason to believe that the alien may not have been lawfully admitted to the United States or otherwise is not lawfully present in the United States,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) expeditiously informs an appropriate officer or employee of the Service authorized and designated by the Attorney General of the arrest and of facts concerning the status of the alien, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) requests the Service to determine promptly whether or not to issue a detainer to detain the alien,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the officer or employee of the Service shall promptly determine whether or not to issue such a detainer.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Restriction on warrantless entry in case of outdoor agricultural operations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section other than paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of this section, an officer or employee of the Service may not enter without the consent of the owner (or agent thereof) or a properly executed warrant onto the premises of a farm or other outdoor agricultural operation for the purpose of interrogating a person believed to be an alien as to the person's right to be or to remain in the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such fingerprints and photographs shall be made available to Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies, upon request.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Performance of immigration officer functions by State officers and employees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding section 1342 of title 31, the Attorney General may enter into a written agreement with a State, or any political subdivision of a State, pursuant to which an officer or employee of the State or subdivision, who is determined by the Attorney General to be qualified to perform a function of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States (including the transportation of such aliens across State lines to detention centers), may carry out such function at the expense of the State or political subdivision and to the extent consistent with State and local law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An agreement under this subsection shall require that an officer or employee of a State or political subdivision of a State performing a function under the agreement shall have knowledge of, and adhere to, Federal law relating to the function, and shall contain a written certification that the officers or employees performing the function under the agreement have received adequate training regarding the enforcement of relevant Federal immigration laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In performing a function under this subsection, an officer or employee of a State or political subdivision of a State shall be subject to the direction and supervision of the Attorney General.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) With respect to each officer or employee of a State or political subdivision who is authorized to perform a function under this subsection, the specific powers and duties that may be, or are required to be, exercised or performed by the individual, the duration of the authority of the individual, and the position of the agency of the Attorney General who is required to supervise and direct the individual, shall be set forth in a written agreement between the Attorney General and the State or political subdivision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Attorney General may not accept a service under this subsection if the service will be used to displace any Federal employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Except as provided in paragraph (8), an officer or employee of a State or political subdivision of a State performing functions under this subsection shall not be treated as a Federal employee for any purpose other than for purposes of chapter 81 of title 5 (relating to compensation for injury) and sections 2671 through 2680 of title 28 (relating to tort claims).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) An officer or employee of a State or political subdivision of a State acting under color of authority under this subsection, or any agreement entered into under this subsection, shall be considered to be acting under color of Federal <!-- PDFPage:282 -->authority for purposes of determining the liability, and immunity from suit, of the officer or employee in a civil action brought under Federal or State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require any State or political subdivision of a State to enter into an agreement with the Attorney General under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(10) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an agreement under this subsection in order for any officer or employee of a State or political subdivision of a State&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1375. Mail-order bride business</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) There is a substantial &ldquo;mail-order bride&rdquo; business in the United States. With approximately 200 companies in the United States, an estimated 2,000 to 3,500 men in the United States find wives through mail-order bride catalogs each year. However, there are no official statistics available on the number of mail-order brides entering the United States each year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The companies engaged in the mail-order bride business earn substantial profits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Although many of these mail-order marriages work out, in many other cases, anecdotal evidence suggests that mail-order brides find themselves in abusive relationships. There is also evidence to suggest that a substantial number of mail-order marriages are fraudulent under United States law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Many mail-order brides come to the United States unaware or ignorant of United States immigration law. Mail-order brides who are battered often think that if they flee an abusive marriage, they will be deported. Often the citizen spouse threatens to have them deported if they report the abuse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that the rate of marriage fraud between foreign nationals and United States citizens or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence is 8 percent. It is unclear what percentage of these marriage fraud cases originate as mail-order marriages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Information dissemination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each international matchmaking organization doing business in the United States shall disseminate to recruits, upon recruitment, such immigration and naturalization information as the Immigration and Naturalization Service deems appropriate, in the recruit's native language, including information regarding conditional permanent residence status and the battered spouse waiver under such status, permanent resident status, marriage fraud penalties, the unregulated nature of the business engaged in by such organizations, and the study required under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Civil penalty</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any international matchmaking organization that the Attorney General determines has violated this subsection shall be subject, in addition to any other penalties that may be prescribed by law, to a civil money penalty of not more than $20,000 for each such violation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Procedures for imposition of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any penalty under subparagraph (A) may be imposed only after notice and opportunity for an agency hearing on the record in accordance with sections 554 through 557 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General, in consultation with the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization and the Director of the Violence Against Women Initiative of the Department of Justice, shall conduct a study of mail-order marriages to determine, among other things&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the number of such marriages;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the extent of marriage fraud in such marriages, including an estimate of the extent of marriage fraud arising from the services provided by international matchmaking organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the extent to which mail-order spouses utilize section 1254a(a)(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1375_1_target" name="1375_1">1</a></sup> of this title (providing for suspension of deportation in certain cases involving abuse), or section 1154(a)(1)(A)(iii) of this title (providing for certain aliens who have been abused to file a classification petition on their own behalf);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the extent of domestic abuse in mail-order marriages; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the need for continued or expanded regulation and education to implement the objectives of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 and the Immigration Marriage Fraud Amendments of 1986 with respect to mail-order marriages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 1 year after September 30, 1996, the Attorney General shall submit a report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate setting forth the results of the study conducted under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) International matchmaking organization</h4>
