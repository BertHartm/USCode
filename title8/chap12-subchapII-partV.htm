<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), including section 2241 of title 28, or any other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, and except as provided in subparagraph (D), and regardless of whether the judgment, decision, or action is made in removal proceedings, no court shall have jurisdiction to review&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section 1182(h), 1182(i), 1229b, 1229c, or 1255 of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, other than the granting of relief under section 1158(a) of this title.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:280 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Orders against criminal aliens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), including section 2241 of title 28, or any other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, and except as provided in subparagraph (D), no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section 1182(a)(2) or 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D) of this title, or any offense covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) of this title for which both predicate offenses are, without regard to their date of commission, otherwise covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Judicial review of certain legal claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in subparagraph (B) or (C), or in any other provision of this chapter (other than this section) which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of certain decisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No alien shall have a right to appeal from a decision of an immigration judge which is based solely on a certification described in section 1229a(c)(1)(B) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Claims under the United Nations Convention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), including section 2241 of title 28, or any other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of any cause or claim under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, except as provided in subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Exclusive means of review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), including section 2241 of title 28, or any other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal entered or issued under any provision of this chapter, except as provided in subsection (e) of this section. For purposes of this chapter, in every provision that limits or eliminates judicial review or jurisdiction to review, the terms &ldquo;judicial review&rdquo; and &ldquo;jurisdiction to review&rdquo; include habeas corpus review pursuant to section 2241 of title 28, or any other habeas corpus provision, sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, and review pursuant to any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Requirements for review of orders of removal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to review of an order of removal under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the following requirements apply:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Deadline</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The petition for review must be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Venue and forms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The petition for review shall be filed with the court of appeals for the judicial circuit in which the immigration judge completed the proceedings. The record and briefs do not have to be printed. The court of appeals shall review the proceeding on a typewritten record and on typewritten briefs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Service</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The respondent is the Attorney General. The petition shall be served on the Attorney General and on the officer or employee of the Service in charge of the Service district in which the final order of removal under section 1229a of this title was entered.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Stay of order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Service of the petition on the officer or employee does not stay the removal of an alien pending the court's decision on the petition, unless the court orders otherwise.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Alien's brief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The alien shall serve and file a brief in connection with a petition for judicial review not later than 40 days after the date on which the administrative record is available, and may serve and file a reply brief not later than 14 days after service of the brief of the Attorney General, and the court may not extend these deadlines except upon motion for good cause shown. If an alien fails to file a brief within the time provided in this paragraph, the court shall dismiss the appeal unless a manifest injustice would result.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Scope and standard for review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (5)(B)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a decision that an alien is not eligible for admission to the United States is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the Attorney General's discretionary judgment whether to grant relief under section 1158(a) of this title shall be conclusive unless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">No court shall reverse a determination made by a trier of fact with respect to the availability of corroborating evidence, as described in section 1158(b)(1)(B), 1229a(c)(4)(B), or 1231(b)(3)(C) of this title, unless the court finds, pursuant to subsection (b)(4)(B) of this section, that a reasonable trier of fact is compelled to conclude that such corroborating evidence is unavailable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Treatment of nationality claims</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Court determination if no issue of fact</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the petitioner claims to be a national of the United States and the court of appeals <!-- PDFPage:281 -->finds from the pleadings and affidavits that no genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner's nationality is presented, the court shall decide the nationality claim.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Transfer if issue of fact</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the petitioner claims to be a national of the United States and the court of appeals finds that a genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner's nationality is presented, the court shall transfer the proceeding to the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the petitioner resides for a new hearing on the nationality claim and a decision on that claim as if an action had been brought in the district court under section 2201 of title 28.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitation on determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The petitioner may have such nationality claim decided only as provided in this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Consolidation with review of motions to reopen or reconsider</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Challenge to validity of orders in certain criminal proceedings</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the validity of an order of removal has not been judicially decided, a defendant in a criminal proceeding charged with violating section 1253(a) of this title may challenge the validity of the order in the criminal proceeding only by filing a separate motion before trial. The district court, without a jury, shall decide the motion before trial.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Claims of United States nationality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the defendant claims in the motion to be a national of the United States and the district court finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) no genuine issue of material fact about the defendant's nationality is presented, the court shall decide the motion only on the administrative record on which the removal order is based and the administrative findings of fact are conclusive if supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a genuine issue of material fact about the defendant's nationality is presented, the court shall hold a new hearing on the nationality claim and decide that claim as if an action had been brought under section 2201 of title 28.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The defendant may have such nationality claim decided only as provided in this subparagraph.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) does not prevent the Attorney General, after a final order of removal has been issued, from detaining the alien under section 1231(a) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) does not relieve the alien from complying with section 1231(a)(4) of this title and section 1253(g)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1252_1_target" name="1252_1">1</a></sup> of this title; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Consolidation of questions for judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Judicial review of all questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under this section. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no court shall have jurisdiction, by habeas corpus under section 2241 of title 28 or any other habeas corpus provision, by section 1361 or 1651 of such title, or by any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), to review such an order or such questions of law or fact.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requirements for petition</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Review of final orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A court may review a final order of removal only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) another court has not decided the validity of the order, unless the reviewing court finds that the petition presents grounds that could not have been presented in the prior judicial proceeding or that the remedy provided by the prior proceeding was inadequate or ineffective to test the validity of the order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Judicial review of orders under section 1225(b)(1)</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitations on relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Without regard to the nature of the action or claim and without regard to the identity of the party or parties bringing the action, no court may&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) certify a class under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in any action for which judicial review is authorized under a subsequent paragraph of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Habeas corpus proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Judicial review of any determination made under section 1225(b)(1) of this title is available in habeas corpus proceedings, but shall be limited to determinations of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether the petitioner is an alien,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether the petitioner was ordered removed under such section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) whether the petitioner can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the petitioner is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, has been admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of this title, or has been granted asylum under section 1158 of this title, such status not having been terminated, and is entitled to such further inquiry as prescribed by the Attorney General pursuant to section 1225(b)(1)(C) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Challenges on validity of the system</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Judicial review of determinations under section 1225(b) of this title and its implementation is available in an action instituted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, but shall be limited to determinations of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) whether such section, or any regulation issued to implement such section, is constitutional; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) whether such a regulation, or a written policy directive, written policy guideline, or written procedure issued by or under the authority of the Attorney General to implement such section, is not consistent with applicable provisions of this subchapter or is otherwise in violation of law.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Deadlines for bringing actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any action instituted under this paragraph must be filed no later than 60 days after the date the challenged section, regulation, directive, guideline, or procedure described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) is first implemented.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Notice of appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A notice of appeal of an order issued by the District Court under this paragraph may be filed not later than 30 days after the date of issuance of such order.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Expeditious consideration of cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">It shall be the duty of the District Court, the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court of the United States to advance on the docket and to expedite to the greatest possible extent the disposition of any case considered under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case where the court determines that the petitioner&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is an alien who was not ordered removed under section 1225(b)(1) of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the alien is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, has been admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of this title, or has been granted asylum under section 1158 of this title, the court may order no remedy or relief other than to require that the petitioner be provided a hearing in accordance with section 1229a of this title. Any alien who is provided a hearing under section 1229a of this title pursuant to this paragraph may thereafter obtain judicial review of any resulting final order of removal pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Scope of inquiry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining whether an alien has been ordered removed under section 1225(b)(1) of this title, the court's inquiry shall be limited to whether such an order in fact was issued and whether it relates to the petitioner. There shall be no review of whether the alien is actually inadmissible or entitled to any relief from removal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limit on injunctive relief</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Regardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the identity of the party or parties bringing the action, no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of the provisions of part IV of this subchapter, as amended by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, other than with respect to the application of such provisions to an individual alien against whom proceedings under such part have been initiated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Particular cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall enjoin the removal of any alien pursuant to a final order under this section unless the alien shows by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of such order is prohibited as a matter of law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Exclusive jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), including section 2241 of title 28, or any other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Granting of status</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an alien who is a national of a foreign state designated under subsection (b) of this section (or in the case of an alien having no nationality, is a person who last habitually resided in such designated state) and who meets the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, the Attorney General, in accordance with this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may grant the alien temporary protected status in the United States and shall not remove the alien from the United States during the period in which such status is in effect, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall authorize the alien to engage in employment in the United States and provide the alien with an &ldquo;employment authorized&rdquo; endorsement or other appropriate work permit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Duration of work authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Work authorization provided under this section shall be effective throughout the period the alien is in temporary protected status under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Upon the granting of temporary protected status under this section, the Attorney General shall provide the alien with information concerning such status under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If, at the time of initiation of a removal proceeding against an alien, the foreign state (of which the alien is a national) is designated under subsection (b) of this section, the Attorney General shall promptly notify the alien of the temporary protected status that may be available under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) If, at the time of designation of a foreign state under subsection (b) of this section, an alien (who is a national of such state) is in a removal proceeding under this subchapter, the Attorney General shall promptly notify the alien of the temporary protected status that may be available under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Notices under this paragraph shall be provided in a form and language that the alien can understand.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Temporary treatment for eligible aliens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the case of an alien who can establish a prima facie case of eligibility for benefits under paragraph (1), but for the fact that the period of registration under subsection (c)(1)(A)(iv) of this section has not begun, <!-- PDFPage:289 -->until the alien has had a reasonable opportunity to register during the first 30 days of such period, the Attorney General shall provide for the benefits of paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In the case of an alien who establishes a prima facie case of eligibility for benefits under paragraph (1), until a final determination with respect to the alien's eligibility for such benefits under paragraph (1) has been made, the alien shall be provided such benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Clarification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing the Attorney General to deny temporary protected status to an alien based on the alien's immigration status or to require any alien, as a condition of being granted such status, either to relinquish nonimmigrant or other status the alien may have or to execute any waiver of other rights under this chapter. The granting of temporary protected status under this section shall not be considered to be inconsistent with the granting of nonimmigrant status under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Designations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General, after consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government, may designate any foreign state (or any part of such foreign state) under this subsection only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Attorney General finds that there is an ongoing armed conflict within the state and, due to such conflict, requiring the return of aliens who are nationals of that state to that state (or to the part of the state) would pose a serious threat to their personal safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Attorney General finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) there has been an earthquake, flood, drought, epidemic, or other environmental disaster in the state resulting in a substantial, but temporary, disruption of living conditions in the area affected,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the foreign state is unable, temporarily, to handle adequately the return to the state of aliens who are nationals of the state, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the foreign state officially has requested designation under this subparagraph; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Attorney General finds that there exist extraordinary and temporary conditions in the foreign state that prevent aliens who are nationals of the state from returning to the state in safety, unless the Attorney General finds that permitting the aliens to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to the national interest of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A designation of a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) under this paragraph shall not become effective unless notice of the designation (including a statement of the findings under this paragraph and the effective date of the designation) is published in the Federal Register. In such notice, the Attorney General shall also state an estimate of the number of nationals of the foreign state designated who are (or within the effective period of the designation are likely to become) eligible for temporary protected status under this section and their immigration status in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effective period of designation for foreign states</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The designation of a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) under paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) take effect upon the date of publication of the designation under such paragraph, or such later date as the Attorney General may specify in the notice published under such paragraph, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall remain in effect until the effective date of the termination of the designation under paragraph (3)(B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this section, the initial period of designation of a foreign state (or part thereof) under paragraph (1) is the period, specified by the Attorney General, of not less than 6 months and not more than 18 months.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Periodic review, terminations, and extensions of designations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Periodic review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">At least 60 days before end of the initial period of designation, and any extended period of designation, of a foreign state (or part thereof) under this section the Attorney General, after consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government, shall review the conditions in the foreign state (or part of such foreign state) for which a designation is in effect under this subsection and shall determine whether the conditions for such designation under this subsection continue to be met. The Attorney General shall provide on a timely basis for the publication of notice of each such determination (including the basis for the determination, and, in the case of an affirmative determination, the period of extension of designation under subparagraph (C)) in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Termination of designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Attorney General determines under subparagraph (A) that a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) no longer continues to meet the conditions for designation under paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall terminate the designation by publishing notice in the Federal Register of the determination under this subparagraph (including the basis for the determination). Such termination is effective in accordance with subsection (d)(3) of this section, but shall not be effective earlier than 60 days after the date the notice is published or, if later, the expiration of the most recent previous extension under subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Extension of designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Attorney General does not determine under subparagraph (A) that a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) no longer meets the conditions for designation under paragraph (1), the period of designation of the foreign state is extended for an additional period of 6 months (or, in the dis<!-- PDFPage:290 -->cretion of the Attorney General, a period of 12 or 18 months).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Information concerning protected status at time of designations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At the time of a designation of a foreign state under this subsection, the Attorney General shall make available information respecting the temporary protected status made available to aliens who are nationals of such designated foreign state.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Review</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Designations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">There is no judicial review of any determination of the Attorney General with respect to the designation, or termination or extension of a designation, of a foreign state under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Application to individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General shall establish an administrative procedure for the review of the denial of benefits to aliens under this subsection. Such procedure shall not prevent an alien from asserting protection under this section in removal proceedings if the alien demonstrates that the alien is a national of a state designated under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Aliens eligible for temporary protected status</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Nationals of designated foreign states</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to paragraph (3), an alien, who is a national of a state designated under subsection (b)(1) of this section (or in the case of an alien having no nationality, is a person who last habitually resided in such designated state), meets the requirements of this paragraph only if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the alien has continuously resided in the United States since such date as the Attorney General may designate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the alien is admissible as an immigrant, except as otherwise provided under paragraph (2)(A), and is not ineligible for temporary protected status under paragraph (2)(B); and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Registration fee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General may require payment of a reasonable fee as a condition of registering an alien under subparagraph (A)(iv) (including providing an alien with an &ldquo;employment authorized&rdquo; endorsement or other appropriate work permit under this section). The amount of any such fee shall not exceed $50. In the case of aliens registered pursuant to a designation under this section made after July 17, 1991, the Attorney General may impose a separate, additional fee for providing an alien with documentation of work authorization. Notwithstanding section 3302 of title 31, all fees collected under this subparagraph shall be credited to the appropriation to be used in carrying out this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligibility standards</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Waiver of certain grounds for inadmissibility</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) paragraphs (2)(A) and (2)(B) (relating to criminals) of such section,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) paragraph (2)(C) of such section (relating to drug offenses), except for so much of such paragraph as relates to a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) paragraphs (3)(A), (3)(B), (3)(C), and (3)(E) of such section (relating to national security and participation in the Nazi persecutions or those who have engaged in genocide).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Aliens ineligible</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An alien shall not be eligible for temporary protected status under this section if the Attorney General finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the alien has been convicted of any felony or 2 or more misdemeanors committed in the United States, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the alien is described in section 1158(b)(2)(A) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Withdrawal of temporary protected status</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the alien fails, without good cause, to register with the Attorney General annually, at the end of each 12-month period after the granting of such status, in a form and manner specified by the Attorney General.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of brief, casual, and innocent departures and certain other absences</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) For purposes of paragraphs (1)(A)(i) and (3)(B), an alien shall not be considered to have failed to maintain continuous physical pres<!-- PDFPage:291 -->ence in the United States by virtue of brief, casual, and innocent absences from the United States, without regard to whether such absences were authorized by the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of paragraph (1)(A)(ii), an alien shall not be considered to have failed to maintain continuous residence in the United States by reason of a brief, casual, and innocent absence described in subparagraph (A) or due merely to a brief temporary trip abroad required by emergency or extenuating circumstances outside the control of the alien.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing an alien to apply for admission to, or to be admitted to, the United States in order to apply for temporary protected status under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Confidentiality of information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall establish procedures to protect the confidentiality of information provided by aliens under this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Period of validity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (3), such documentation shall be valid during the initial period of designation of the foreign state (or part thereof) involved and any extension of such period. The Attorney General may stagger the periods of validity of the documentation and authorization in order to provide for an orderly renewal of such documentation and authorization and for an orderly transition (under paragraph (3)) upon the termination of a designation of a foreign state (or any part of such foreign state).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effective date of terminations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Attorney General terminates the designation of a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) under subsection (b)(3)(B) of this section, such termination shall only apply to documentation and authorization issued or renewed after the effective date of the publication of notice of the determination under that subsection (or, at the Attorney General's option, after such period after the effective date of the determination as the Attorney General determines to be appropriate in order to provide for an orderly transition).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Detention of alien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An alien provided temporary protected status under this section shall not be detained by the Attorney General on the basis of the alien's immigration status in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Relation of period of temporary protected status to cancellation of removal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to an alien granted temporary protected status under this section, the period of such status shall not be counted as a period of physical presence in the United States for purposes of section 1229b(a) of this title, unless the Attorney General determines that extreme hardship exists. Such period shall not cause a break in the continuity of residence of the period before and after such period for purposes of such section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Benefits and status during period of temporary protected status</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) for purposes of adjustment of status under section 1255 of this title and change of status under section 1258 of this title, the alien shall be considered as being in, and maintaining, lawful status as a nonimmigrant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Exclusive remedy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise specifically provided, this section shall constitute the exclusive authority of the Attorney General under law to permit aliens who are or may become otherwise deportable or have been paroled into the United States to remain in the United States temporarily because of their particular nationality or region of foreign state of nationality.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Limitation on consideration in Senate of legislation adjusting status</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any bill, resolution, or amendment that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provides for adjustment to lawful temporary or permanent resident alien status for any alien receiving temporary protected status under this section, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has the effect of amending this subsection or limiting the application of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Supermajority required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) may be waived or suspended in the Senate only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members duly chosen and sworn.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraphs (1) and (2) are enacted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and as such they are deemed a part of the rules of the Senate, but applicable only with respect to the matters described in paragraph (1) and supersede other rules of the Senate only to the extent that such paragraphs are inconsistent therewith; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:292 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of the Senate to change such rules at any time, in the same manner as in the case of any other rule of the Senate.</p>
