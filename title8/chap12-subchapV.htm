<p class="statutory-body-1em">At any time prior to the conclusion of the removal hearing, either the alien or the Department of Justice may request the judge to issue a subpoena for the presence of a named witness (which subpoena may also command the person to whom it is directed to produce books, papers, documents, or other objects designated therein) upon a satisfactory showing that the presence of the witness is nec<!-- PDFPage:396 -->essary for the determination of any material matter. Such a request may be made ex parte except that the judge shall inform the Department of Justice of any request for a subpoena by the alien for a witness or material if compliance with such a subpoena would reveal classified evidence or the source of that evidence. The Department of Justice shall be given a reasonable opportunity to oppose the issuance of such a subpoena.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Payment for attendance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an application for a subpoena by the alien also makes a showing that the alien is financially unable to pay for the attendance of a witness so requested, the court may order the costs incurred by the process and the fees of the witness so subpoenaed to be paid from funds appropriated for the enforcement of subchapter II of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Nationwide service</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Government is authorized to use in a removal proceedings&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1534_1_target" name="1534_1">1</a></sup> the fruits of electronic surveillance and unconsented physical searches authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) without regard to subsections (c), (e), (f), (g), and (h) of section 106 of that Act [50 U.S.C. 1806(c), (e), (f), (g), (h)] and discovery of information derived pursuant to such Act, or otherwise collected for national security purposes, shall not be authorized if disclosure would present a risk to the national security of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an alien subject to removal under this subchapter shall not be entitled to suppress evidence that the alien alleges was unlawfully obtained; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) section 3504 of title 18 and section 1806(c) of title 50 shall not apply if the Attorney General determines that public disclosure would pose a risk to the national security of the United States because it would disclose classified information or otherwise threaten the integrity of a pending investigation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Protective orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subchapter shall prevent the United States from seeking protective orders and from asserting privileges ordinarily available to the United States to protect against the disclosure of classified information, including the invocation of the military and State secrets privileges.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of classified information</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The judge shall examine, ex parte and in camera, any evidence for which the Attorney General determines that public disclosure would pose a risk to the national security of the United States or to the security of any individual because it would disclose classified information and neither the alien nor the public shall be informed of such evidence or its sources other than through reference to the summary provided pursuant to this paragraph. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Department of Justice may, in its discretion and, in the case of classified information, after coordination with the originating agency, elect to introduce such evidence in open session.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Submission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to such information, the Government shall submit to the removal court an unclassified summary of the specific evidence that does not pose that risk.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 15 days after submission, the judge shall approve the summary if the judge finds that it is sufficient to enable the alien to prepare a defense. The Government shall deliver to the alien a copy of the unclassified summary approved under this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Disapproval</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Revised summary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the revised unclassified summary is not approved by the court within 15 days of its submission pursuant to subparagraph (C), the removal hearing shall be terminated unless the judge makes the findings under clause (iii).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The findings described in this clause are, with respect to an alien, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the continued presence of the alien in the United States would likely cause serious and irreparable harm to the national security or death or serious bodily injury to any person, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the provision of the summary would likely cause serious and irreparable harm to the national security or death or serious bodily injury to any person.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Continuation of hearing without summary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a judge makes the findings described in subparagraph (D)(iii)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if the alien involved is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, <!-- PDFPage:397 -->the procedures described in subparagraph (F) shall apply; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in all cases the special removal hearing shall continue, the Department of Justice shall cause to be delivered to the alien a statement that no summary is possible, and the classified information submitted in camera and ex parte may be used pursuant to this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Special procedures for access and challenges to classified information by special attorneys in case of lawful permanent aliens</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The procedures described in this subparagraph are that the judge (under rules of the removal court) shall designate a special attorney to assist the alien&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) by reviewing in camera the classified information on behalf of the alien, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) by challenging through an in camera proceeding the veracity of the evidence contained in the classified information.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Restrictions on disclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A special attorney receiving classified information under clause (i)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) shall not disclose the information to the alien or to any other attorney representing the alien, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) who discloses such information in violation of subclause (I) shall be subject to a fine under title 18, imprisoned for not less than 10 years nor more than 25 years, or both.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Arguments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Following the receipt of evidence, the Government and the alien shall be given fair opportunity to present argument as to whether the evidence is sufficient to justify the removal of the alien. The Government shall open the argument. The alien shall be permitted to reply. The Government shall then be permitted to reply in rebuttal. The judge may allow any part of the argument that refers to evidence received in camera and ex parte to be heard in camera and ex parte.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Burden of proof</h4>
