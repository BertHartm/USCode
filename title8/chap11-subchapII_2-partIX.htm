<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Powers without warrant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any officer or employee of the Service authorized under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General shall have power without warrant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his right to be or to remain in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to arrest any alien who in his presence or view is entering or attempting to enter the United States in violation of any law or regulation made in pursuance of law regulating the admission, exclusion, or expulsion of aliens, or to arrest any alien in the United States, if he has reason to believe that the alien so arrested is in the United States in violation of any such law or regulation and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest, but the alien arrested shall be taken without unnecessary delay for examination before an officer of the Service having authority to examine aliens as to their right to enter or remain in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) within a reasonable distance from any external boundary of the United States, to board and search for aliens any vessel within the territorial waters of the United States and any railway car, aircraft, conveyance, or vehicle, and within a distance of twenty-five miles from any such external boundary to have access to private lands, but not dwellings, for the purpose of patrolling the border to prevent the illegal entry of aliens into the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to make arrests for felonies which have been committed and which are cognizable under any law of the United States regulating the admission, exclusion, or expulsion of aliens, if he has reason to believe that the person so arrested is guilty of such felony and if there is likelihood of the person escaping before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest, but the person arrested shall be taken without unnecessary delay before the nearest available officer empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the laws of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to make arrests&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for any offense against the United States, if the offense is committed in the officer's or employee's presence, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for any felony cognizable under the laws of the United States, if the officer or employee has reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing such a felony,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">if the officer or employee is performing duties relating to the enforcement of the immigration laws at the time of the arrest and if there is a likelihood of the person escaping before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, an officer or employee of the Service may carry a firearm and may execute and serve any order, warrant, subpoena, summons, or other process issued under the authority of the United States. The authority to make arrests under paragraph (5)(B) shall only be effective on and after the date on which the Attorney General publishes final regulations which (i) prescribe the categories of officers and employees of the Service who may use force (including deadly force) and the circumstances under which such force may be used, (ii) establish standards with respect to enforcement activities of the Service, (iii) require that any officer or employee of the Service is not authorized to make arrests under paragraph (5)(B) unless the officer or employee has received certification as having completed a training program which covers such arrests and standards described in clause (ii), and (iv) establish an expedited, internal review process for violations of such standards, which process is consistent with standard agency procedure regarding confidentiality of matters related to internal investigations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Administration of oath; taking of evidence</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Search without warrant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any officer or employee of the Service authorized and designated under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, whether individually or as one of a class, shall have power to conduct a search, without warrant, of the person, and of the personal effects in the possession of any person seeking admission to the United States, concerning whom such officer or employee may have reasonable cause to suspect that grounds exist for exclusion from the United States under this chapter which would be disclosed by such search.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Detainer of aliens for violation of controlled substances laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an alien who is arrested by a Federal, State, or local law enforcement official for a violation of any law relating to controlled substances, if the official (or another official)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has reason to believe that the alien may not have been lawfully admitted to the United States or otherwise is not lawfully present in the United States,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) expeditiously informs an appropriate officer or employee of the Service authorized and designated by the Attorney General of the arrest and of facts concerning the status of the alien, and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:238 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) requests the Service to determine promptly whether or not to issue a detainer to detain the alien,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the officer or employee of the Service shall promptly determine whether or not to issue such a detainer. If such a detainer is issued and the alien is not otherwise detained by Federal, State, or local officials, the Attorney General shall effectively and expeditiously take custody of the alien.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Restriction on warrantless entry in case of outdoor agricultural operations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section other than paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of this section, an officer or employee of the Service may not enter without the consent of the owner (or agent thereof) or a properly executed warrant onto the premises of a farm or other outdoor agricultural operation for the purpose of interrogating a person believed to be an alien as to the person's right to be or to remain in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Fingerprinting and photographing of certain aliens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Under regulations of the Attorney General, the Commissioner shall provide for the fingerprinting and photographing of each alien 14 years of age or older against whom a proceeding is commenced under section 1252 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such fingerprints and photographs shall be made available to Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies, upon request.</p>
