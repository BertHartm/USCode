<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the number of refugees who may be admitted under this section in fiscal year 1980, 1981, or 1982, may not exceed fifty thousand unless the President determines, before the beginning of the fiscal year and after appropriate consultation (as defined in subsection (e) of this section), that admission of a specific number of refugees in excess of such number is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the number of refugees who may be admitted under this section in any fiscal year after fiscal year 1982 shall be such number as the President determines, before the beginning of the fiscal year and after appropriate consultation, is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Admissions under this subsection shall be allocated among refugees of special humanitarian concern to the United States in accordance with a determination made by the President after appropriate consultation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the determination made under this subsection for each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1992), the President shall enumerate, with the respective number of refugees so determined, the number of aliens who were granted asylum in the previous year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determinations by President respecting number of admissions for humanitarian concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the President determines, after appropriate consultation, that (1) an unforeseen emergency refugee situation exists, (2) the admission of certain refugees in response to the emergency refugee situation is justified by grave humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest, and (3) the admission to the United States of these refugees cannot be accomplished under subsection (a) of this section, the President may fix a number of refugees to be admitted to the United States during the succeeding period (not to exceed twelve months) in response to the emergency refugee situation and such admissions shall be allocated among refugees of special humanitarian concern to the United States in accordance with a determination made by the President after the appropriate consultation provided under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Admission by Attorney General of refugees; criteria; admission status of spouse or child; applicability of other statutory requirements; termination of refugee status of alien, spouse or child</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A spouse or child (as defined in section 1101(b)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) of this title) of any refugee who qualifies for admission under paragraph (1) shall, if not otherwise entitled to admission under paragraph (1) and if not a person described in the second sentence of section 1101(a)(42) of this title, be entitled to the same admission status as such refugee if accompanying, or following to join, such refugee and if the spouse or child is admissible (except as otherwise provided under paragraph (3)) as an immigrant under this chapter. Upon the spouse's or child's admission to the United States, such admission shall be charged against the numerical limitation established in accordance with the appropriate subsection under which the refugee's admission is charged.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An unmarried alien who seeks to accompany, or follow to join, a parent granted admission as a refugee under this subsection, and who was under 21 years of age on the date on which such parent applied for refugee status under this section, shall continue to be classified as a child for purposes of this paragraph, if the alien attained 21 years of age after such application was filed but while it was pending.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to apply for asylum</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any alien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international or United States waters), irrespective of such alien's status, may apply for asylum in accordance with this section or, where applicable, section 1225(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Safe third country</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien if the Attorney General determines that the alien may be removed, pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement, to a country (other than the country of the alien's nationality or, in the case of an alien having no nationality, the country of the alien's last habitual residence) in which the alien's life or freedom would not be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, and where the alien would have access to a full and fair procedure for determining a claim to asylum or equivalent temporary protection, unless the Attorney General finds that it is in the public interest for the alien to receive asylum in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Time limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (D), paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien unless the alien demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien's arrival in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Previous asylum applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (D), paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien if the alien has previously applied for asylum and had such application denied.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Changed circumstances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An application for asylum of an alien may be considered, notwithstanding subparagraphs (B) and (C), if the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant's eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period specified in subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply to an unaccompanied alien child (as defined in section 279(g) of title 6).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitation on judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:110 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions for granting asylum</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General may grant asylum to an alien who has applied for asylum in accordance with the requirements and procedures established by the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General under this section if the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General determines that such alien is a refugee within the meaning of section 1101(a)(42)(A) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Burden of proof</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The burden of proof is on the applicant to establish that the applicant is a refugee, within the meaning of section 1101(a)(42)(A) of this title. To establish that the applicant is a refugee within the meaning of such section, the applicant must establish that race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Sustaining burden</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The testimony of the applicant may be sufficient to sustain the applicant's burden without corroboration, but only if the applicant satisfies the trier of fact that the applicant's testimony is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee. In determining whether the applicant has met the applicant's burden, the trier of fact may weigh the credible testimony along with other evidence of record. Where the trier of fact determines that the applicant should provide evidence that corroborates otherwise credible testimony, such evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not have the evidence and cannot reasonably obtain the evidence.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Credibility determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Considering the totality of the circumstances, and all relevant factors, a trier of fact may base a credibility determination on the demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant or witness, the inherent plausibility of the applicant's or witness's account, the consistency between the applicant's or witness's written and oral statements (whenever made and whether or not under oath, and considering the circumstances under which the statements were made), the internal consistency of each such statement, the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record (including the reports of the Department of State on country conditions), and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant's claim, or any other relevant factor. There is no presumption of credibility, however, if no adverse credibility determination is explicitly made, the applicant or witness shall have a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an alien if the Attorney General determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the alien ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the alien, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) there are serious reasons for believing that the alien has committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside the United States prior to the arrival of the alien in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) there are reasonable grounds for regarding the alien as a danger to the security of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the alien is described in subclause (I), (II), (III), (IV), or (VI) of section 1182(a)(3)(B)(i) of this title or section 1227(a)(4)(B) of this title (relating to terrorist activity), unless, in the case only of an alien described in subclause (IV) of section 1182(a)(3)(B)(i) of this title, the Attorney General determines, in the Attorney General's discretion, that there are not reasonable grounds for regarding the alien as a danger to the security of the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) the alien was firmly resettled in another country prior to arriving in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Conviction of aggravated felony</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (ii) of subparagraph (A), an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony shall be considered to have been convicted of a particularly serious crime.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Offenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Attorney General may designate by regulation offenses that will be considered to be a crime described in clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Additional limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General may by regulation establish additional limitations and conditions, consistent with this section, under which an alien shall be ineligible for asylum under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) No judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">There shall be no judicial review of a determination of the Attorney General under subparagraph (A)(v).</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Lawful residence</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall adjust the status of an alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence if the Attorney General determines that the alien meets the following requirements:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Application period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The alien must apply for such adjustment during the 18-month period beginning on the first day of the seventh month that begins after November 6, 1986.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Performance of seasonal agricultural services and residence in the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The alien must establish that he has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) resided in the United States, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) performed seasonal agricultural services in the United States for at least 90 man-days,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">during the 12-month period ending on May 1, 1986. For purposes of the previous sentence, performance of seasonal agricultural services in the United States for more than one employer on any one day shall be counted as performance of services for only 1 man-day.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Admissible as immigrant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The alien must establish that he is admissible to the United States as an immigrant, except as otherwise provided under subsection (c)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustment to permanent residence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall adjust the status of any alien provided lawful temporary resident status under paragraph (1) to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence on the following date:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Group 1</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the numerical limitation established under subparagraph (C), in the case of an alien who has established, at the time of application for temporary residence under paragraph (1), that the alien performed seasonal agricultural services in the United States for at least 90 man-days during each of the 12-month periods ending on May 1, 1984, 1985, and 1986, the adjustment shall occur on the first day after the end of the one-year period that begins on the later of (I) the date the alien was granted such temporary resident status, or (II) the day after the last day of the application period described in paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Group 2</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of aliens to which subparagraph (A) does not apply, the adjustment shall occur on the day after the last day of the two-year period that begins on the later of (I) the date the alien was granted such temporary resident status, or (II) the day after the last day of the application period described in paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Numerical limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to more than 350,000 aliens. If more than 350,000 aliens meet the requirements of such subparagraph, such subparagraph shall apply to the 350,000 aliens whose applications for adjustment were first filed under paragraph (1) and subparagraph (B) shall apply to the remaining aliens.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Termination of temporary residence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) During the period of temporary resident status granted an alien under paragraph (1), the Attorney General may terminate such status only upon a determination under this chapter that the alien is deportable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Before any alien becomes eligible for adjustment of status under paragraph (2), the Attorney General may deny adjustment to permanent status and provide for termination of the temporary resident status granted such alien under paragraph (1) if&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:116 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the Attorney General finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the adjustment to temporary resident status was the result of fraud or willful misrepresentation as set out in section 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the alien commits an act that (I) makes the alien inadmissible to the United States as an immigrant, except as provided under subsection (c)(2) of this section, or (II) is convicted of a felony or 3 or more misdemeanors committed in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Authorized travel and employment during temporary residence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the period an alien is in lawful temporary resident status granted under this subsection, the alien has the right to travel abroad (including commutation from a residence abroad) and shall be granted authorization to engage in employment in the United States and shall be provided an &ldquo;employment authorized&rdquo; endorsement or other appropriate work permit, in the same manner as for aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, an alien who acquires the status of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence under paragraph (1), such status not having changed, is considered to be an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence (as described in section 1101(a)(20) of this title), other than under any provision of the immigration laws.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Applications for adjustment of status</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) To whom may be made</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Within the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General shall provide that applications for adjustment of status under subsection (a) may be filed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) with the Attorney General, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) with a designated entity (designated under paragraph (2)), but only if the applicant consents to the forwarding of the application to the Attorney General.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Outside the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General, in cooperation with the Secretary of State, shall provide a procedure whereby an alien may apply for adjustment of status under subsection (a)(1) of this section at an appropriate consular office outside the United States. If the alien otherwise qualifies for such adjustment, the Attorney General shall provide such documentation of authorization to enter the United States and to have the alien's status adjusted upon entry as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Designation of entities to receive applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of receiving applications under this section, the Attorney General&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall designate qualified voluntary organizations and other qualified State, local, community, farm labor organizations, and associations of agricultural employers, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may designate such other persons as the Attorney General determines are qualified and have substantial experience, demonstrated competence, and traditional long-term involvement in the preparation and submittal of applications for adjustment of status under section 1159 or 1255 of this title, Public Law 89&ndash;732 [8 U.S.C. 1255 note], or Public Law 95&ndash;145 [8 U.S.C. 1255 note].</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Proof of eligibility</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An alien may establish that he meets the requirement of subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section through government employment records, records supplied by employers or collective bargaining organizations, and such other reliable documentation as the alien may provide. The Attorney General shall establish special procedures to credit properly work in cases in which an alien was employed under an assumed name.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Documentation of work history</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) An alien applying for adjustment of status under subsection (a)(1) of this section has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the alien has worked the requisite number of man-days (as required under subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) If an employer or farm labor contractor employing such an alien has kept proper and adequate records respecting such employment, the alien's burden of proof under clause (i) may be met by securing timely production of those records under regulations to be promulgated by the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) An alien can meet such burden of proof if the alien establishes that the alien has in fact performed the work described in subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section by producing sufficient evidence to show the extent of that employment as a matter of just and reasonable inference. In such a case, the burden then shifts to the Attorney General to disprove the alien's evidence with a showing which negates the reasonableness of the inference to be drawn from the evidence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of applications by designated entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each designated entity must agree to forward to the Attorney General applications filed with it in accordance with paragraph (1)(A)(ii) but not to forward to the Attorney General applications filed with it unless the applicant has consented to such forwarding. No such entity may make a determination required by this section to be made by the Attorney General.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Limitation on access to information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Files and records prepared for purposes of this section by designated entities operating under this section are confidential and the Attorney General and the Service shall not have access to such files or records relating to an alien without the consent of the alien, except as allowed by a court order issued pursuant to paragraph (6) of this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Required disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General shall provide information furnished under this section, and any other information derived from such furnished information, to a duly recognized law enforcement entity in connection with a criminal investigation or prosecution, when such information is requested in writing by such entity, or to an official coroner for purposes of affirmatively identifying a deceased individual (whether or not such individual is deceased as a result of a crime).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Construction</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
