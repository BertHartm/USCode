<p class="statutory-body">(B) It is the intent of Congress that in providing refugee assistance under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) employable refugees should be placed on jobs as soon as possible after their arrival in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) social service funds should be focused on employment-related services, English-as-a-second-language training (in nonwork hours where possible), and case-management services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) local voluntary agency activities should be conducted in close cooperation and advance consultation with State and local governments.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Director and the Federal agency administering subsection (b)(1) of this section shall consult regularly (not less often than quarterly) with State and local governments and private nonprofit voluntary agencies concerning the sponsorship process and the intended distribution of refugees among the States and localities before their placement in those States and localities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Director shall develop and implement, in consultation with representatives of voluntary agencies and State and local governments, policies and strategies for the placement and resettlement of refugees within the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Such policies and strategies, to the extent practicable and except under such unusual circumstances as the Director may recognize, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) insure that a refugee is not initially placed or resettled in an area highly impacted (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Director after consultation with such agencies and governments) by the presence of refugees or comparable populations unless the refugee has a spouse, parent, sibling, son, or daughter residing in that area,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) provide for a mechanism whereby representatives of local affiliates of voluntary agencies regularly (not less often than quarterly) meet with representatives of State and <!-- PDFPage:380 -->local governments to plan and coordinate in advance of their arrival the appropriate placement of refugees among the various States and localities, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) take into account&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Federal administering agency shall use the criteria in the process of awarding or renewing grants and contracts under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Project grants and contracts for services for refugees</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to provide training in English where necessary (regardless of whether the refugees are employed or receiving cash or other assistance); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) to provide where specific needs have been shown and recognized by the Director, health (including mental health) services, social services, educational and other services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The funds available for a fiscal year for grants and contracts under subparagraph (A) shall be allocated among the States based on the total number of refugees (including children and adults) who arrived in the United States not more than 36 months before the beginning of such fiscal year and who are actually residing in each State (taking into account secondary migration) as of the beginning of the fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any limitation which the Director establishes on the proportion of funds allocated to a State under this paragraph that the State may use for services other than those described in subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section shall not apply if the Director receives a plan (established by or in consultation with local governments) and determines that the plan provides for the maximum appropriate provision of employment-related services for, and the maximum placement of, employable refugees consistent with performance standards established under section 106 of the Job Training Partnership Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Director is authorized to make grants to States for assistance to counties and similar areas in the States where, because of factors such as unusually large refugee populations (including secondary migration), high refugee concentrations, and high use of public assistance by refugees, there exists and can be demonstrated a specific need for supplementation of available resources for services to refugees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Grants shall be made available under this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) primarily for the purpose of facilitating refugee employment and achievement of self-sufficiency,</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of Education is authorized to make grants, and enter into contracts, for payments for projects to provide special educational services (including English language training) to refugee children in elementary and secondary schools where a demonstrated need has been shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Director is authorized to provide assistance, reimbursement to States, and grants to and contracts with public and private nonprofit agencies, for the provision of child welfare services, including foster care maintenance payments and services and health care, furnished to any refugee child (except as provided in subparagraph (B)) during the thirty-six month period beginning with the first month in which such refugee child is in the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) In the case of a refugee child who is unaccompanied by a parent or other close adult relative (as defined by the Director), the services described in subparagraph (A) may be fur<!-- PDFPage:383 -->nished until the month after the child attains eighteen years of age (or such higher age as the State's child welfare services plan under part B of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 620 et seq.] prescribes for the availability of such services to any other child in that State).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Director shall attempt to arrange for the placement under the laws of the States of such unaccompanied refugee children, who have been accepted for admission to the United States, before (or as soon as possible after) their arrival in the United States. During any interim period while such a child is in the United States or in transit to the United States but before the child is so placed, the Director shall assume legal responsibility (including financial responsibility) for the child, if necessary, and is authorized to make necessary decisions to provide for the child's immediate care.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) In carrying out the Director's responsibilities under clause (ii), the Director is authorized to enter into contracts with appropriate public or private nonprofit agencies under such conditions as the Director determines to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The Director shall prepare and maintain a list of (I) all such unaccompanied children who have entered the United States after April 1, 1975, (II) the names and last known residences of their parents (if living) at the time of arrival, and (III) the children's location, status, and progress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Cash assistance and medical assistance to refugees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Director is authorized to provide assistance, reimbursement to States, and grants to, and contracts with, public or private nonprofit agencies for 100 per centum of the cash assistance and medical assistance provided to any refugee during the thirty-six month period beginning with the first month in which such refugee has entered the United States and for the identifiable and reasonable administrative costs of providing this assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Cash assistance provided under this subsection to an employable refugee is conditioned, except for good cause shown&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) on the refugee's registration with an appropriate agency providing employment services described in subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) of this section, or, if there is no such agency available, with an appropriate State or local employment service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) on the refugee's participation in any available and appropriate social service or targeted assistance program (funded under subsection (c) of this section) providing job or language training in the area in which the refugee resides; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) on the refugee's acceptance of appropriate offers of employment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Cash assistance shall not be made available to refugees who are full-time students in institutions of higher education (as defined by the Director after consultation with the Secretary of Education).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In the case of a refugee who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) refuses an offer of employment which has been determined to be appropriate either by the agency responsible for the initial resettlement of the refugee under subsection (b) of this section or by the appropriate State or local employment service,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) refuses to go to a job interview which has been arranged through such agency or service, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) refuses to participate in a social service or targeted assistance program referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) which such agency or service determines to be available and appropriate,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">cash assistance to the refugee shall be terminated (after opportunity for an administrative hearing) for a period of three months (for the first such refusal) or for a period of six months (for any subsequent refusal).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Director shall develop plans to provide English training and other appropriate services and training to refugees receiving cash assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If a refugee is eligible for aid or assistance under a State program funded under part A of title IV or under title XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq., 1396 et seq.], or for supplemental security income benefits (including State supplementary payments) under the program established under title XVI of that Act [42 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.], funds authorized under this subsection shall only be used for the non-Federal share of such aid or assistance, or for such supplementary payments, with respect to cash and medical assistance provided with respect to such refugee under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Director is authorized to allow for the provision of medical assistance under paragraph (1) to any refugee, during the one-year period after entry, who does not qualify for assistance under a State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.] on account of any resources or income requirement of such plan, but only if the Director determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) this will (i) encourage economic self-sufficiency, or (ii) avoid a significant burden on State and local governments; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the refugee meets such alternative financial resources and income requirements as the Director shall establish.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) As a condition for receiving assistance, reimbursement, or a contract under this subsection and notwithstanding any other provision of law, a State or agency must provide assurances that whenever a refugee applies for cash or medical assistance for which assistance or reimbursement is provided under this subsection, the State or agency must notify promptly the agency (or local affiliate) which provided for the initial resettlement of the refugee under subsection (b) of this section of the fact that the refugee has so applied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) The Secretary shall develop and implement alternative projects for refugees who have been in the United States less than thirty-six months, under which refugees are provided interim support, medical services, support services, and case management, as needed, in a manner that encourages self-sufficiency, reduces welfare dependency, and fosters greater coordination among the resettlement agencies and service providers. The Secretary may permit al<!-- PDFPage:384 -->ternative projects to cover specific groups of refugees who have been in the United States 36 months or longer if the Secretary determines that refugees in the group have been significantly and disproportionately dependent on welfare and need the services provided under the project in order to become self-sufficient and that their coverage under the projects would be cost-effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Refugees covered under such alternative projects shall be precluded from receiving cash or medical assistance under any other paragraph of this subsection or under title XIX or part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq., 601 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall report to Congress not later than October 31, 1985, on the results of these projects and on any recommendations respecting changes in the refugee assistance program under this section to take into account such results.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) To the extent that the use of such funds is consistent with the purposes of such provisions, funds appropriated under section 1524(a) of this title, part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.], or title XIX of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.], may be used for the purpose of implementing and evaluating alternative projects under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) In its provision of assistance to refugees, a State or political subdivision shall consider the recommendations of, and assistance provided by, agencies with grants or contracts under subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Assistance to States and counties for incarceration of certain Cuban nationals; priority for removal and return to Cuba</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Attorney General shall pay compensation to States and to counties for costs incurred by the States and counties to confine in prisons, during the fiscal year for which such payment is made, nationals of Cuba who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) were paroled into the United States in 1980 by the Attorney General,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) after such parole committed any violation of State or county law for which a term of imprisonment was imposed, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) at the time of such parole and such violation were not aliens lawfully admitted to the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for permanent residence, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) under the terms of an immigrant or a nonimmigrant visa issued,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">under this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the number and names of the Cuban nationals with respect to whom the State or county is entitled to such compensation, and</p>
