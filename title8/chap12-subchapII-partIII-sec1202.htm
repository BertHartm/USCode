<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Immigrant visas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every alien applying for an immigrant visa and for alien registration shall make application therefor in such form and manner and at such place as shall be by regulations prescribed. In the application the alien shall state his full and true name, and any other name which he has used or by which he has been known; age and sex; the date and place of his birth; and such additional information necessary to the identification of the applicant and the enforcement of the immigration and nationality laws as may be by regulations prescribed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Other documentary evidence for immigrant visa</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every alien applying for an immigrant visa shall present a valid unexpired passport or other suitable travel document, or document of identity and nationality, if such document is required under the regulations issued by the Secretary of State. The immigrant shall furnish to <!-- PDFPage:165 -->the consular officer with his application a copy of a certification by the appropriate police authorities stating what their records show concerning the immigrant; a certified copy of any existing prison record, military record, and record of his birth; and a certified copy of all other records or documents concerning him or his case which may be required by the consular officer. The copy of each document so furnished shall be permanently attached to the application and become a part thereof. In the event that the immigrant establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer that any document or record required by this subsection is unobtainable, the consular officer may permit the immigrant to submit in lieu of such document or record other satisfactory evidence of the fact to which such document or record would, if obtainable, pertain.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Nonimmigrant visas; nonimmigrant registration; form, manner and contents of application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every alien applying for a nonimmigrant visa and for alien registration shall make application therefor in such form and manner as shall be by regulations prescribed. In the application the alien shall state his full and true name, the date and place of birth, his nationality, the purpose and length of his intended stay in the United States; his marital status; and such additional information necessary to the identification of the applicant, the determination of his eligibility for a nonimmigrant visa, and the enforcement of the immigration and nationality laws as may be by regulations prescribed. At the discretion of the Secretary of State, application forms for the various classes of nonimmigrant admissions described in section 1101(a)(15) of this title may vary according to the class of visa being requested.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Other documentary evidence for nonimmigrant visa</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Signing and verification of application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as may be otherwise prescribed by regulations, each application for an immigrant visa shall be signed by the applicant in the presence of the consular officer, and verified by the oath of the applicant administered by the consular officer. The application for an immigrant visa, when visaed by the consular officer, shall become the immigrant visa. The application for a nonimmigrant visa or other documentation as a nonimmigrant shall be disposed of as may be by regulations prescribed. The issuance of a nonimmigrant visa shall, except as may be otherwise by regulations prescribed, be evidenced by a stamp, or other&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1202_1_target" name="1202_1">1</a></sup> placed in the alien's passport.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Confidential nature of records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The records of the Department of State and of diplomatic and consular offices of the United States pertaining to the issuance or refusal of visas or permits to enter the United States shall be considered confidential and shall be used only for the formulation, amendment, administration, or enforcement of the immigration, nationality, and other laws of the United States, except that in the discretion of the Secretary of State certified copies of such records may be made available to a court which certifies that the information contained in such records is needed by the court in the interest of the ends of justice in a case pending before the court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Nonimmigrant visa void at conclusion of authorized period of stay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of an alien who has been admitted on the basis of a nonimmigrant visa and remained in the United States beyond the period of stay authorized by the Attorney General, such visa shall be void beginning after the conclusion of such period of stay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An alien described in paragraph (1) shall be ineligible to be readmitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant, except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) on the basis of a visa (other than the visa described in paragraph (1)) issued in a consular office located in the country of the alien's nationality (or, if there is no office in such country, in such other consular office as the Secretary of State shall specify); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) where extraordinary circumstances are found by the Secretary of State to exist.</p>
