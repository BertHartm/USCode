<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1) or a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an application, in the course of which failure or misrepresentation the employer displaced a United States worker employed by the employer within the period beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date of filing of any visa petition supported by the application&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed $35,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to be appropriate; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed an application under this subsection to intimidate, threaten, restrain, coerce, blacklist, discharge, or in any other manner discriminate against an employee (which term, for purposes of this clause, includes a former employee and an applicant for employment) because the employee has disclosed information to the employer, or to any other person, that the employee reasonably believes evidences a violation of this subsection, or any rule or regulation pertaining to this subsection, or because the employee cooperates or seeks to cooperate in an investigation or other proceeding concerning the employer's compliance with the requirements of this subsection or any rule or regulation pertaining to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) The Secretary of Labor and the Attorney General shall devise a process under which an H&ndash;1B nonimmigrant who files a complaint regarding a violation of clause (iv) and is otherwise eligible to remain and work in the United States may be allowed to seek other appropriate employment in the United States for a period not to exceed the maximum period of stay authorized for such nonimmigrant classification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vi)(I) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed an application under this subsection to require an H&ndash;1B nonimmigrant to pay a penalty for ceasing employment with the employer prior to a date agreed to by the nonimmigrant and the employer. The Secretary shall determine whether a required payment is a penalty (and not liquidated damages) pursuant to relevant State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed an application under this subsection to require an alien who is the subject of a petition filed under section 1184(c)(1) of this title, for which a fee is imposed under section 1184(c)(9) of this title, to reimburse, or otherwise compensate, the employer for part or all of the cost of such fee. It is a violation of this clause for such an employer otherwise to accept such reimbursement or compensation from such an alien.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(III) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that an employer has committed a violation of this clause, the Secretary may impose a civil monetary penalty of $1,000 for each such violation and issue an administrative order requiring the return to the nonimmigrant of any amount paid in violation of this clause, or, if the nonimmigrant cannot be located, requiring payment of any such amount to the general fund of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vii)(I) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for an employer, who has filed an application under this subsection and who places an H&ndash;1B nonimmigrant designated as a full-time employee on the petition filed under section 1184(c)(1) of this title by the employer with respect to the nonimmigrant, after the nonimmigrant has entered into employment with the employer, in nonproductive status due to a decision by the employer (based on factors such as lack of work), or due to the nonimmigrant's lack of a permit or license, to fail to pay the nonimmigrant full-time wages in accordance with paragraph (1)(A) for all such nonproductive time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for an employer, who has filed an application under this subsection and who places an H&ndash;1B nonimmigrant designated as a part-time employee on the petition filed under section 1184(c)(1) of this title by the employer with respect to the nonimmigrant, after the nonimmigrant has entered into employment with the employer, in nonproductive status under circumstances described in subclause (I), to fail to pay such a nonimmigrant for such hours as are designated on such petition consistent with the rate of pay identified on such petition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(III) In the case of an H&ndash;1B nonimmigrant who has not yet entered into employment with an employer who has had approved an application under this subsection, and a petition under section 1184(c)(1) of this title, with respect to the <!-- PDFPage:133 -->nonimmigrant, the provisions of subclauses (I) and (II) shall apply to the employer beginning 30 days after the date the nonimmigrant first is admitted into the United States pursuant to the petition, or 60 days after the date the nonimmigrant becomes eligible to work for the employer (in the case of a nonimmigrant who is present in the United States on the date of the approval of the petition).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(IV) This clause does not apply to a failure to pay wages to an H&ndash;1B nonimmigrant for nonproductive time due to non-work-related factors, such as the voluntary request of the nonimmigrant for an absence or circumstances rendering the nonimmigrant unable to work.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(V) This clause shall not be construed as prohibiting an employer that is a school or other educational institution from applying to an H&ndash;1B nonimmigrant an established salary practice of the employer, under which the employer pays to H&ndash;1B nonimmigrants and United States workers in the same occupational classification an annual salary in disbursements over fewer than 12 months, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(aa) the nonimmigrant agrees to the compressed annual salary payments prior to the commencement of the employment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(bb) the application of the salary practice to the nonimmigrant does not otherwise cause the nonimmigrant to violate any condition of the nonimmigrant's authorization under this chapter to remain in the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(VI) This clause shall not be construed as superseding clause (viii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(viii) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for an employer who has filed an application under this subsection to fail to offer to an H&ndash;1B nonimmigrant, during the nonimmigrant's period of authorized employment, benefits and eligibility for benefits (including the opportunity to participate in health, life, disability, and other insurance plans; the opportunity to participate in retirement and savings plans; and cash bonuses and noncash compensation, such as stock options (whether or not based on performance)) on the same basis, and in accordance with the same criteria, as the employer offers to United States workers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that an employer has not paid wages at the wage level specified under the application and required under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall order the employer to provide for payment of such amounts of back pay as may be required to comply with the requirements of paragraph (1), whether or not a penalty under subparagraph (C) has been imposed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) If an H&ndash;1B-dependent employer places a nonexempt H&ndash;1B nonimmigrant with another employer as provided under paragraph (1)(F) and the other employer has displaced or displaces a United States worker employed by such other employer during the period described in such paragraph, such displacement shall be considered for purposes of this paragraph a failure, by the placing employer, to meet a condition specified in an application submitted under paragraph (1); except that the Attorney General may impose a sanction described in subclause (II) of subparagraph (C)(i), (C)(ii), or (C)(iii) only if the Secretary of Labor found that such placing employer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) knew or had reason to know of such displacement at the time of the placement of the nonimmigrant with the other employer; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) has been subject to a sanction under this subparagraph based upon a previous placement of an H&ndash;1B nonimmigrant with the same other employer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(F) The Secretary may, on a case-by-case basis, subject an employer to random investigations for a period of up to 5 years, beginning on the date (on or after October 21, 1998) on which the employer is found by the Secretary to have committed a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1) (or has been found under paragraph (5) to have committed a willful failure to meet the condition of paragraph (1)(G)(i)(II)) or to have made a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an application. The preceding sentence shall apply to an employer regardless of whether or not the employer is an H&ndash;1B-dependent employer.

The investigation may be initiated for reasons other than completeness and obvious inaccuracies by the employer in complying with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the Secretary of Labor receives specific credible information from a source who is likely to have knowledge of an employer's practices or employment conditions, or an employer's compliance with the employer's labor condition application under paragraph (1), and whose identity is known to the Secretary of Labor, and such information provides reasonable cause to believe that the employer has committed a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(C), (1)(E), (1)(F), or (1)(G)(i)(I), has engaged in a pattern or practice of failures to meet such a condition, or has committed a substantial failure to meet such a condition that affects multiple employees, the Secretary of Labor may conduct an investigation into the alleged failure or failures. The Secretary of Labor may withhold the identity of the source from the employer, and the source's identity shall not be subject to disclosure under section 552 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a procedure for any person desiring to provide to the Secretary of Labor information described in clause (ii) that may be used, in whole or in part, as the basis for the commencement of an inves<!-- PDFPage:134 -->tigation described in such clause, to provide the information in writing on a form developed and provided by the Secretary of Labor and completed by or on behalf of the person. The person may not be an officer or employee of the Department of Labor, unless the information satisfies the requirement of clause (iv)(II) (although an officer or employee of the Department of Labor may complete the form on behalf of the person).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) Any investigation initiated or approved by the Secretary of Labor under clause (ii) shall be based on information that satisfies the requirements of such clause and that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) originates from a source other than an officer or employee of the Department of Labor; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(vi) No investigation described in clause (ii) (or hearing described in clause (viii) based on such investigation) may be conducted with respect to information about a failure to meet a condition described in clause (ii), unless the Secretary of Labor receives the information not later than 12 months after the date of the alleged failure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vii) The Secretary of Labor shall provide notice to an employer with respect to whom there is reasonable cause to initiate an investigation described in clauses&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1182_10_target" name="1182_10">10</a></sup> (i) or (ii), prior to the commencement of an investigation under such clauses, of the intent to conduct an investigation. The notice shall be provided in such a manner, and shall contain sufficient detail, to permit the employer to respond to the allegations before an investigation is commenced. The Secretary of Labor is not required to comply with this clause if the Secretary of Labor determines that to do so would interfere with an effort by the Secretary of Labor to secure compliance by the employer with the requirements of this subsection. There shall be no judicial review of a determination by the Secretary of Labor under this clause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(viii) An investigation under clauses&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1182_10_target" name="1182_10">10</a></sup> (i) or (ii) may be conducted for a period of up to 60 days.

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) A person or entity that, in the course of an investigation, is found to have violated the prevailing wage requirements set forth in paragraph (1)(A), shall not be assessed fines or other penalties for such violation if the person or entity can establish that the manner in which the prevailing wage was calculated was consistent with recognized industry standards and practices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) Clauses (i) and (iii) shall not apply to a person or entity that has engaged in or is engaging in a pattern or practice of willful violations of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(I) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as superseding or preempting any other enforcement-related authority under this chapter (such as the authorities under section 1324b of this title), or any other Act.</p>

The procedure and rules of such Service shall be applicable to the selection of such arbitrator and to such arbitration proceedings. The Attorney General shall pay the fee and expenses of the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) The arbitrator shall make findings respecting whether a failure or misrepresentation described in subparagraph (B) occurred.

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process for the receipt, investigation, and disposition of complaints respecting the failure of an employer to meet a condition specified in an attestation submitted under this subsection or misrepresentation by the employer of material facts in such an attestation. Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or organization (including bargaining representatives). No investigation or hearing shall be conducted on a complaint concerning such a failure or misrepresentation unless the complaint was filed not later than 12 months after the date of the failure or misrepresentation, respectively.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed an attestation under this subsection to intimidate, threaten, restrain, coerce, blacklist, discharge, or in any other manner discriminate against an employee (which term, for purposes of this clause, includes a former employee and an applicant for employment) because the employee has disclosed information to the employer, or to any other person, that the employee reasonably believes evidences a violation of this subsection, or any rule or regulation pertaining to this subsection, or because the employee cooperates or seeks to cooperate in an investigation or other proceeding concerning the employer's compliance with the requirements of this subsection or any rule or regulation pertaining to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) The Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall devise a process under which a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title who files a complaint regarding a violation of clause (iv) and is otherwise eligible to remain and work in the United States may be allowed to seek other appropriate employment in the United States for a period not to exceed the maximum period of stay authorized for such nonimmigrant classification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vi)(I) It is a violation of this clause for an employer who has filed an attestation under this subsection to require a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title to pay a penalty for ceasing employment with the employer prior to a date agreed to by the nonimmigrant and the employer. The Secretary of Labor shall determine whether a required payment is a penalty (and not liquidated damages) pursuant to relevant State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that an employer has committed a violation of this clause, the Secretary of Labor may impose a civil monetary penalty of $1,000 for each such violation and issue an administrative order requiring the return to the nonimmigrant of any amount paid in violation of this clause, or, if the nonimmigrant cannot be located, requiring payment of any such amount to the general fund of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vii)(I) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for an employer who has filed an attestation under this subsection and who places a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title designated as a full-time employee in the attestation, after the nonimmigrant has entered into employment with the employer, in nonproductive status due to a decision by the employer (based on factors such as lack of work), or due to the nonimmigrant's lack of a permit or license, to fail to pay the nonimmigrant full-time wages in accordance with paragraph (1)(A) for all such nonproductive time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for an employer who has filed an attestation under this subsection and who places a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title designated as a part-time employee in the attestation, after the nonimmigrant has entered into employment with the employer, in nonproductive status under circumstances described in subclause (I), to fail to pay such a nonimmigrant for such hours as are designated on the attestation consistent with the rate of pay identified on the attestation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(III) In the case of a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title who has not yet entered into employment with an employer <!-- PDFPage:139 -->who has had approved an attestation under this subsection with respect to the nonimmigrant, the provisions of subclauses (I) and (II) shall apply to the employer beginning 30 days after the date the nonimmigrant first is admitted into the United States, or 60 days after the date the nonimmigrant becomes eligible to work for the employer in the case of a nonimmigrant who is present in the United States on the date of the approval of the attestation filed with the Secretary of Labor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(IV) This clause does not apply to a failure to pay wages to a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title for nonproductive time due to non-work-related factors, such as the voluntary request of the nonimmigrant for an absence or circumstances rendering the nonimmigrant unable to work.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(V) This clause shall not be construed as prohibiting an employer that is a school or other educational institution from applying to a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title an established salary practice of the employer, under which the employer pays to nonimmigrants under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title and United States workers in the same occupational classification an annual salary in disbursements over fewer than 12 months, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(aa) the nonimmigrant agrees to the compressed annual salary payments prior to the commencement of the employment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(bb) the application of the salary practice to the nonimmigrant does not otherwise cause the nonimmigrant to violate any condition of the nonimmigrant's authorization under this chapter to remain in the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(VI) This clause shall not be construed as superseding clause (viii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(viii) It is a failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A) for an employer who has filed an attestation under this subsection to fail to offer to a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title, during the nonimmigrant's period of authorized employment, benefits and eligibility for benefits (including the opportunity to participate in health, life, disability, and other insurance plans; the opportunity to participate in retirement and savings plans; and cash bonuses and non-cash compensation, such as stock options (whether or not based on performance)) on the same basis, and in accordance with the same criteria, as the employer offers to United States workers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that an employer has not paid wages at the wage level specified in the attestation and required under paragraph (1), the Secretary of Labor shall order the employer to provide for payment of such amounts of back pay as may be required to comply with the requirements of paragraph (1), whether or not a penalty under subparagraph (C) has been imposed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) The Secretary of Labor may, on a case-by-case basis, subject an employer to random investigations for a period of up to 5 years, beginning on the date on which the employer is found by the Secretary of Labor to have committed a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1) or to have made a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an attestation. The authority of the Secretary of Labor under this subparagraph shall not be construed to be subject to, or limited by, the requirements of subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as superseding or preempting any other enforcement-related authority under this chapter (such as the authorities under section 1324b of this title), or any other Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this subsection:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;area of employment&rdquo; means the area within normal commuting distance of the worksite or physical location where the work of the nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title is or will be performed. If such worksite or location is within a Metropolitan Statistical Area, any place within such area is deemed to be within the area of employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In the case of an attestation with respect to one or more nonimmigrants under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title by an employer, the employer is considered to &ldquo;displace&rdquo; a United States worker from a job if the employer lays off the worker from a job that is essentially the equivalent of the job for which the nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or are sought. A job shall not be considered to be essentially equivalent of another job unless it involves essentially the same responsibilities, was held by a United States worker with substantially equivalent qualifications and experience, and is located in the same area of employment as the other job.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) The term &ldquo;lays off&rdquo;, with respect to a worker&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) means to cause the worker's loss of employment, other than through a discharge for inadequate performance, violation of workplace rules, cause, voluntary departure, voluntary retirement, or the expiration of a grant or contract; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) does not include any situation in which the worker is offered, as an alternative to such loss of employment, a similar employment opportunity with the same employer at equivalent or higher compensation and benefits than the position from which the employee was discharged, regardless of whether or not the employee accepts the offer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Nothing in this subparagraph is intended to limit an employee's rights under a collective bargaining agreement or other employment contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The term &ldquo;United States worker&rdquo; means an employee who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is a citizen or national of the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) is an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence, is admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of this title, is granted asylum under section 1158 of this title, or is an immigrant otherwise authorized, by this chapter or by the Secretary of Homeland Security, to be employed.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:140 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(t)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1182_12_target" name="1182_12">12</a></sup> Foreign residence requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no person admitted under section 1101(a)(15)(Q)(ii)(I) of this title, or acquiring such status after admission, shall be eligible to apply for nonimmigrant status, an immigrant visa, or permanent residence under this chapter until it is established that such person has resided and been physically present in the person's country of nationality or last residence for an aggregate of at least 2 years following departure from the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Homeland Security may waive the requirement of such 2-year foreign residence abroad if the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) departure from the United States would impose exceptional hardship upon the alien's spouse or child (if such spouse or child is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the admission of the alien is in the public interest or the national interest of the United States.</p>

<p class="note-body">Proc. No. 4865, Sept. 29, 1981, 46 F.R. 48107, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">The ongoing migration of persons to the United States in violation of our laws is a serious national problem detrimental to the interests of the United States. A particularly difficult aspect of the problem is the continuing illegal migration by sea of large numbers of undocumented aliens into the southeastern United States. These arrivals have severely strained the law enforcement resources of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and have threatened the welfare and safety of communities in that region.</p>
<p class="note-body">As a result of our discussions with the Governments of affected foreign countries and with agencies of the Executive Branch of our Government, I have determined that new and effective measures to curtail these unlawful arrivals are necessary. In this regard, I have determined that international cooperation to intercept vessels trafficking in illegal migrants is a necessary and proper means of insuring the effective enforcement of our laws.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including Sections 212(f) and 215(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a)(1)), in order to protect the sovereignty of the United States, and in accordance with cooperative arrangements with certain foreign governments, and having found that the entry of undocumented aliens, arriving at the borders of the United States from the high seas, is detrimental to the interests of the United States, do proclaim that:</p>

No alien admitted to Guam without a visa pursuant to section 1182(<em>l</em>) of this title may be authorized to enter or stay in the United States other than in Guam or to remain in Guam for a period exceeding fifteen days from date of admission to Guam. No alien admitted to the United States without a visa pursuant to section 1187 of this title may be authorized to remain in the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor for a period exceeding 90 days from the date of admission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The period of authorized status as a nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(O) of this title shall be for such period as the Attorney General may specify in order to provide for the event (or events) for which the nonimmigrant is admitted.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Presumption of status; written waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every alien (other than a nonimmigrant described in subparagraph (L) or (V) of section 1101(a)(15) of this title, and other than a nonimmigrant described in any provision of section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i) of this title except subclause (b1) of such section) shall be presumed to be an immigrant until he establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer, at the time of application for a visa, and the immigration officers, at the time of application for admission, that he is entitled to a nonimmigrant status under section 1101(a)(15) of this title. An alien who is an officer or employee of any foreign government or of any international organization entitled to enjoy privileges, exemptions, and immunities under the International Organizations Immunities Act [22 U.S.C. 288 et seq.], or an alien who is the attendant, servant, employee, or member of the immediate family of any such alien shall not be entitled to apply for or receive an immigrant visa, or to enter the United States as an immigrant unless he executes a written waiver in the same form and substance as is prescribed by section 1257(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Petition of importing employer; involvement of Departments of Labor and Agriculture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The question of importing any alien as a nonimmigrant under subparagraph (H), (L), (O), or (P)(i) of section 1101(a)(15) of this title (excluding nonimmigrants under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title) in any specific case or specific cases shall be determined by the Attorney General, after consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government, upon petition of the importing employer. Such petition, <!-- PDFPage:166 -->shall be made and approved before the visa is granted. The petition shall be in such form and contain such information as the Attorney General shall prescribe. The approval of such a petition shall not, of itself, be construed as establishing that the alien is a nonimmigrant. For purposes of this subsection with respect to nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of this title, the term &ldquo;appropriate agencies of Government&rdquo; means the Department of Labor and includes the Department of Agriculture. The provisions of section 1188 of this title shall apply to the question of importing any alien as a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Attorney General shall provide for a procedure under which an importing employer which meets requirements established by the Attorney General may file a blanket petition to import aliens as nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title instead of filing individual petitions under paragraph (1) to import such aliens. Such procedure shall permit the expedited processing of visas for admission of aliens covered under such a petition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title, an alien is considered to be serving in a capacity involving specialized knowledge with respect to a company if the alien has a special knowledge of the company product and its application in international markets or has an advanced level of knowledge of processes and procedures of the company.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(E) In the case of an alien spouse admitted under section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title, who is accompanying or following to join a principal alien admitted under such section, the Attorney General shall authorize the alien spouse to engage in employment in the United States and provide the spouse with an &ldquo;employment authorized&rdquo; endorsement or other appropriate work permit.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the alien will be controlled and supervised principally by such unaffiliated employer; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the placement of the alien at the worksite of the unaffiliated employer is essentially an arrangement to provide labor for hire for the unaffiliated employer, rather than a placement in connection with the provision of a product or service for which specialized knowledge specific to the petitioning employer is necessary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Attorney General shall approve a petition&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conditions for approval of H&ndash;2A petitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A petition to import an alien as an H&ndash;2A worker (as defined in subsection (i)(2) of this section) may not be approved by the Attorney General unless the petitioner has applied to the Secretary of Labor for a certification that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there are not sufficient workers who are able, willing, and qualified, and who will be available at the time and place needed, to perform the labor or services involved in the petition, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the employment of the alien in such labor or services will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Labor may require by regulation, as a condition of issuing the certification, the payment of a fee to recover the reasonable costs of processing applications for certification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions for denial of labor certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Labor may not issue a certification under subsection (a) of this section with respect to an employer if the conditions described in that subsection are not met or if any of the following conditions are met:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) There is a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute which, under the regulations, precludes such certification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) The employer during the previous two-year period employed H&ndash;2A workers and the Secretary of Labor has determined, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that the employer at any time during that period substantially violated a material term or condition of the labor certification with respect to the employment of domestic or nonimmigrant workers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) No employer may be denied certification under subparagraph (A) for more than three years for any violation described in such subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The employer has not provided the Secretary with satisfactory assurances that if the employment for which the certification is sought is not covered by State workers&rsquo; compensation law, the employer will provide, at no cost to the worker, insurance covering injury and disease arising out of and in the course of the worker's employment which will provide benefits at least equal to those provided under the State workers&rsquo; compensation law for comparable employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Secretary determines that the employer has not made positive recruitment efforts within a multi-state region of traditional or expected labor supply where the Secretary finds that there are a significant number of qualified United States workers who, if recruited, would be willing to make themselves available for work at the time and place needed. Positive recruitment under this paragraph is in addition to, and shall be conducted within the same time period as, the circulation through the interstate employment service system of the employer's job offer. The obligation to engage in positive recruitment under this paragraph shall terminate on the date the H&ndash;2A workers depart for the employer's place of employment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rules for consideration of applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The following rules shall apply in the case of the filing and consideration of an application for a labor certification under this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Deadline for filing applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of Labor may not require that the application be filed more than 45 days before the first date the employer requires the labor or services of the H&ndash;2A worker.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice within seven days of deficiencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The employer shall be notified in writing within seven days of the date of filing if the application does not meet the standards (other than that described in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section) for approval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the application does not meet such standards, the notice shall include the reasons therefor and the Secretary shall provide an opportunity for the prompt resubmission of a modified application.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Issuance of certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary of Labor shall make, not later than 30 days before the date such labor or services are first required to be performed, the certification described in subsection (a)(1) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the employer has complied with the criteria for certification (including criteria for the recruitment of eligible individuals as prescribed by the Secretary), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the employer does not actually have, or has not been provided with referrals of, qualified eligible individuals who have indi<!-- PDFPage:202 -->cated their availability to perform such labor or services on the terms and conditions of a job offer which meets the requirements of the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In considering the question of whether a specific qualification is appropriate in a job offer, the Secretary shall apply the normal and accepted qualifications required by non-H&ndash;2A-employers in the same or comparable occupations and crops.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) For a period of 3 years subsequent to the effective date of this section, labor certifications shall remain effective only if, from the time the foreign worker departs for the employer's place of employment, the employer will provide employment to any qualified United States worker who applies to the employer until 50 percent of the period of the work contract, under which the foreign worker who is in the job was hired, has elapsed. In addition, the employer will offer to provide benefits, wages and working conditions required pursuant to this section and regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The requirement of clause (i) shall not apply to any employer who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) did not, during any calendar quarter during the preceding calendar year, use more than 500 man-days of agricultural labor, as defined in section 203(u) of title 29,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) is not a member of an association which has petitioned for certification under this section for its members, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) has not otherwise associated with other employers who are petitioning for temporary foreign workers under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Six months before the end of the 3-year period described in clause (i), the Secretary of Labor shall consider the findings of the report mandated by section 403(a)(4)(D) of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 as well as other relevant materials, including evidence of benefits to United States workers and costs to employers, addressing the advisability of continuing a policy which requires an employer, as a condition for certification under this section, to continue to accept qualified, eligible United States workers for employment after the date the H&ndash;2A workers depart for work with the employer. The Secretary's review of such findings and materials shall lead to the issuance of findings in furtherance of the Congressional policy that aliens not be admitted under this section unless there are not sufficient workers in the United States who are able, willing, and qualified to perform the labor or service needed and that the employment of the aliens in such labor or services will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed. In the absence of the enactment of Federal legislation prior to three months before the end of the 3-year period described in clause (i) which addresses the subject matter of this subparagraph, the Secretary shall immediately publish the findings required by this clause, and shall promulgate, on an interim or final basis, regulations based on his findings which shall be effective no later than three years from the effective date of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) In complying with clause (i) of this subparagraph, an association shall be allowed to refer or transfer workers among its members: <em>Provided</em>, That for purposes of this section an association acting as an agent for its members shall not be considered a joint employer merely because of such referral or transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) United States workers referred or transferred pursuant to clause (iv) of this subparagraph shall not be treated disparately.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) An employer shall not be liable for payments under section 655.202(b)(6) of title 20, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation) with respect to an H&ndash;2A worker who is displaced due to compliance with the requirement of this subparagraph, if the Secretary of Labor certifies that the H&ndash;2A worker was displaced because of the employer's compliance with clause (i) of this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii)(I) No person or entity shall willfully and knowingly withhold domestic workers prior to the arrival of H&ndash;2A workers in order to force the hiring of domestic workers under clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) Upon the receipt of a complaint by an employer that a violation of subclause (I) has occurred the Secretary shall immediately investigate. He shall within 36 hours of the receipt of the complaint issue findings concerning the alleged violation. Where the Secretary finds that a violation has occurred, he shall immediately suspend the application of clause (i) of this subparagraph with respect to that certification for that date of need.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Employers shall furnish housing in accordance with regulations. The employer shall be permitted at the employer's option to provide housing meeting applicable Federal standards for temporary labor camps or to secure housing which meets the local standards for rental and/or public accommodations or other substantially similar class of habitation: <em>Provided</em>, That in the absence of applicable local standards, State standards for rental and/or public accommodations or other substantially similar class of habitation shall be met: <em>Provided further</em>, That in the absence of applicable local or State standards, Federal temporary labor camp standards shall apply: <em>Provided further</em>, That the Secretary of Labor shall issue regulations which address the specific requirements of housing for employees principally engaged in the range production of livestock: <em>Provided further</em>, That when it is the prevailing practice in the area and occupation of intended employment to provide family housing, family housing shall be provided to workers with families who request it: <em>And provided further</em>, That nothing in this paragraph shall require an employer to provide or secure housing for workers who are not entitled to it under the temporary labor certification regulations in effect on June 1, 1986. The determination as to whether the housing furnished by an employer for an H&ndash;2A worker meets the requirements imposed by this paragraph must be made prior to the date specified in paragraph (3)(A) by which the Secretary of Labor is required to make a certification described <!-- PDFPage:203 -->in subsection (a)(1) of this section with respect to a petition for the importation of such worker.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Roles of agricultural associations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Permitting filing by agricultural associations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A petition to import an alien as a temporary agricultural worker, and an application for a labor certification with respect to such a worker, may be filed by an association of agricultural producers which use agricultural services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of associations acting as employers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an association is a joint or sole employer of temporary agricultural workers, the certifications granted under this section to the association may be used for the certified job opportunities of any of its producer members and such workers may be transferred among its producer members to perform agricultural services of a temporary or seasonal nature for which the certifications were granted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of violations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Member's violation does not necessarily disqualify association or other members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an individual producer member of a joint employer association is determined to have committed an act that under subsection (b)(2) of this section results in the denial of certification with respect to the member, the denial shall apply only to that member of the association unless the Secretary determines that the association or other member participated in, had knowledge of, or reason to know of, the violation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Association's violation does not necessarily disqualify members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) If an association representing agricultural producers as a joint employer is determined to have committed an act that under subsection (b)(2) of this section results in the denial of certification with respect to the association, the denial shall apply only to the association and does not apply to any individual producer member of the association unless the Secretary determines that the member participated in, had knowledge of, or reason to know of, the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) If an association of agricultural producers certified as a sole employer is determined to have committed an act that under subsection (b)(2) of this section results in the denial of certification with respect to the association, no individual producer member of such association may be the beneficiary of the services of temporary alien agricultural workers admitted under this section in the commodity and occupation in which such aliens were employed by the association which was denied certification during the period such denial is in force, unless such producer member employs such aliens in the commodity and occupation in question directly or through an association which is a joint employer of such workers with the producer member.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Expedited administrative appeals of certain determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Regulations shall provide for an expedited procedure for the review of a denial of certification under subsection (a)(1) of this section or a revocation of such a certification or, at the applicant's request, for a de novo administrative hearing respecting the denial or revocation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Labor shall expeditiously, but in no case later than 72 hours after the time a new determination is requested, make a new determination on the request for certification in the case of an H&ndash;2A worker if able, willing, and qualified eligible individuals are not actually available at the time such labor or services are required and a certification was denied in whole or in part because of the availability of qualified workers. If the employer asserts that any eligible individual who has been referred is not able, willing, or qualified, the burden of proof is on the employer to establish that the individual referred is not able, willing, or qualified because of employment-related reasons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Violators disqualified for 5 years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An alien may not be admitted to the United States as a temporary agricultural worker if the alien was admitted to the United States as such a worker within the previous five-year period and the alien during that period violated a term or condition of such previous admission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year, beginning with fiscal year 1987, $10,000,000 for the purposes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) of recruiting domestic workers for temporary labor and services which might otherwise be performed by nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) of monitoring terms and conditions under which such nonimmigrants (and domestic workers employed by the same employers) are employed in the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Labor is authorized to take such actions, including imposing appropriate penalties and seeking appropriate injunctive relief and specific performance of contractual obligations, as may be necessary to assure employer compliance with terms and conditions of employment under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) There are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year, beginning with fiscal year 1987, such sums as may be necessary for the purpose of enabling the Secretary of Labor to make determinations and certifications under this section and under section 1182(a)(5)(A)(i) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) There are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year, beginning with fiscal year 1987, such sums as may be necessary for the purposes of enabling the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out the Secretary's duties and responsibilities under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Miscellaneous provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Attorney General shall provide for such endorsement of entry and exit documents of nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii) of this title as may be necessary to carry out this section and to provide notice for purposes of section 1324a of this title.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:204 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of section 1184 of this title and the provisions of this section preempt any State or local law regulating admissibility of nonimmigrant workers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;eligible individual&rdquo; means, with respect to employment, an individual who is not an unauthorized alien (as defined in section 1324a(h)(3) of this title) with respect to that employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;H&ndash;2A worker&rdquo; means a nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of this title.</p>
