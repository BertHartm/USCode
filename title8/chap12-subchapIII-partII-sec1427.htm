<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Absences</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Absence from the United States of more than six months but less than one year during the period for which continuous residence is required for admission to citizenship, immediately preceding the date of filing the application for naturalization, or during the period between the date of filing the application and the date of any hearing under section 1447(a) of this title, shall break the continuity of such residence, unless the applicant shall establish to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that he did not in fact <!-- PDFPage:310 -->abandon his residence in the United States during such period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Absence from the United States for a continuous period of one year or more during the period for which continuous residence is required for admission to citizenship (whether preceding or subsequent to the filing of the application for naturalization) shall break the continuity of such residence, except that in the case of a person who has been physically present and residing in the United States, after being lawfully admitted for permanent residence, for an uninterrupted period of at least one year, and who thereafter is employed by or under contract with the Government of the United States or an American institution of research recognized as such by the Attorney General, or is employed by an American firm or corporation engaged in whole or in part in the development of foreign trade and commerce of the United States, or a subsidiary thereof more than 50 per centum of whose stock is owned by an American firm or corporation, or is employed by a public international organization of which the United States is a member by treaty or statute and by which the alien was not employed until after being lawfully admitted for permanent residence, no period of absence from the United States shall break the continuity of residence if&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Physical presence</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Persons making extraordinary contributions to national security</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the Director of Central Intelligence, the Attorney General and the Commissioner of Immigration determine that an applicant otherwise eligible for naturalization has made an extraordinary contribution to the national security of the United States or to the conduct of United States intelligence activities, the applicant may be naturalized without regard to the residence and physical presence requirements of this section, or to the prohibitions of section 1424 of this title, and no residence within a particular State or district of the Service in the United States shall be required: <em>Provided</em>, That the applicant has continuously resided in the United States for at least one year prior to naturalization: <em>Provided further</em>, That the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any alien described in clauses (i) through (v) of section 1158(b)(2)(A) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An applicant for naturalization under this subsection may be administered the oath of allegiance under section 1448(a) of this title by any district court of the United States, without regard to the residence of the applicant.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The number of aliens naturalized pursuant to this subsection in any fiscal year shall not exceed five. The Director of Central Intelligence shall inform the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives within a reasonable time prior to the filing of each application under the provisions of this subsection.</p>
