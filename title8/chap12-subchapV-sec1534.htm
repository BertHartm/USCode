<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which an application for an order is approved under section 1533(c)(2) of this title, a removal hearing shall be conducted under this section as expeditiously as practicable for the purpose of determining whether the alien to whom the order pertains should be removed from the United States on the grounds that the alien is an alien terrorist.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Public hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The removal hearing shall be open to the public.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:370 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notice</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Right of counsel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The alien shall have a right to be present at such hearing and to be represented by counsel.

Such counsel shall be appointed by the judge pursuant to the plan for furnishing representation for any person financially unable to obtain adequate representation for the district in which the hearing is conducted, as provided for in section 3006A of title 18. All provisions of that section shall apply and, for purposes of determining the maximum amount of compensation, the matter shall be treated as if a felony was charged.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Introduction of evidence</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Subpoenas</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Request</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At any time prior to the conclusion of the removal hearing, either the alien or the Department of Justice may request the judge to issue a subpoena for the presence of a named witness (which subpoena may also command the person to whom it is directed to produce books, papers, documents, or other objects designated therein) upon a satisfactory showing that the presence of the witness is necessary for the determination of any material matter. Such a request may be made ex parte except that the judge shall inform the Department of Justice of any request for a subpoena by the alien for a witness or material if compliance with such a subpoena would reveal classified evidence or the source of that evidence. The Department of Justice shall be given a reasonable opportunity to oppose the issuance of such a subpoena.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Payment for attendance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an application for a subpoena by the alien also makes a showing that the alien is financially unable to pay for the attendance of a witness so requested, the court may order the costs incurred by the process and the fees of the witness so subpoenaed to be paid from funds appropriated for the enforcement of subchapter II of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Nationwide service</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) section 3504 of title 18 and section 1806(c) of title 50 shall not apply if the Attorney General determines that public disclosure would pose a risk to the national security of the United States because it would disclose classified information or otherwise threaten the integrity of a pending investigation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Protective orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subchapter shall prevent the United States from seeking protective orders and from asserting privileges ordinarily available to the United States to protect against the disclosure of classified information, including the invocation of the military and State secrets privileges.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of classified information</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The judge shall examine, ex parte and in camera, any evidence for which the Attorney General determines that public disclosure would pose a risk to the national security of the United States or to the security <!-- PDFPage:371 -->of any individual because it would disclose classified information and neither the alien nor the public shall be informed of such evidence or its sources other than through reference to the summary provided pursuant to this paragraph.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 15 days after submission, the judge shall approve the summary if the judge finds that it is sufficient to enable the alien to prepare a defense. The Government shall deliver to the alien a copy of the unclassified summary approved under this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Disapproval</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Revised summary</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Continuation of hearing without summary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a judge makes the findings described in subparagraph (D)(iii)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if the alien involved is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, the procedures described in subparagraph (F) shall apply; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in all cases the special removal hearing shall continue, the Department of Justice shall cause to be delivered to the alien a statement that no summary is possible, and the classified information submitted in camera and ex parte may be used pursuant to this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">A special attorney receiving classified information under clause (i)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) shall not disclose the information to the alien or to any other attorney representing the alien, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) who discloses such information in violation of subclause (I) shall be subject to a fine under title 18, imprisoned for not less than 10 years nor more than 25 years, or both.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Arguments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Following the receipt of evidence, the Government and the alien shall be given fair opportunity to present argument as to whether the evidence is sufficient to justify the removal of the alien. The Government shall open the argument. The alien shall be permitted to reply. The Government shall then be permitted to reply in rebuttal. The judge may allow any part of the argument that refers to evidence received in camera and ex parte to be heard in camera and ex parte.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the hearing, it is the Government's burden to prove, by the preponderance of the evidence, that the alien is subject to removal because the alien is an alien terrorist.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Rules of evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Rules of Evidence shall not apply in a removal hearing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Determination of deportation</h4>

Any portion of the order that would reveal the substance or source of information received in camera and ex parte pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall not be made available to the alien or the public.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:372 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(k) No right to ancillary relief</h4>
