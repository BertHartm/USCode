<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Authority</h4>

No absence or portion of an absence connected to the battering or extreme cruelty shall count toward the 90-day or 180-day limits established in subsection (d)(2) of this section. If any absence or aggregate absences exceed 180 days, the absences or portions of the absences will not be considered to break the period of continuous presence. Any such period of time excluded from the 180-day limit shall be excluded in computing the time during which the alien has been physically present for purposes of the 3-year requirement set forth in this subparagraph, subparagraph (A)(ii), and section 1254(a)(3) of this title (as in effect before the title III&ndash;A effective date in section 309 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Good moral character</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding section 1101(f) of this title, an act or conviction that does not bar the Attorney General from granting relief under this paragraph by reason of subparagraph (A)(iv) shall not bar the Attorney General from finding the alien to be of good moral character under subparagraph (A)(iii) or section 1254(a)(3) of this title (as in effect before the title III&ndash;A effective date in section 309 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996), if the Attorney General finds that the act or conviction was connected to the alien's having been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty and determines that a waiver is otherwise warranted.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Credible evidence considered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In acting on applications under this paragraph, the Attorney General shall consider any credible evidence relevant to the application. The determination of what evidence is credible and the weight to be given that evidence shall be within the sole discretion of the Attorney General.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Recordation of date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to aliens who the Attorney General adjusts to the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence under paragraph (1) or (2), the Attorney General shall record the alien's lawful admission for permanent residence as of the date of the Attorney General's cancellation of removal under paragraph (1) or (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Children of battered aliens and parents of battered alien children</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

Applications for adjustment of status filed by aliens covered under this paragraph shall be treated as if they were applications filed under section 1154(a)(1)(A)(iii), (A)(iv), (B)(ii), or (B)(iii) of this title for purposes of section 1255 (a) and (c) of this title. Failure by the alien granted relief under subsection (b)(2) of this section or section 1254(a)(3) of this title (as in effect before the title III&ndash;A effective date in section 309 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996) to exercise due diligence in filing a visa petition on behalf of an alien described in clause (i) or (ii) may result in revocation of parole.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of certain breaks in presence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An alien shall be considered to have failed to maintain continuous physical presence in the United States under subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section if the alien has departed from the United States for any period in excess of 90 days or for any periods in the aggregate exceeding 180 days.</p>
