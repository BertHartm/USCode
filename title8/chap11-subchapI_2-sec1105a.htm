<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1105a. Judicial review of orders of deportation and exclusion</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Exclusiveness of procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The procedure prescribed by, and all the provisions of chapter 158 of title 28, shall apply to, and shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for, the judicial review of all final orders of deportation, heretofore or hereafter made against aliens within the United States pursuant to administrative proceedings under section 1252(b) of this title or pursuant to section 1252a of this title or comparable provisions of any prior Act, except that&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Time for filing petition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">a petition for review may be filed not later than 90 days after the date of the issuance of the final deportation order, or, in the case of an alien convicted of an aggravated felony (including an alien described in section 1252a of this title), not later than 30 days after the issuance of such order;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Venue</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">the venue of any petition for review under this section shall be in the judicial circuit in which the administrative proceedings before a special inquiry officer were conducted in whole or in part, or in the judicial circuit wherein is the residence, as defined in this chapter, of the petitioner, but not in more than one circuit;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Respondent; service of petition; stay of deportation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">the action shall be brought against the Immigration and Naturalization Service, as respondent. Service of the petition to review shall be made upon the Attorney General of the United States and upon the official of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in charge of the Service district in which the office of the clerk of the court is located. The service of the petition for review upon such official of the Service shall stay the deportation of the alien pending determination of the petition by the court, unless the court otherwise directs or unless the alien is convicted of an aggravated felony (including an alien described in section 1252a of this title), in which case the Service shall not stay the deportation of the alien pending determination of the petition of the court unless the court otherwise directs;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Determination upon administrative record</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">except as provided in clause (B) of paragraph (5) of this subsection, the petition shall be determined solely upon the administrative record upon which the deportation order is based and the Attorney General's findings of fact, if supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Claim of nationality; determination or transfer to district court for hearing de novo</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">whenever any petitioner, who seeks review of an order under this section, claims to be a national of the United States and makes a showing that his claim is not frivolous, the court shall (A) pass upon the issues presented when it appears from the pleadings and affidavits filed by the parties that no genuine issue of material fact is presented; or (B) where a genuine issue of material fact as to the petitioner's nationality is presented, transfer the proceedings to a United States district court for the district where the petitioner has his residence for hearing de novo of the nationality claim and determination as if such proceedings were originally initiated in the district court under the provisions of section 2201 of title 28. Any such petitioner shall not be entitled to have such issue determined under section 1503(a) of this title or otherwise;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:48 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Consolidation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">whenever a petitioner seeks review of an order under this section, any review sought with respect to a motion to reopen or reconsider such an order shall be consolidated with the review of the order;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Challenge of validity of deportation order in criminal proceeding; motion for judicial review before trial; hearing de novo on nationality claim; determination of motion; dismissal of indictment upon invalidity of order; appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">if the validity of a deportation order has not been judicially determined, its validity may be challenged in a criminal proceeding against the alien for violation of subsection (d) or (e) of section 1252 of this title only by separate motion for judicial review before trial. Such motion shall be determined by the court without a jury and before the trial of the general issue. Whenever a claim to United States nationality is made in such motion, and in the opinion of the court, a genuine issue of material fact as to the alien's nationality is presented, the court shall accord him a hearing de novo on the nationality claim and determine that issue as if proceedings had been initiated under the provisions of section 2201 of title 28. Any such alien shall not be entitled to have such issue determined under section 1503(a) of this title or otherwise. If no such hearing de novo as to nationality is conducted, the determination shall be made solely upon the administrative record upon which the deportation order is based and the Attorney General's findings of fact, if supported by reasonable, substantial and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive. If the deportation order is held invalid, the court shall dismiss the indictment and the United States shall have the right to appeal to the court of appeals within thirty days. The procedure on such appeals shall be as provided in the Federal rules of criminal procedure. No petition for review under this section may be filed by any alien during the pendency of a criminal proceeding against such alien for violation of subsection (d) or (e) of section 1252 of this title;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Deferment of deportation; compliance of alien with other provisions of law; detention or taking into custody of alien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">nothing in this section shall be construed to require the Attorney General to defer deportation of an alien after the issuance of a deportation order because of the right of judicial review of the order granted by this section, or to relieve any alien from compliance with subsections (d) and (e) of section 1252 of this title. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to preclude the Attorney General from detaining or continuing to detain an alien or from taking him into custody pursuant to subsection (c) of section 1252 of this title at any time after the issuance of a deportation order;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Typewritten record and briefs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">it shall not be necessary to print the record or any part thereof, or the briefs, and the court shall review the proceedings on a typewritten record and on typewritten briefs; and</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Habeas corpus</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">any alien held in custody pursuant to an order of deportation may obtain judicial review thereof by habeas corpus proceedings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation of certain aliens to habeas corpus proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, any alien against whom a final order of exclusion has been made heretofore or hereafter under the provisions of section 1226 of this title or comparable provisions of any prior Act may obtain judicial review of such order by habeas corpus proceedings and not otherwise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exhaustion of administrative remedies or departure from United States; disclosure of prior judicial proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An order of deportation or of exclusion shall not be reviewed by any court if the alien has not exhausted the administrative remedies available to him as of right under the immigration laws and regulations or if he has departed from the United States after the issuance of the order. Every petition for review or for habeas corpus shall state whether the validity of the order has been upheld in any prior judicial proceeding, and, if so, the nature and date thereof, and the court in which such proceeding took place. No petition for review or for habeas corpus shall be entertained if the validity of the order has been previously determined in any civil or criminal proceeding, unless the petition presents grounds which the court finds could not have been presented in such prior proceeding, or the court finds that the remedy provided by such prior proceeding was inadequate or ineffective to test the validity of the order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Petition contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A petition for review or for habeas corpus on behalf of an alien against whom a final order of deportation has been issued pursuant to section 1252a(b) of this title may challenge only&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) whether the alien is in fact the alien described in the order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) whether the alien is in fact an alien described in section 1252a(b)(2) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) whether the alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony and such conviction has become final; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) whether the alien was afforded the procedures required by section 1252a(b)(4) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No court shall have jurisdiction to review any issue other than an issue described in paragraph (1).</p>
