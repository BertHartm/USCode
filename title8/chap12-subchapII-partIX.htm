<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Powers without warrant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any officer or employee of the Service authorized under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General shall have power without warrant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his right to be or to remain in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to arrest any alien who in his presence or view is entering or attempting to enter the United States in violation of any law or regu<!-- PDFPage:286 -->lation made in pursuance of law regulating the admission, exclusion, expulsion, or removal of aliens, or to arrest any alien in the United States, if he has reason to believe that the alien so arrested is in the United States in violation of any such law or regulation and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest, but the alien arrested shall be taken without unnecessary delay for examination before an officer of the Service having authority to examine aliens as to their right to enter or remain in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) within a reasonable distance from any external boundary of the United States, to board and search for aliens any vessel within the territorial waters of the United States and any railway car, aircraft, conveyance, or vehicle, and within a distance of twenty-five miles from any such external boundary to have access to private lands, but not dwellings, for the purpose of patrolling the border to prevent the illegal entry of aliens into the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to make arrests for felonies which have been committed and which are cognizable under any law of the United States regulating the admission, exclusion, expulsion, or removal of aliens, if he has reason to believe that the person so arrested is guilty of such felony and if there is likelihood of the person escaping before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest, but the person arrested shall be taken without unnecessary delay before the nearest available officer empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the laws of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to make arrests&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for any offense against the United States, if the offense is committed in the officer's or employee's presence, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for any felony cognizable under the laws of the United States, if the officer or employee has reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing such a felony,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">if the officer or employee is performing duties relating to the enforcement of the immigration laws at the time of the arrest and if there is a likelihood of the person escaping before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, an officer or employee of the Service may carry a firearm and may execute and serve any order, warrant, subpoena, summons, or other process issued under the authority of the United States. The authority to make arrests under paragraph (5)(B) shall only be effective on and after the date on which the Attorney General publishes final regulations which (i) prescribe the categories of officers and employees of the Service who may use force (including deadly force) and the circumstances under which such force may be used, (ii) establish standards with respect to enforcement activities of the Service, (iii) require that any officer or employee of the Service is not authorized to make arrests under paragraph (5)(B) unless the officer or employee has received certification as having completed a training program which covers such arrests and standards described in clause (ii), and (iv) establish an expedited, internal review process for violations of such standards, which process is consistent with standard agency procedure regarding confidentiality of matters related to internal investigations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Administration of oath; taking of evidence</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Search without warrant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any officer or employee of the Service authorized and designated under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, whether individually or as one of a class, shall have power to conduct a search, without warrant, of the person, and of the personal effects in the possession of any person seeking admission to the United States, concerning whom such officer or employee may have reasonable cause to suspect that grounds exist for denial of admission to the United States under this chapter which would be disclosed by such search.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Detainer of aliens for violation of controlled substances laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an alien who is arrested by a Federal, State, or local law enforcement official for a violation of any law relating to controlled substances, if the official (or another official)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has reason to believe that the alien may not have been lawfully admitted to the United States or otherwise is not lawfully present in the United States,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) expeditiously informs an appropriate officer or employee of the Service authorized and designated by the Attorney General of the arrest and of facts concerning the status of the alien, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) requests the Service to determine promptly whether or not to issue a detainer to detain the alien,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the officer or employee of the Service shall promptly determine whether or not to issue such a detainer.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Restriction on warrantless entry in case of outdoor agricultural operations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section other than paragraph (3) of subsection <!-- PDFPage:287 -->(a) of this section, an officer or employee of the Service may not enter without the consent of the owner (or agent thereof) or a properly executed warrant onto the premises of a farm or other outdoor agricultural operation for the purpose of interrogating a person believed to be an alien as to the person's right to be or to remain in the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding section 1342 of title 31, the Attorney General may enter into a written agreement with a State, or any political subdivision of a State, pursuant to which an officer or employee of the State or subdivision, who is determined by the Attorney General to be qualified to perform a function of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States (including the transportation of such aliens across State lines to detention centers), may carry out such function at the expense of the State or political subdivision and to the extent consistent with State and local law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An agreement under this subsection shall require that an officer or employee of a State or political subdivision of a State performing a function under the agreement shall have knowledge of, and adhere to, Federal law relating to the function, and shall contain a written certification that the officers or employees performing the function under the agreement have received adequate training regarding the enforcement of relevant Federal immigration laws.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) In performing a function under this subsection, an officer or employee of a State or political subdivision of a State may use Federal property or facilities, as provided in a written agreement between the Attorney General and the State or subdivision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) With respect to each officer or employee of a State or political subdivision who is authorized to perform a function under this subsection, the specific powers and duties that may be, or are required to be, exercised or performed by the individual, the duration of the authority of the individual, and the position of the agency of the Attorney General who is required to supervise and direct the individual, shall be set forth in a written agreement between the Attorney General and the State or political subdivision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Attorney General may not accept a service under this subsection if the service will be used to displace any Federal employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Except as provided in paragraph (8), an officer or employee of a State or political subdivision of a State performing functions under this subsection shall not be treated as a Federal employee for any purpose other than for purposes of chapter 81 of title 5 (relating to compensation for injury) and sections 2671 through 2680 of title 28 (relating to tort claims).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) An officer or employee of a State or political subdivision of a State acting under color of authority under this subsection, or any agreement entered into under this subsection, shall be considered to be acting under color of Federal authority for purposes of determining the liability, and immunity from suit, of the officer or employee in a civil action brought under Federal or State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require any State or political subdivision of a State to enter into an agreement with the Attorney General under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(10) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an agreement under this subsection in order for any officer or employee of a State or political subdivision of a State&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1375. Mail-order bride business</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:298 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) There is a substantial &ldquo;mail-order bride&rdquo; business in the United States. With approximately 200 companies in the United States, an estimated 2,000 to 3,500 men in the United States find wives through mail-order bride catalogs each year. However, there are no official statistics available on the number of mail-order brides entering the United States each year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The companies engaged in the mail-order bride business earn substantial profits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Although many of these mail-order marriages work out, in many other cases, anecdotal evidence suggests that mail-order brides find themselves in abusive relationships. There is also evidence to suggest that a substantial number of mail-order marriages are fraudulent under United States law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Many mail-order brides come to the United States unaware or ignorant of United States immigration law. Mail-order brides who are battered often think that if they flee an abusive marriage, they will be deported. Often the citizen spouse threatens to have them deported if they report the abuse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that the rate of marriage fraud between foreign nationals and United States citizens or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence is 8 percent. It is unclear what percentage of these marriage fraud cases originate as mail-order marriages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Information dissemination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each international matchmaking organization doing business in the United States shall disseminate to recruits, upon recruitment, such immigration and naturalization information as the Immigration and Naturalization Service deems appropriate, in the recruit's native language, including information regarding conditional permanent residence status and the battered spouse waiver under such status, permanent resident status, marriage fraud penalties, the unregulated nature of the business engaged in by such organizations, and the study required under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Civil penalty</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any international matchmaking organization that the Attorney General determines has violated this subsection shall be subject, in addition to any other penalties that may be prescribed by law, to a civil money penalty of not more than $20,000 for each such violation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Procedures for imposition of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any penalty under subparagraph (A) may be imposed only after notice and opportunity for an agency hearing on the record in accordance with sections 554 through 557 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General, in consultation with the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization and the Director of the Violence Against Women Initiative of the Department of Justice, shall conduct a study of mail-order marriages to determine, among other things&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the number of such marriages;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the extent of marriage fraud in such marriages, including an estimate of the extent of marriage fraud arising from the services provided by international matchmaking organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the extent to which mail-order spouses utilize section 1254a(a)(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1375_1_target" name="1375_1">1</a></sup> of this title (providing for suspension of deportation in certain cases involving abuse), or section 1154(a)(1)(A)(iii) of this title (providing for certain aliens who have been abused to file a classification petition on their own behalf);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the extent of domestic abuse in mail-order marriages; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the need for continued or expanded regulation and education to implement the objectives of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 and the Immigration Marriage Fraud Amendments of 1986 with respect to mail-order marriages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 1 year after September 30, 1996, the Attorney General shall submit a report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate setting forth the results of the study conducted under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) International matchmaking organization</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;international matchmaking organization&rdquo; means a corporation, partnership, business, or other legal entity, whether or not organized under the laws of the United States or any State, that does business in the United States and for profit offers to United States citizens or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence, dating, matrimonial, or social referral services to nonresident noncitizens, by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an exchange of names, telephone numbers, addresses, or statistics;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) selection of photographs; or</p>
