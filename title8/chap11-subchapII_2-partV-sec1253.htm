<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Acceptance by designated country; deportation upon nonacceptance by country</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The deportation of an alien in the United States provided for in this chapter, or any other Act or treaty, shall be directed by the Attorney General to a country promptly designated by the alien if that country is willing to accept him into its territory, unless the Attorney General, in his discretion, concludes that deportation to such country would be prejudicial to the interests of the United States. No alien shall be permitted to make more than one such designation, nor shall any alien designate, as the place to which he wishes to be deported, any foreign territory contiguous to the United States or any island adjacent thereto or adjacent to the United States unless such alien is a native, citizen, subject, or national of, or had a residence in such designated foreign contiguous territory or adjacent island. If the government of the country designated by the alien fails finally to advise the Attorney General within three months following original inquiry whether that government will or will not accept such alien into its territory, such designation may thereafter be disregarded. Thereupon deportation of such alien shall be directed to any country of which such alien is a subject, national, or citizen if such country is willing to accept him into its territory. If the government of such country fails finally to advise the Attorney General or the alien within three months following the date of original inquiry, or within such other period as the Attorney General shall deem reasonable under the circumstances in a particular case, whether that government will or will not accept such alien into its territory, then such deportation shall be directed by the Attorney General within his discretion and without necessarily giving any priority or preference because of their order as herein set forth either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to the country from which such alien last entered the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the country in which is located the foreign port at which such alien embarked for the United States or for foreign contiguous territory;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:160 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to the country in which he was born;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to the country in which the place of his birth is situated at the time he is ordered deported;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to any country in which he resided prior to entering the country from which he entered the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to the country which had sovereignty over the birthplace of the alien at the time of his birth; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) if deportation to any of the foregoing places or countries is impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible, then to any country which is willing to accept such alien into its territory.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deportation during war</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the United States is at war and the deportation, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, of any alien who is deportable under any law of the United States shall be found by the Attorney General to be impracticable, inadvisable, inconvenient, or impossible because of enemy occupation of the country from which such alien came or wherein is located the foreign port at which he embarked for the United States or because of reasons connected with the war, such alien may, in the discretion of the Attorney General, be deported as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if such alien is a citizen or subject of a country whose recognized government is in exile, to the country in which is located that government in exile if that country will permit him to enter its territory; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if such alien is a citizen or subject of a country whose recognized government is not in exile, then to a country or any political or territorial subdivision thereof which is proximate to the country of which the alien is a citizen or subject, or, with the consent of the country of which the alien is a citizen or subject, to any other country.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment of deportation costs; within five years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If deportation proceedings are instituted at any time within five years after the entry of the alien for causes existing prior to or at the time of entry, the cost of removal to the port of deportation shall be at the expense of the appropriation for the enforcement of this chapter, and the deportation from such port shall be at the expense of the owner or owners of the vessels, aircraft, or other transportation lines by which such alien came to the United States, or if in the opinion of the Attorney General that is not practicable, at the expense of the appropriation for the enforcement of this chapter: <em>Provided</em>, That the costs of the deportation of any such alien from such port shall not be assessed against the owner or owners of the vessels, aircraft, or other transportation lines in the case of any alien who arrived in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa and who was inspected and admitted to the United States for permanent residence. In the case of an alien crewman, if deportation proceedings are instituted at any time within five years after the granting of the last conditional permit to land temporarily under the provisions of section 1282 of this title, the cost of removal to the port of deportation shall be at the expense of the appropriation for the enforcement of this chapter and the deportation from such port shall be at the expense of the owner or owners of the vessels or aircraft by which such alien came to the United States, or if in the opinion of the Attorney General that is not practicable, at the expense of the appropriation for the enforcement of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Cost of deportation, subsequent to five years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If deportation proceedings are instituted later than five years after the entry of the alien, or in the case of an alien crewman later than five years after the granting of the last conditional permit to land temporarily, the cost thereof shall be payable from the appropriation for the enforcement of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Refusal to transport or to pay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A failure or refusal on the part of the master, commanding officer, agent, owner, charterer, or consignee of a vessel, aircraft, or other transportation line to comply with the order of the Attorney General to take on board, guard safely, and transport to the destination specified any alien ordered to be deported under the provisions of this chapter, or a failure or refusal by any such person to comply with an order of the Attorney General to pay deportation expenses in accordance with the requirements of this section, shall be punished by the imposition of a penalty in the sum and manner prescribed in section 1227(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Payment of expenses of physically incapable deportees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When in the opinion of the Attorney General the mental or physical condition of an alien being deported is such as to require personal care and attendance, the Attorney General shall, when necessary, employ a suitable person for that purpose who shall accompany such alien to his final destination, and the expense incident to such service shall be defrayed in the same manner as the expense of deporting the accompanied alien is defrayed, and any failure or refusal to defray such expenses shall be punished in the manner prescribed by subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Countries delaying acceptance of deportees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the notification by the Attorney General that any country upon request denies or unduly delays acceptance of the return of any alien who is a national, citizen, subject, or resident thereof, the Secretary of State shall instruct consular officers performing their duties in the territory of such country to discontinue the issuance of immigrant visas to nationals, citizens, subjects, or residents of such country, until such time as the Attorney General shall inform the Secretary of State that such country has accepted such alien.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Withholding of deportation or return</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Attorney General shall not deport or return any alien (other than an alien described in section 1251(a)(4)(D) of this title) to a country if the Attorney General determines that such alien's life or freedom would be threatened in such country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:161 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any alien if the Attorney General determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the alien ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the alien, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) there are serious reasons for considering that the alien has committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside the United States prior to the arrival of the alien in the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) there are reasonable grounds for regarding the alien as a danger to the security of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of subparagraph (B), an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony shall be considered to have committed a particularly serious crime.</p>
