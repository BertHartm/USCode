<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Combating child trafficking at the border and ports of entry of the United States</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Policies and procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to enhance the efforts of the United States to prevent trafficking in persons, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Attorney <!-- PDFPage:284 -->General, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall develop policies and procedures to ensure that unaccompanied alien children in the United States are safely repatriated to their country of nationality or of last habitual residence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rules for children from contiguous countries</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any unaccompanied alien child who is a national or habitual resident of a country that is contiguous with the United States shall be treated in accordance with subparagraph (B), if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines, on a case-by-case basis, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such child has not been a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, and there is no credible evidence that such child is at risk of being trafficked upon return to the child's country of nationality or of last habitual residence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such child does not have a fear of returning to the child's country of nationality or of last habitual residence owing to a credible fear of persecution; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the child is able to make an independent decision to withdraw the child's application for admission to the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Return</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An immigration officer who finds an unaccompanied alien child described in subparagraph (A) at a land border or port of entry of the United States and determines that such child is inadmissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) permit such child to withdraw the child's application for admission pursuant to section 235(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1225(a)(4)); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) return such child to the child's country of nationality or country of last habitual residence.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Contiguous country agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary of State shall negotiate agreements between the United States and countries contiguous to the United States with respect to the repatriation of children. Such agreements shall be designed to protect children from severe forms of trafficking in persons, and shall, at a minimum, provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) no child shall be returned to the child's country of nationality or of last habitual residence unless returned to appropriate employees or officials, including child welfare officials where available, of the accepting country's government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) no child shall be returned to the child's country of nationality or of last habitual residence outside of reasonable business hours; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) border personnel of the countries that are parties to such agreements are trained in the terms of such agreements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Rule for other children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The custody of unaccompanied alien children not described in paragraph (2)(A) who are apprehended at the border of the United States or at a United States port of entry shall be treated in accordance with subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Screening</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 48 hours of the apprehension of a child who is believed to be described in paragraph (2)(A), but in any event prior to returning such child to the child's country of nationality or of last habitual residence, the child shall be screened to determine whether the child meets the criteria listed in paragraph (2)(A). If the child does not meet such criteria, or if no determination can be made within 48 hours of apprehension, the child shall immediately be transferred to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and treated in accordance with subsection (b). Nothing in this paragraph may be construed to preclude an earlier transfer of the child.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Ensuring the safe repatriation of children</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Repatriation pilot program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To protect children from trafficking and exploitation, the Secretary of State shall create a pilot program, in conjunction with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Homeland Security, nongovernmental organizations, and other national and international agencies and experts, to develop and implement best practices to ensure the safe and sustainable repatriation and reintegration of unaccompanied alien children into their country of nationality or of last habitual residence, including placement with their families, legal guardians, or other sponsoring agencies.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Assessment of country conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult the Department of State's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and the Trafficking in Persons Report in assessing whether to repatriate an unaccompanied alien child to a particular country.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Report on repatriation of unaccompanied alien children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 18 months after December 23, 2008, and annually thereafter, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, with assistance from the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall submit a report to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives on efforts to improve repatriation programs for unaccompanied alien children.

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a statement of the nationalities, ages, and gender of such children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a description of the policies and procedures used to effect the removal of such children from the United States and the steps taken to ensure that such children were safely and humanely repatriated to their country of nationality or of last ha<!-- PDFPage:285 -->bitual residence, including a description of the repatriation pilot program created pursuant to subparagraph (A);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) a description of the type of immigration relief sought and denied to such children;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) placed in removal proceedings under section 240 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1229a);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) eligible for relief under section 240B of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1229c) at no cost to the child; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Care and custody of unaccompanied alien children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Consistent with section 279 of title 6, and except as otherwise provided under subsection (a), the care and custody of all unaccompanied alien children, including responsibility for their detention, where appropriate, shall be the responsibility of the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each department or agency of the Federal Government shall notify the Department of Health and Human services&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1232_1_target" name="1232_1">1</a></sup> within 48 hours upon&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the apprehension or discovery of an unaccompanied alien child; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any claim or suspicion that an alien in the custody of such department or agency is under 18 years of age.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Transfers of unaccompanied alien children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except in the case of exceptional circumstances, any department or agency of the Federal Government that has an unaccompanied alien child in custody shall transfer the custody of such child to the Secretary of Health and Human Services not later than 72 hours after determining that such child is an unaccompanied alien child.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Age determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall develop procedures to make a prompt determination of the age of an alien, which shall be used by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Health and Human Services for children in their respective custody. At a minimum, these procedures shall take into account multiple forms of evidence, including the non-exclusive use of radiographs, to determine the age of the unaccompanied alien.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Providing safe and secure placements for children</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Policies and programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary of Homeland Security, Attorney General, and Secretary of State shall establish policies and programs to ensure that unaccompanied alien children in the United States are protected from traffickers and other persons seeking to victimize or otherwise engage such children in criminal, harmful, or exploitative activity, including policies and programs reflecting best practices in witness security programs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Safe and secure placements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to section 279(b)(2) of title 6, an unaccompanied alien child in the custody of the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall be promptly placed in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child. In making such placements, the Secretary may consider danger to self, danger to the community, and risk of flight. Placement of child trafficking victims may include placement in an Unaccompanied Refugee Minor program, pursuant to section 412(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1522(d)), if a suitable family member is not available to provide care. A child shall not be placed in a secure facility absent a determination that the child poses a danger to self or others or has been charged with having committed a criminal offense. The placement of a child in a secure facility shall be reviewed, at a minimum, on a monthly basis, in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Secretary, to determine if such placement remains warranted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Safety and suitability assessments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the requirements of subparagraph (B), an unaccompanied alien child may not be placed with a person or entity unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services makes a determination that the proposed custodian is capable of providing for the child's physical and mental well-being. Such determination shall, at a minimum, include verification of the custodian's identity and relationship to the child, if any, as well as an independent finding that the individual has not engaged in any activity that would indicate a potential risk to the child.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Home studies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Before placing the child with an individual, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall determine whether a home study is first necessary. A home study shall be conducted for a child who is a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, a special needs child with a disability (as defined in section 12102 of title 42), a child who has been a victim of physical or sexual abuse <!-- PDFPage:286 -->under circumstances that indicate that the child's health or welfare has been significantly harmed or threatened, or a child whose proposed sponsor clearly presents a risk of abuse, maltreatment, exploitation, or trafficking to the child based on all available objective evidence. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall conduct follow-up services, during the pendency of removal proceedings, on children for whom a home study was conducted and is authorized to conduct follow-up services in cases involving children with mental health or other needs who could benefit from ongoing assistance from a social welfare agency.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Access to information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 2 weeks after receiving a request from the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide information necessary to conduct suitability assessments from appropriate Federal, State, and local law enforcement and immigration databases.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Legal orientation presentations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall cooperate with the Executive Office for Immigration Review to ensure that custodians receive legal orientation presentations provided through the Legal Orientation Program administered by the Executive Office for Immigration Review. At a minimum, such presentations shall address the custodian's responsibility to attempt to ensure the child's appearance at all immigration proceedings and to protect the child from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Access to counsel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall ensure, to the greatest extent practicable and consistent with section 292 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1362), that all unaccompanied alien children who are or have been in the custody of the Secretary or the Secretary of Homeland Security, and who are not described in subsection (a)(2)(A), have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings or matters and protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking. To the greatest extent practicable, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall make every effort to utilize the services of pro bono counsel who agree to provide representation to such children without charge.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Child advocates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to appoint independent child advocates for child trafficking victims and other vulnerable unaccompanied alien children. A child advocate shall be provided access to materials necessary to effectively advocate for the best interest of the child. The child advocate shall not be compelled to testify or provide evidence in any proceeding concerning any information or opinion received from the child in the course of serving as a child advocate. The child advocate shall be presumed to be acting in good faith and be immune from civil and criminal liability for lawful conduct of duties as described in this provision.</p>
