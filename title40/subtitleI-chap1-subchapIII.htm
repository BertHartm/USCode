<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12512, Apr. 29, 1985, 50 F.R. 18453, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including section 486(a) of title 40 of the United States Code [now 40 U.S.C. 121(a)], and in order to ensure that Federal real property resources are treated in accordance with their value as national assets and in the best interests of the Nation's taxpayers, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>General Requirements</em>. To ensure the effective and economical use of America's real property and public land assets, establish a focal point for the enunciation of clear and consistent Federal policies regarding the acquisition, management, and disposal of properties, and assure management accountability for implementing Federal real property management reforms, all Executive departments and agencies shall take immediate action to recognize the importance of such resources through increased management attention, establishment of clear goals and objectives, improved policies and levels of accountability, and other appropriate actions. Specifically:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The Domestic Policy Council shall serve as the forum for approving government-wide real property management policies;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) All Executive departments and agencies shall establish internal policies and systems of accountability that ensure effective use of real property in support of mission-related activities, consistent with Federal policies regarding the acquisition, management, and disposal of such assets. All such agencies shall periodically review their real property holdings and conduct surveys of such property in accordance with standards and procedures determined by the Administrator of General Services. All such agencies shall also develop annual real property management improvement plans that include clear and concise goals and objectives related to all aspects of real property management, and identify sales, work space management, productivity, and excess property targets;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall review, through the management and budget review processes, the efforts of departments and agencies toward achieving the government-wide property management policies established pursuant to this Order. Savings achieved as a result of improved management shall be applied to reduce Federal spending and to support program delivery;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The Office of Management and Budget and the General Services Administration shall, in consultation with the land managing agencies, develop legislative initiatives that seek to improve Federal real property management through the adoption of appropriate private sector management techniques; the elimination of duplication of effort among agencies; and the establishment of managerial accountability for implementing effective and efficient real property management practices; and</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 12954. Ensuring the Economical and Efficient Administration and Completion of Federal Government Contracts</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12954, Mar. 8, 1995, 60 F.R. 13023, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Efficient economic performance and productivity are directly related to the existence of cooperative working relationships between employers and employees. When Federal contractors become involved in prolonged labor disputes with their employees, the Federal Government's economy, efficiency, and cost of operations are adversely affected. In order to operate as effectively as possible, by receiving timely goods and quality services, the Federal Government must assist the entities with which it has contractual relations to develop stable relationships with their employees.</p>
<p class="note-body">An important aspect of a stable collective bargaining relationship is the balance between allowing businesses to operate during a strike and preserving worker rights. This balance is disrupted when permanent replacement employees are hired. It has been found that strikes involving permanent replacement workers are longer in duration than other strikes. In addition, the use of permanent replacements can change a limited dispute into a broader, more contentious struggle, thereby exacerbating the problems that initially led to <!-- PDFPage:16 -->the strike. By permanently replacing its workers, an employer loses the accumulated knowledge, experience, skill, and expertise of its incumbent employees. These circumstances then adversely affect the businesses and entities, such as the Federal Government, which rely on that employer to provide high quality and reliable goods or services.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, and by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including 40 U.S.C. 486(a) [now 40 U.S.C. 121(a)] and 3 U.S.C. 301, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, contracting agencies shall not contract with employers that permanently replace lawfully striking employees. All discretion under this Executive order shall be exercised consistent with this policy.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. (a) The Secretary of Labor (&ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) may investigate an organizational unit of a Federal contractor to determine whether the unit has permanently replaced lawfully striking workers. Such investigation shall be conducted in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary shall receive and may investigate complaints by employees of any entity covered under section 2(a) of this order where such complaints allege lawfully striking employees have been permanently replaced.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Secretary may hold such hearings, public or private, as he or she deems advisable, to determine whether an entity covered under section 2(a) has permanently replaced lawfully striking employees.</p>

(a) When the Secretary determines that a contractor has permanently replaced lawfully striking employees, the Secretary may make a finding that it is appropriate to terminate the contract for convenience. The Secretary shall transmit that finding to the head of any department or agency that contracts with the contractor.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The head of the contracting department or agency may object to the termination for convenience of a contract or contracts of a contractor determined to have permanently replaced legally striking employees. If the head of the agency so objects, he or she shall set forth the reasons for not terminating the contract or contracts in a response in writing to the Secretary. In such case, the termination for convenience shall not be issued. The head of the contracting agency or department shall report to the Secretary those contracts that have been terminated for convenience under this section.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4.

The Secretary shall notify the Administrator of the General Services Administration of the debarment, and the Administrator shall include the contractor on the consolidated list of debarred contractors. Departments and agencies shall not solicit offers from, award contracts to, or consent to subcontracts with these contractors unless the head of the agency or his or her designee determines, in writing, that there is a compelling reason for such action, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The scope of the debarment normally will be limited to those organizational units of a Federal contractor that the Secretary finds to have permanently replaced lawfully striking workers.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The period of the debarment may not extend beyond the date when the labor dispute precipitating the permanent replacement of lawfully striking workers has been resolved, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5.

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. Each contracting department and agency shall cooperate with the Secretary and provide such information and assistance as the Secretary may require in the performance of the Secretary's functions under this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8.

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9.

The meaning of the term &ldquo;organizational unit of a Federal contractor&rdquo; as used in this order shall be defined in regulations that shall be issued by the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with affected agencies. This order shall apply only to contracts in excess of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.</p>
