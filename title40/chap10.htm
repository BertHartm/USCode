In determining whether the property is to be transferred for donation under this subsection, no distinction shall be made between property capitalized in a working-capital fund established under section 2208 of title 10, or any similar fund, and any other property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of surplus personal property under the control of the Department of Defense, the Secretary of Defense shall determine whether such property is usable and necessary for educational activities which are of special interest to the armed services, such as maritime academies, or military, naval, Air Force, or Coast Guard preparatory schools. If the Secretary determines that such property is usable and necessary for said purposes, the Secretary shall allocate it for transfer by the Administrator to the appropriate State agency for distribution, through donation, to such educational activities. If the Secretary determines that such property is not usable and necessary for such purposes, it may be disposed of in accordance with paragraph (3) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except for surplus personal property transferred pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Administrator shall, pursuant to criteria which are based on need and utilization and established after such consultation with State agencies as is feasible, allocate such property among the States in&nbsp;<sup><a href="#484_1_target" name="484_1">1</a></sup> a fair and equitable basis (taking into account the condition of the property as well as the original acquisition cost thereof), and transfer to the State agency property selected by it for distribution through donation within the State&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Before property may be transferred to any State agency, such State shall develop, according to State law, a detailed plan of operation, developed in conformity with the provisions of this subsection, which shall include adequate assurance that the State agency has the necessary organizational and operational authority and capability, including staff, facilities, means and methods of financing, and procedures with respect to: accountability, internal and external audits, cooperative agreements, compliance and utilization reviews, equitable distribution and property disposal, determination of eligibility, and assistance through consultation with advisory bodies and public and private groups. The chief executive officer shall certify and submit the plan to the Administrator. In the event that a State legislature has not developed, according to State law, a State plan within two hundred and seventy calendar days after October 17, 1976, the chief executive officer of the State shall approve, and submit to the Administrator, a temporary State plan. No such plan, and no major amendment thereof, shall be filed with the Administrator until sixty days after general notice of the proposed plan or amendment has been published and interested persons have been given at least thirty days during which to submit comments. In developing and implementing the State plan, the relative needs and resources of all public agencies and other eligible institutions within the State shall be taken into consideration.

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The State plan shall provide for the fair and equitable distribution of property within such State based on the relative needs and resources of interested public agencies and other eligible institutions within the State and their abilities to utilize the property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) The State plan of operation shall require the State agency to utilize a management control system and accounting system for donable property transferred under this section of the same types as are required by State law for State-owned property, except that the State agency, with the approval of the chief executive officer of the State, may elect, in lieu of such systems, to utilize such other management control and accounting systems as are effective to govern the utilization, inventory control, accountability, and disposal of property under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The State plan of operation shall require the State agency to provide for the return of donable property for further distribution if such property, while still usable, has not been placed in use for the purpose for which it was donated within one year of donation or ceases to be used by the donee for such purposes within one year of being placed in use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The State plan shall require the State agency, insofar as practicable, to select property requested by a public agency or other eligible institution within the State and, if so requested by the recipient, to arrange shipment of that property, when acquired, directly to the recipient.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Where the State agency is authorized to assess and collect service charges from participating recipients to cover direct and reasonable indirect costs of its activities, the method of establishing such charges shall be set out in the State plan of operation. Such charges shall be fair and equitable and shall be based on services performed by the State agency, including, but not limited to, screening, packing, crating, removal, and transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) The State plan of operation shall provide that the State agency may impose reasonable terms, conditions, reservations, and restrictions on the use of property to be donated under paragraph (3) of this subsection and shall impose such terms, conditions, reservations, and restrictions in the case of any passenger motor vehicle and any item of other property having a unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more. If the Administrator finds that an item or items have characteristics that require special handling or use limitations, he may impose appropriate conditions on the donation of such property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) The State plan of operation shall provide that surplus property which the State agency determines cannot be utilized by eligible recipients shall be disposed of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) subject to the disapproval of the Administrator within thirty days after notice to him, through transfer by the State agency to another State agency or through abandonment or destruction where the property has no commercial value or the estimated cost of its continued care and handling would exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) otherwise pursuant to the provisions of this Act under such terms and conditions and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Administrator.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding sections 485 and 512(c) of this title, the Administrator, from the proceeds of sale of any such property, may reimburse the State agency for such expenses relating to the care and handling of such property as he shall deem appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) As used in this subsection, (A) the term &ldquo;public agency&rdquo; means any State, political subdivision thereof (including any unit of local government or economic development district), or any department, agency, instrumentality thereof (including instrumentalities created by compact or other agreement between States or political subdivisions), or any Indian tribe, band, group, pueblo, or community located on a State reservation and (B) the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; means the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Disposition of receipts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All proceeds under this subchapter from any transfer of excess property to a Federal agency for its use, or from any sale, lease, or other disposition of surplus property, shall be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts, except as provided in subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), and (h) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deposit of proceeds from sales; use; report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (h) of this section, all the proceeds of such dispositions of surplus real and related personal property made by the Administrator of General Services shall be set aside in a separate fund in the Treasury. Not more than an amount to be determined quarterly by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget may be obligated from such fund by the Administrator to pay the direct expenses incurred for the utilization of excess property and the disposal of surplus property under this Act for fees of appraisers, auctioneers, and realty brokers, for costs of environmental and historic preservation services, and for advertising and surveying. Such payments from this fund may be used either to pay such expenses directly or to reimburse the fund or appropriation initially bearing such expenses. Fees paid to appraisers, auctioneers, and brokers shall be in accordance with the scale of fees customarily paid for such services in similar commercial transactions, and in no event shall more than 12 per centum of the proceeds of all dispositions within each fiscal year of surplus real and related personal property be paid out of such proceeds under this authorization to meet direct expenses incurred in connection with such dispositions. Periodically, but not less often than once each year, any excess funds beyond current operating needs shall be transferred from the fund to miscellaneous receipts: <em>Provided</em>, That a report of receipts, disbursements, and transfers to miscellaneous receipts under this authorization shall be made annually in connection with the budget estimates to the Director of Office of Management and Budget and to the Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Credit to reimbursable fund or appropriation on certain transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where the property transferred or disposed of was acquired by the use of funds either not appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury or appropriated therefrom but by law reimbursable from assessment, tax, or other revenue or receipts, then the net proceeds of the disposition or transfer shall be credited to the reimbursable fund or appropriation or paid to the Federal agency which determined such property to be excess: <em>Provided</em>, That the proceeds shall be credited to miscellaneous receipts in any case when the agency which determined the property to be excess shall deem it uneconomical or impractical to ascertain the amount of net proceeds. As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;net proceeds of the disposition or transfer&rdquo; means the proceeds of the disposition or transfer minus all expenses incurred for care and handling and disposition or transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special account deposits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any Federal agency disposing of surplus property under this subchapter (1) may deposit, in a special account with the Treasurer of the United States, such amount of the proceeds of such dispositions as it deems necessary to permit appropriate refunds to purchasers when any disposition is rescinded or does not become final, or payments for breach of any warranty, and (2) may withdraw therefrom amounts so to be refunded or paid, without regard to the origin of the funds withdrawn.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Sale proceeds offset against price or cost of contractor's work</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where any contract entered into by an executive agency or any subcontract under such contract authorizes the proceeds of any sale of property in the custody of the contractor or subcontractor to be credited to the price or cost of <!-- PDFPage:198 -->the work covered by such contract or subcontract, the proceeds of any such sale shall be credited in accordance with the contract or subcontract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Acceptance of property in lieu of cash</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any executive agency entitled to receive cash under any contract covering the lease, sale or other disposition of surplus property may in its discretion accept, in lieu of cash, any property determined by the President to be strategic or critical material at the prevailing market price thereof at the time the cash payment or payments became or become due.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Management of credit, leases, and permits on property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where credit has been extended in connection with any disposition of surplus property under this subchapter or by War Assets Administration (or its predecessor agencies) under the Surplus Property Act of 1944, or where such disposition has been by lease or permit, the Administrator shall administer and manage such credit, lease, or permit, and any security therefor, and may enforce, adjust, and settle any right of the Government with respect thereto in such manner and upon such terms as he deems in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Property under control of a military department</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Secretary of a military department determines that real property, and improvements thereon, under the control of that department (other than property at a military installation designated for closure or realignment) is excess to the needs of that department, the Secretary of Defense shall provide that the property be made available for transfer without reimbursement to the other military departments within the Department of Defense. If the property is not transferred to another military department, the Secretary of the military department concerned shall request the Administrator to transfer or dispose of such property in accordance with the provisions of this Act, section 13(g) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (50 U.S.C. App. 1622(g)), or other applicable law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator shall deposit any proceeds (less expenses of transferring or disposing of the property as provided in subsection (b) of this section) in a special account in the Treasury of the United States. The amount deposited in such account with respect to the transfer or disposal of any such property shall be available, to the extent provided in appropriation Acts, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 50 percent of such amount shall be available for facility maintenance and repair or environmental restoration at the military installation where the property is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 50 percent of such amount shall be available for facility maintenance and repair and for environmental restoration by the military department that had jurisdiction over the property before it was disposed of or transferred.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) As part of the annual request for authorizations of appropriations to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives, the Secretary of Defense shall include an accounting of each transfer and disposal made in accordance with this subsection during the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which the request is made, including a detailed explanation of each such transfer and disposal and of the use of the proceeds received from it by the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This subsection does not apply to damaged or deteriorated military family housing facilities conveyed under section 2854a of title 10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;military installation&rdquo; shall have the meaning given that term in section 2687(e)(1) of title 10.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Recovery of costs incurred in sales of personal property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator may retain from the proceeds of sales of personal property conducted by the General Services Administration amounts necessary to recover, to the extent practicable, costs incurred by the General Services Administration (or its agent) in conducting such sales. The Administrator shall deposit amounts retained into the General Supply Fund established under section 756(a) of this title and may use such portion of amounts so deposited as is necessary to pay (1) direct costs incurred by the General Services Administration in conducting sales of personal property, and (2) indirect costs incurred by the General Services Administration that are reasonably related to those sales. Amounts retained that are not needed to pay the direct and indirect costs incurred shall periodically, but not less than annually, be transferred from the General Supply Fund to the general fund or another appropriate account in the Treasury.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 12954. Ensuring the Economical and Efficient Administration and Completion of Federal Government Contracts</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12954, Mar. 8, 1995, 60 F.R. 13023, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Efficient economic performance and productivity are directly related to the existence of cooperative working relationships between employers and employees. When Federal contractors become involved in prolonged labor disputes with their employees, the Federal Government's economy, efficiency, and cost of operations are adversely affected. In order to operate as effectively as possible, by receiving timely goods and quality services, the Federal Government must assist the entities with which it has contractual relations to develop stable relationships with their employees.</p>
<p class="note-body">An important aspect of a stable collective bargaining relationship is the balance between allowing businesses to operate during a strike and preserving worker rights. This balance is disrupted when permanent replacement employees are hired. It has been found that strikes involving permanent replacement workers are longer in duration than other strikes. In addition, the use of permanent replacements can change a limited dispute into a broader, more contentious struggle, thereby exacerbating the problems that initially led to the strike. By permanently replacing its workers, an employer loses the accumulated knowledge, experience, skill, and expertise of its incumbent employees. These circumstances then adversely affect the businesses and entities, such as the Federal Government, which rely on that employer to provide high quality and reliable goods or services.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, and by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including 40 U.S.C. 486(a) and 3 U.S.C. 301, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, contracting agencies shall not contract with employers that permanently replace lawfully striking employees. All discretion under this Executive order shall be exercised consistent with this policy.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. (a) The Secretary of Labor (&ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) may investigate an organizational unit of a Federal contractor to determine whether the unit has permanently replaced lawfully striking workers.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the unexpired portion of any lease of space to the Government is determined by the Administrator to be surplus property and the property is thereafter disposed of by sublease by the Administrator, the Administrator is authorized, notwithstanding section 485(a) of this title, to deposit rental received in the buildings management fund (subsection (f) of this section) and defray from the fund any costs necessary to provide services to the Government's lessee and to pay the rent not otherwise provided for on the lease of the space to the Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Installation, repair, and replacement of sidewalks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any executive agency is authorized to install, repair, and replace sidewalks around buildings, installations, properties, or grounds under the control of such agency and owned by the United States within the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the possessions of the United States, by reimbursement to a State or political subdivision thereof, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and a possession of the United States, or otherwise.</p>

Such rates and charges shall approximate commercial charges for comparable space and services, except that with respect to those buildings for which the Administrator of General Services is responsible for alterations only (as the term &ldquo;alter&rdquo; is defined in section 612(5) of this title), the rates charged the occupant for such services shall be fixed by the Administrator so as to recover only the approximate applicable cost incurred by him in providing such alterations. The Administrator may exempt anyone from the charges required by this subsection if he determines that such charges would be infeasible or impractical. To the extent any such exemption is granted, appropriations to the General Services Administration are authorized to reimburse the fund for any loss of revenue.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Charges for space and services furnished by executive agencies; approval of rates by Administrator; credit to appropriation or fund</h4>

The Administrator shall give Federal employees priority in using the telecommuting centers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Administrator shall charge user fees for the use of any telecommuting center. The amount of the user fee shall approximate commercial charges for comparable space and services except that in no instance shall such fee be less than that necessary to pay the cost of establishing and operating the center, including the reasonable cost of renovation and replacement of furniture, fixtures, and equipment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Amounts received by the Administrator after September 30, 1993, as user fees for use of any telecommuting center may be deposited into the Fund established under subsection (f) of this section and may be used by the Administrator to pay costs incurred in the establishment and operation of the center.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 18 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. The plan transfers to the Administrator of General Services the functions of the various Federal agencies with respect to leasing and assigning general-purpose space in buildings and the operation, maintenance, and custody of office buildings. Since such authority is already largely concentrated in the General Services Administration with respect to the District of Columbia, the plan principally relates to the administration of these functions in the field.</p>
<p class="note-body">The transfers made by this plan will promote more economical leasing, better utilization of building space, and more efficient operation of Government-controlled office buildings. They will effectuate the recommendations of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government with respect to concentrating in the General Services Administration the responsibility for space allotment and the operation of Government buildings outside of the District of Columbia. Likewise, they will extend the principles laid down by the Congress in enacting the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to another important area of Government-wide administrative services&mdash;the administration of Government office buildings and general-purpose building space in the field.</p>
<p class="note-body">Within the District of Columbia, one agency, the Public Buildings Service of the General Services Administration, has long had the operation and custody of most Government buildings and the leasing and assignment of space for executive agencies. Thus, nearly all requests for building space are handled by a single organization which is responsible for seeing that agencies are properly and efficiently housed. This arrangement has proved its worth and has repeatedly been approved by the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">Outside of the National Capital, however, responsibility for the acquisition and control of building space and the operation of Government buildings is widely diffused. A variety of agencies operate and control general-purpose buildings. If quarters are not available in Federal buildings, each agency ordinarily does its own leasing. As a result, in some cases Federal agencies have contracted for space at high rentals at the very time that other agencies have been giving up surplus low-cost space.</p>
<p class="note-body">The assignment of space in Government-owned buildings outside of Washington is also divided among a number of agencies. While the Public Buildings Service constructs a large part of the Government buildings, it operates and controls the assignment of space in only a small proportion of them. The Post Office Department operates and allocates the space in post-office buildings, several hundred of which contain substantial amounts of office space available for other agencies. During and immediately after the war several other Federal agencies acquired office buildings in the field. As their activities have contracted, surplus space in many of these structures has become available for other uses.</p>
<p class="note-body">This plan concentrates in the General Services Administration the responsibility for the leasing and assignment of what is termed general-purpose building space; that is, space which is suitable for the uses of a number of Federal agencies. It specifically excludes space in buildings at military posts, arsenals, navy yards, and similar defense installations and space in hospitals, laboratories, factories, and other special-purpose buildings.</p>
<p class="note-body">Also, the plan excludes the Post Office Department from the transfer of leasing authority since the Department has a highly developed organization for this purpose, and it limits the transfer of space assignment authority in post-office buildings to the space not occupied by the Department. Further, it gives the needs of the Post Office Department priority in the assignment of space in post-office buildings. Thus, the plan amply safeguards the interests of the Post Office Department while making it possible to include the general office space in post-office buildings in any given city with other similar space under Federal control in planning and executing an efficient program for housing Government agencies in that area.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition, the plan transfers to the General Services Administration the operation, maintenance, and custody of office buildings owned or leased by the Government, including those post-office buildings which are not used predominantly for post-office purposes. This will make it possible to establish a single organization for the operation and maintenance of Government office buildings in principal cities in the field as has proved desirable in the National Capital. Since many post offices are in fact primarily large office buildings, the plan includes in this transfer the post-office buildings which are not used predominantly for post-office purposes. This will relieve the Post Office Department of a considerable expenditure for building operation and maintenance which properly should not be charged against postal revenues.</p>
<p class="note-body">While the plan effects a broad transfer of functions with respect to leasing and assignment of space and the operation and maintenance of office buildings, it specifically authorizes the Administrator of General Services to delegate the performance of any part of these functions to other agencies subject to such regulations as he deems desirable for economical and effective administration. In this the plan follows the pattern adopted by the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 for other branches of property management. In large urban centers where numerous Federal units are located unified administration of space activities by the General Services Administration will normally be advantageous. On the other hand, in the smaller communities it will no doubt be desirable to delegate the work back to the agencies directly affected, to be carried on under standards laid down by the Administrator of General Services. The plan provides ample flexibility for working out the most effective administrative arrangement for each type of situation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The fundamental soundness and economy of centralized administration of building space have been amply demonstrated in the National Capital. By virtue of unified control it has been possible since the war to accomplish far-reaching changes which have consolidated agencies in much fewer locations, released many of the rented buildings, and greatly reduced the cost of housing the Government establishment. Similar procedures applied in the larger centers of field activity should produce substantial savings.</p>
<p class="note-body">After investigation, I have found, and hereby declare, that each reorganization contained in this plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body">While it is not possible at this time to calculate the reduction in expenditures which will result from this plan, it can safely be predicted that it will produce substantial savings. I am confident that this reorganization plan will constitute a significant improvement in Federal business practice and will bring about an important increase in efficiency in housing Government agencies.</p>

<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Aug. 10, 1995, 60 F.R. 42023, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">Recent advancements in mobile telecommunications technology present an opportunity for the rapid construction of the Nation's wireless communications infrastructure. As a matter of policy, the Federal Gov<!-- PDFPage:219 -->ernment shall encourage the efficient and timely implementation of such new technologies and the concomitant infrastructure buildout as a means of stimulating economic growth and creating new jobs. The recent auctioning and impending licensing of radio frequencies for mobile personal communications services presents the Federal Government with the opportunity to foster new technologies and to encourage the development of communications infrastructure by making Federal property available for the siting of mobile services antennas.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, I hereby direct the Administrator of General Services, within 90 days, in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Interior, Defense, and the heads of such other agencies as the Administrator may determine, to develop procedures necessary to facilitate appropriate access to Federal property for the siting of mobile services antennas.</p>
<p class="note-body">The procedures should be developed in accordance with the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. (a) Upon request, and to the extent permitted by law and where practicable, executive departments and agencies shall make available Federal Government buildings and lands for the siting of mobile service antennas. This should be done in accordance with Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, and consistent with national security concerns (including minimizing mutual electromagnetic interactions), public health and safety concerns, environmental and aesthetic concerns, preservation of historic buildings and monuments, protection of natural and cultural resources, protection of national park and wilderness values, protection of National Wildlife Refuge systems, and subject to any Federal requirements promulgated by the agency managing the facility and the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and other relevant departments and agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Antennas on Federal buildings or land may not contain any advertising.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Federal property does not include lands held by the United States in trust for individual or Native American tribal governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Agencies shall retain discretion to reject inappropriate siting requests, and assure adequate protection of public property and timely removal of equipment and structures at the end of service.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. All procedures and mechanisms adopted regarding access to Federal property shall be clear and simple so as to facilitate the efficient and rapid buildout of the national wireless communications infrastructure.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. Unless otherwise prohibited by or inconsistent with Federal law, agencies shall charge fees based on market value for siting antennas on Federal property, and may use competitive procedures if not all applicants can be accommodated.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum does not give the siting of mobile services antennas priority over other authorized uses of Federal buildings or land.</p>
<p class="note-body">All independent regulatory commissions and agencies are requested to comply with the provisions of this memorandum.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum is not intended to create any right, benefit or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to carry out the policy, expressed in section 471 of this title, to provide for an economical and efficient system for transportation of Government personnel and property, it is further intended by the Congress in enacting this <!-- PDFPage:223 -->section to (1) provide for the proper identification of Government motor vehicles; (2) establish effective means of limiting their use to official governmental purposes; (3) reduce the number of Government-owned vehicles to the minimum necessary for transaction of the public business; (4) provide wherever practicable for centrally operated interagency pools or systems for local transportation of Government personnel and property; and (5) establish procedures to insure safe operation of motor vehicles on Government business.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determinations by Administrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to regulations issued by the President pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the Administrator shall in respect of executive agencies, and to the extent that he determines that so doing is advantageous to the Government in terms of economy, efficiency, or service, after consultation with and with due regard to the program activities of the agencies concerned, (1) consolidate, take over, acquire, or arrange for the operation by any executive agency of, motor vehicles and other related equipment and supplies for the purpose of establishing motor vehicle pools and systems to serve the needs of executive agencies; and (2) provide for the establishment, maintenance, and operation (including servicing and storage) of motor vehicle pools or systems for transportation of property or passengers, and for furnishing such motor vehicle and related services to executive agencies. Such motor vehicle services may be furnished, as determined by the Administrator, through the use, under rental or other arrangements, of motor vehicles of private fleet operators, taxicab companies, local or interstate common carriers, or Government-owned motor vehicles, or combinations thereof. The Administrator shall, so far as practicable, provide any of the services specified in this subsection to any Federal agency, mixed ownership corporation (as defined in chapter 91 of title 31), or the District of Columbia, upon its request.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall, within ninety days after the effective date of this section, issue regulations under this section to establish procedures for the taking effect of determinations made by the Administrator pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Such regulations shall provide for adequate notice to executive agencies of any determinations affecting them or their functions; for independent review and decision as directed by the President of any determination not mutually agreed upon between the Administrator and the agency concerned, including exemption of any agency, in whole or in part, from any determination; and for enforcement of determinations becoming effective under such regulations. No determination made pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall be binding upon any agency except as provided in such regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payment of costs; fixing of prices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The General Supply Fund provided for in section 756 of this title shall be available for use by or under the direction and control of the Administrator for paying all elements of cost (including the purchase or rental price of motor vehicles and other related equipment and supplies) incident to the establishment, maintenance, and operation (including servicing and storage) of motor vehicle pools or systems for the transportation of property or passengers, and to the furnishing of such motor vehicles and equipment and related services pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Payments by requisitioning agencies so served shall be at prices fixed by the Administrator at levels which will recover, so far as practicable, all such elements of cost, and may, in the Administrator's discretion, include increments for the estimated replacement cost of such motor vehicles, equipment, and supplies. Such increments may, notwithstanding section 756(e) of this title, be retained as part of the capital of the General Supply Fund, but shall be available only for replacement of such motor vehicles, equipment, and supplies.
