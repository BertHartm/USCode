<p class="note-body">This section is added to provide an accurate literal translation of the words &ldquo;this Act&rdquo;, meaning the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. In the positive law codification of title 40, most of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 is restated as subtitle I of title 40. However, title III of the Act, which is outside the scope of the positive law codification, remains classified to the United States Code as 41 U.S.C. 251 et seq. Where the words &ldquo;this Act&rdquo; are restated, substituting the words &ldquo;this subtitle&rdquo; does not yield an accurate literal translation because &ldquo;this subtitle&rdquo; does not include title III of the Act. This section does not subject any provision of law to title III of the Act if that provision was not subject to title III prior to the positive law codification of title 40.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12512, Apr. 29, 1985, 50 F.R. 18453, which related to Federal real property management, was revoked by Ex. Ord. No. 13327, &sect;8, Feb. 4, 2004, 69 F.R. 5897, set out below.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 12954. Ensuring the Economical and Efficient Administration and Completion of Federal Government Contracts</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12954, Mar. 8, 1995, 60 F.R. 13023, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Efficient economic performance and productivity are directly related to the existence of cooperative working relationships between employers and employees. When Federal contractors become involved in prolonged labor disputes with their employees, the Federal Government's economy, efficiency, and cost of operations are adversely affected. In order to operate as effectively as possible, by receiving timely goods and quality services, the Federal Government must assist the entities with which it has contractual relations to develop stable relationships with their employees.</p>
<p class="note-body">An important aspect of a stable collective bargaining relationship is the balance between allowing businesses to operate during a strike and preserving worker rights. This balance is disrupted when permanent replacement employees are hired. It has been found that strikes involving permanent replacement workers are longer in duration than other strikes. In addition, the use of permanent replacements can change a limited dispute into a broader, more contentious struggle, thereby exacerbating the problems that initially led to the strike. By permanently replacing its workers, an employer loses the accumulated knowledge, experience, skill, and expertise of its incumbent employees. These circumstances then adversely affect the businesses and entities, such as the Federal Government, which rely on that employer to provide high quality and reliable goods or services.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, and by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including 40 U.S.C. 486(a) [now 40 U.S.C. 121(a)] and 3 U.S.C. 301, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, contracting agencies shall not contract with employers that permanently replace lawfully striking employees. All discretion under this Executive order shall be exercised consistent with this policy.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. (a) The Secretary of Labor (&ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) may investigate an organizational unit of a Federal contractor to determine whether the unit has permanently replaced lawfully striking workers. Such investigation shall be conducted in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary shall receive and may investigate complaints by employees of any entity covered under section 2(a) of this order where such complaints allege lawfully striking employees have been permanently replaced.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Secretary may hold such hearings, public or private, as he or she deems advisable, to determine whether an entity covered under section 2(a) has permanently replaced lawfully striking employees.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. (a) When the Secretary determines that a contractor has permanently replaced lawfully striking employees, the Secretary may make a finding that it is appropriate to terminate the contract for convenience. The Secretary shall transmit that finding to the head of any department or agency that contracts with the contractor.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The head of the contracting department or agency may object to the termination for convenience of a contract or contracts of a contractor determined to have permanently replaced legally striking employees. If the head of the agency so objects, he or she shall set forth the reasons for not terminating the contract or contracts in a response in writing to the Secretary. In such case, the termination for convenience shall not be issued. The head of the contracting agency or department shall report to the Secretary those contracts that have been terminated for convenience under this section.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. (a) When the Secretary determines that a contractor has permanently replaced lawfully striking employees, the Secretary may debar the contractor, thereby making the contractor ineligible to receive government contracts. The Secretary shall notify the Administrator of the General Services Administration of the debarment, and the Administrator shall include the contractor on the consolidated list of debarred contractors. Departments and agencies shall not solicit offers from, award contracts to, or consent to subcontracts with these contractors unless the head of the agency or his or her designee determines, in writing, that there is a compelling reason for such action, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The scope of the debarment normally will be limited to those organizational units of a Federal contractor that the Secretary finds to have permanently replaced lawfully striking workers.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The period of the debarment may not extend beyond the date when the labor dispute precipitating the permanent replacement of lawfully striking workers has been resolved, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. The Secretary shall publish or cause to be published, in the Federal Register, the names of contractors that have, in the judgement of the Secretary, permanently replaced lawfully striking employees and have been the subject of debarment.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. The Secretary shall be responsible for the administration and enforcement of this order. The Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the General Services, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, may adopt such rules and regulations and issue such orders as may be deemed necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. Each contracting department and agency shall cooperate with the Secretary and provide such information and assistance as the Secretary may require in the performance of the Secretary's functions under this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. The Secretary may delegate any function or duty of the Secretary under this order to any officer in the Department of Labor or to any other officer in the executive branch of the Government, with the consent of the head of the department or agency in which that officer serves.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9. The Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the General Services, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, after consultation with the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, shall take whatever action is appropriate to implement the provisions of this order and of any related rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary issued pursuant to this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 10. This order is not intended, and should not be construed, to create any right or benefit, substantive <!-- PDFPage:17 -->or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or its employees. This order is not intended, however, to preclude judicial review of final agency decisions in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 <em>et seq.</em></p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 11. The meaning of the term &ldquo;organizational unit of a Federal contractor&rdquo; as used in this order shall be defined in regulations that shall be issued by the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with affected agencies. This order shall apply only to contracts in excess of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 12. (a) The provisions of section 3 of this order shall only apply to situations in which contractors have permanently replaced lawfully striking employees after the effective date of this order.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Disposing of Unneeded Federal Real Estate&mdash;Increasing Sales Proceeds, Cutting Operating Costs, and Improving Energy Efficiency</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, June 10, 2010, 75 F.R. 33987, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">My Administration is committed to eliminating all forms of Government waste and to leading by example as our Nation transitions to a clean energy economy. For decades, the Federal Government, the largest property owner and energy user in the United States, has managed more real estate than necessary to effectively support its programs and missions. Both taxpayer dollars and energy resources are being wasted to maintain these excess assets. In addition, many of the properties necessary for the Government's work are not operated efficiently, resulting in wasted funds and excessive greenhouse gas pollution. For example, over the past decade, the private sector reduced its data center footprint by capitalizing on innovative technologies to increase efficiencies. However, during that same period, the Federal Government experienced a substantial increase in the number of data centers, leading to increased energy consumption, real property expenditures, and operations and maintenance costs. Past attempts at reducing the Federal Government's civilian real property assets produced small savings and had a minor impact on the condition and performance of mission-critical properties. These efforts were not sufficiently comprehensive in disposing of excess real estate and did not emphasize making more efficient use of existing assets.</p>
<p class="note-body">To eliminate wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars, save energy and water, and further reduce greenhouse gas pollution, I hereby direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to accelerate efforts to identify and eliminate excess properties. Agencies shall also take immediate steps to make better use of remaining real property assets as measured by utilization and occupancy rates, annual operating cost, energy efficiency, and sustainability. To the extent permitted by law, agency actions shall include accelerating cycle times for identifying excess assets and disposing of surplus assets; eliminating lease arrangements that are not cost effective; pursuing consolidation opportunities within and across agencies in common asset types (such as data centers, office space, warehouses, and laboratories); increasing occupancy rates in current facilities through innovative approaches to space management and alternative workplace arrangements, such as telework; and identifying offsetting reductions in inventory when new space is acquired. Agency actions taken under this memorandum shall align with and support the actions to measure and reduce resource use and greenhouse gas emissions in Federal facilities pursuant to Executive Order 13514 of October 5, 2009 (Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance), and the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative, which was announced by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in February 2010.</p>
<p class="note-body">In total, agency efforts required by this memorandum should produce no less than $3 billion in cost savings by the end of fiscal year 2012, yielded from increased proceeds from the sale of assets and reduced operating, maintenance, and energy expenses from disposals or other space consolidation efforts, including leases that are ended. This is in addition to the Department of Defense's Base Realignment and Closure efforts that are expected to achieve $9.8 billion in savings from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2012, of which $5 billion is a direct result of reduced operating and maintenance from disposals or other consolidation efforts. In addition, in order to address the growth of data centers across the Federal Government, agencies shall immediately adopt a policy against expanding data centers beyond current levels, and shall develop plans to consolidate and significantly reduce data centers within 5 years. Agencies <!-- PDFPage:20 -->shall submit their plans to OMB for review by August 30, 2010.</p>
<p class="note-body">To achieve these goals, the Director of the OMB shall develop, in consultation with the Administrator of General Services and the Federal Real Property Council established pursuant to Executive Order 13327 of February 4, 2004 (Federal Real Property Asset Management), within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, guidance for actions agencies should take to carry out the requirements of this memorandum. The guidance shall include agency-specific targets to achieve $3 billion in cost savings and shall be developed in consultation with the agencies. The Administrator of General Services, in consultation with the Director of the OMB, shall coordinate agency efforts to satisfy the requirements of this memorandum and shall submit to the President periodic reports on the results achieved.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of the OMB is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="presidential-signature">Barack Obama.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 18 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. The plan transfers to the Administrator of General Services the functions of the various Federal agencies with respect to leasing and assigning general-purpose space in buildings and the operation, maintenance, and custody of office buildings. Since such authority is already largely concentrated in the General Services Administration with respect to the District of Columbia, the plan principally relates to the administration of these functions in the field.</p>
<p class="note-body">The transfers made by this plan will promote more economical leasing, better utilization of building space, and more efficient operation of Government-controlled office buildings. They will effectuate the recommendations of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government with respect to concentrating in the General Services Administration the responsibility for space allotment and the operation of Government buildings outside of the District of Columbia. Likewise, they will extend the principles laid down by the Congress in enacting the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to another important area of Government-wide administrative services&mdash;the administration of Government office buildings and general-purpose building space in the field.</p>
<p class="note-body">Within the District of Columbia, one agency, the Public Buildings Service of the General Services Administration, has long had the operation and custody of most Government buildings and the leasing and assignment of space for executive agencies. Thus, nearly all requests for building space are handled by a single organization which is responsible for seeing that agencies are properly and efficiently housed. This arrangement has proved its worth and has repeatedly been approved by the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">Outside of the National Capital, however, responsibility for the acquisition and control of building space and the operation of Government buildings is widely diffused. A variety of agencies operate and control general-purpose buildings. If quarters are not available in Federal buildings, each agency ordinarily does its own leasing. As a result, in some cases Federal agencies have contracted for space at high rentals at the very time that other agencies have been giving up surplus low-cost space.</p>
<p class="note-body">The assignment of space in Government-owned buildings outside of Washington is also divided among a number of agencies. While the Public Buildings Service constructs a large part of the Government buildings, it operates and controls the assignment of space in only a small proportion of them. The Post Office Department operates and allocates the space in post-office buildings, several hundred of which contain substantial amounts of office space available for other agencies. During and immediately after the war several other Federal agencies acquired office buildings in the field. As their activities have contracted, surplus space in many of these structures has become available for other uses.</p>
<p class="note-body">This plan concentrates in the General Services Administration the responsibility for the leasing and assignment of what is termed general-purpose building space; that is, space which is suitable for the uses of a number of Federal agencies. It specifically excludes space in buildings at military posts, arsenals, navy yards, and similar defense installations and space in hospitals, laboratories, factories, and other special-purpose buildings.</p>
<p class="note-body">Also, the plan excludes the Post Office Department from the transfer of leasing authority since the Department has a highly developed organization for this purpose, and it limits the transfer of space assignment authority in post-office buildings to the space not occupied by the Department. Further, it gives the needs of the Post Office Department priority in the assignment of space in post-office buildings. Thus, the plan amply safeguards the interests of the Post Office Department while making it possible to include the general office space in post-office buildings in any given city with other similar space under Federal control in planning and executing an efficient program for housing Government agencies in that area.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition, the plan transfers to the General Services Administration the operation, maintenance, and custody of office buildings owned or leased by the Government, including those post-office buildings which are not used predominantly for post-office purposes. This will make it possible to establish a single organization for the operation and maintenance of Government office buildings in principal cities in the field as has proved desirable in the National Capital. Since many post offices are in fact primarily large office buildings, the plan includes in this transfer the post-office buildings which are not used predominantly for post-office purposes. This will relieve the Post Office Department of a considerable expenditure for building operation and maintenance which properly should not be charged against postal revenues.</p>
<p class="note-body">While the plan effects a broad transfer of functions with respect to leasing and assignment of space and the operation and maintenance of office buildings, it specifically authorizes the Administrator of General Services to delegate the performance of any part of these functions to other agencies subject to such regulations as he deems desirable for economical and effective administration. In this the plan follows the pattern adopted by the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 for other branches of property management. In large urban centers where numerous Federal units are located unified administration of space activities by the General Services Administration will normally be advantageous. On the other hand, in the smaller communities it will no doubt be desirable to delegate the work back to the agencies directly affected, to be carried on under standards laid down by the Administrator of General Services. The plan provides ample flexibility for working out the most effective administrative arrangement for each type of situation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The fundamental soundness and economy of centralized administration of building space have been amply demonstrated in the National Capital. By virtue of unified control it has been possible since the war to accomplish far-reaching changes which have consolidated agencies in much fewer locations, released many of the rented buildings, and greatly reduced the cost of housing the Government establishment. Similar procedures applied in the larger centers of field activity should produce substantial savings.</p>
<p class="note-body">After investigation, I have found, and hereby declare, that each reorganization contained in this plan is nec<!-- PDFPage:24 -->essary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body">While it is not possible at this time to calculate the reduction in expenditures which will result from this plan, it can safely be predicted that it will produce substantial savings. I am confident that this reorganization plan will constitute a significant improvement in Federal business practice and will bring about an important increase in efficiency in housing Government agencies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) under subsection (b) or (d); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by abandonment, destruction, or donation or through a contract broker.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Time, method, and terms</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The time, method, and terms and conditions of advertisement must permit full and free competition consistent with the value and nature of the property involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Public disclosure</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Bids must be publicly disclosed at the time and place stated in the advertisement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Awards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An award shall be made with reasonable promptness by notice to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the invitation for bids, is most advantageous to the Federal Government, price and other factors considered. However, all bids may be rejected if it is in the public interest to do so.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Negotiated Disposal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Under regulations the Administrator prescribes, disposals and contracts for disposal may be negotiated without regard to subsection (a), but subject to obtaining competition that is feasible under the circumstances, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) necessary in the public interest&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) during the period of a national emergency declared by the President or Congress, with respect to a particular lot of personal property; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for a period not exceeding three months, with respect to a specifically described category of personal property as determined by the Administrator;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the public health, safety, or national security will be promoted by a particular disposal of personal property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) public exigency will not allow delay incident to advertising certain personal property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the nature and quantity of personal property involved are such that disposal under subsection (a) would impact an industry to an extent that would adversely affect the national economy, and the estimated fair market value of the property and other satisfactory terms of disposal can be obtained by negotiation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the estimated fair market value of the property involved does not exceed $15,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) after advertising under subsection (a), the bid prices for the property, or part of the property, are not reasonable or have not been independently arrived at in open competition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) with respect to real property, the character or condition of the property or unusual circumstances make it impractical to advertise publicly for competitive bids and the fair market value of the property and other satisfactory terms of disposal can be obtained by negotiation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the disposal will be to a State, territory, or possession of the United States, or to a political subdivision of, or a tax-supported agency in, a State, territory, or possession, and the estimated fair market value of the property and other satisfactory terms of disposal are obtained by negotiation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) otherwise authorized by law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Disposal Through Contract Brokers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Disposals and contracts for disposal of surplus real and related personal property through contract realty brokers employed by the Administrator shall be made in the manner followed in similar commercial transactions under regulations the Administrator prescribes.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Authorization</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may make a negotiated sale of personal property at a fixed price, either directly or through the use of a disposal contractor, without regard to subsection (a). However, the sale must be publicized to an extent consistent with the value and nature of the property involved and the price established must reflect the estimated fair market value of the property. Sales under this subsection are limited to categories of personal property for which the Administrator determines that disposal under this subsection best serves the interests of the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>First offer</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Under regulations and restrictions the Administrator prescribes, an opportunity to purchase property at a fixed price under this subsection may be offered first to an entity specified in subsection (b)(8) that has expressed an interest in the property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Explanatory Statements for Negotiated Disposals.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) real property or real and related personal property disposed of by exchange, regardless of value, or any property for which any part of the consideration is real property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An explanatory statement is not required for a disposal of personal property under subsection (d), or for a disposal of real or personal property authorized by any other law to be made without advertising.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Transmittal to congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The explanatory statement shall be transmitted to the ap<!-- PDFPage:41 -->propriate committees of Congress in advance of the disposal, and a copy of the statement shall be preserved in the files of the executive agency making the disposal.</p>

<p class="note-body">In order to ensure that American children have the skills they need to succeed in the information-intensive 21st century, the Federal Government is committed to working with the private sector to promote four major developments in American education: making modern computer technology an integral part of every <!-- PDFPage:45 -->classroom; providing teachers with the professional development they need to use new technologies effectively; connecting classrooms to the National Information Infrastructure; and encouraging the creation of excellent educational software. This Executive order streamlines the transfer of excess and surplus Federal computer equipment to our Nation's classrooms and encourages Federal employees to volunteer their time and expertise to assist teachers and to connect classrooms.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the provisions of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, as amended (15 U.S.C. 3701 <em>et seq.</em>), the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, ch. 288, 63 Stat. 377 [now chapters 1 to 11 of this title and division C (except sections 3302, 3307(e), 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of Title 41, Public Contracts], and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Public Law 104&ndash;106 [see Tables for classification], it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Protection of Educationally Useful Federal Equipment</em>. (a) Educationally useful Federal equipment is a vital national resource. To the extent such equipment can be used as is, separated into parts for other computers, or upgraded&mdash;either by professional technicians, students, or other recycling efforts&mdash;educationally useful Federal equipment is a valuable tool for computer education. Therefore, to the extent possible, all executive departments and agencies (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;agencies&rdquo;) shall protect and safeguard such equipment, particularly when declared excess or surplus, so that it may be recycled and transferred, if appropriate, pursuant to this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Efficient Transfer of Educationally Useful Federal Equipment to Schools and Nonprofit Organizations</em>.

<p class="note-body">(c) Each agency shall, to the extent permitted by law and where appropriate, identify educationally useful Federal equipment that it no longer needs and transfer it to a school or nonprofit organization by:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) conveying research equipment directly to the school or organization pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 3710(i); or</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) reporting excess equipment to the General Services Administration (GSA) for donation when declared surplus in accordance with section 203(j) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 484(j) [now 40 U.S.C. 549]. Agencies shall report such equipment as far as possible in advance of the date the equipment becomes excess, so that GSA may attempt to arrange direct transfers from the donating agency to recipients eligible under this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) In transfers made pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, title shall transfer directly from the agency to the schools or nonprofit organizations as required by 15 U.S.C. 3710(i). All such transfers shall be reported to the GSA. At the direction of the recipient institution or organization, and if appropriate, transferred equipment may be conveyed initially to a nonprofit reuse or recycling program that will upgrade it before transfer to the school or nonprofit organization holding title.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) All transfers to schools or nonprofit organizations, whether made directly or through GSA, shall be made at the lowest cost to the school or nonprofit organization permitted by law.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) The availability of educationally useful Federal equipment shall be made known to eligible recipients under this order by all practicable means, including newspaper, community announcements, and the Internet.</p>

<p class="note-body">(1) help connect America's classrooms to the National Information Infrastructure;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) assist teachers in learning to use computers to teach; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) provide ongoing maintenance of and technical support for the educationally useful Federal equipment transferred pursuant to this order.</p>

The plan shall be consistent with approved agency budget totals and shall be coordinated through the Office of Science and Technology Policy.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Nothing in this order shall be interpreted to bar a recipient of educationally useful Federal equipment from lending that equipment, whether on a permanent or temporary basis, to a teacher, administrator, student, employee, or other designated person in furtherance of educational goals.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Definitions</em>. For the purposes of this order: (a) &ldquo;Schools&rdquo; means individual public or private education institutions encompassing prekindergarten through twelfth grade, as well as public school districts.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Community-based educational organizations&rdquo; means nonprofit entities that are engaged in collaborative projects with schools or that have education as their primary focus.

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Judicial Review</em>.

<h4 class="note-head">Facilitating Access to Federal Property for Siting of Mobile Services Antennas</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Aug. 10, 1995, 60 F.R. 42023, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">Recent advancements in mobile telecommunications technology present an opportunity for the rapid construction of the Nation's wireless communications infrastructure. As a matter of policy, the Federal Government shall encourage the efficient and timely implementation of such new technologies and the concomitant infrastructure buildout as a means of stimulating economic growth and creating new jobs. The recent auctioning and impending licensing of radio frequencies for mobile personal communications services presents the Federal Government with the opportunity to foster new technologies and to encourage the development of communications infrastructure by making Federal property available for the siting of mobile services antennas.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, I hereby direct the Administrator of General Services, within 90 days, in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Interior, Defense, and the heads of such other agencies as the Administrator may determine, to develop procedures necessary to facilitate appropriate access to Federal property for the siting of mobile services antennas.</p>
<p class="note-body">The procedures should be developed in accordance with the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. (a) Upon request, and to the extent permitted by law and where practicable, executive departments and agencies shall make available Federal Government buildings and lands for the siting of mobile service antennas. This should be done in accordance with Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, and consistent with national security concerns (including minimizing mutual electromagnetic interactions), public health and safety concerns, environmental and aesthetic concerns, preservation of historic buildings and monuments, protection of natural and cultural resources, protection of national park and wilderness values, protection of National Wildlife Refuge systems, and subject to any Federal requirements promulgated by the agency managing the facility and the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and other relevant departments and agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Antennas on Federal buildings or land may not contain any advertising.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Federal property does not include lands held by the United States in trust for individual or Native American tribal governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Agencies shall retain discretion to reject inappropriate siting requests, and assure adequate protection of public property and timely removal of equipment and structures at the end of service.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. All procedures and mechanisms adopted regarding access to Federal property shall be clear and simple so as to facilitate the efficient and rapid buildout of the national wireless communications infrastructure.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. Unless otherwise prohibited by or inconsistent with Federal law, agencies shall charge fees based on market value for siting antennas on Federal property, and may use competitive procedures if not all applicants can be accommodated.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum does not give the siting of mobile services antennas priority over other authorized uses of Federal buildings or land.</p>
<p class="note-body">All independent regulatory commissions and agencies are requested to comply with the provisions of this memorandum.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum is not intended to create any right, benefit or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>

Sections 3 and 4 of the Public Buildings Amendments of 1972 (Public Law 92&ndash;313, 86 Stat. 218) added subsection (j) of 40:490 (in which the words &ldquo;the fund&rdquo; appear) and amended subsection (f) to create a fund into which &ldquo;charges made pursuant to subsection (j)&rdquo; are deposited (40:490(f)(1)(A)).

Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 does not contain a subsection (j) and the intended reference was probably &ldquo;section 210(j)&rdquo;, which is restated in this section.

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 10579, Dec. 1, 1954, 19 F.R. 7925, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Purpose and general policy</em>. (a) The purpose of these regulations is to establish policies and procedures under which interagency motor-vehicle pools or systems may be established, operated, curtailed, or discontinued.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Administrator of General Services (hereinafter referred to as the Administrator) shall establish and provide for the operation of interagency motor-vehicle pools and systems for the purpose of providing more efficient or economical transportation of Government personnel and property within specific areas by motor vehicles or local transit systems. Pools or systems based in whole or in part upon use of privately-owned vehicles and facilities shall be preferred to Government ownership of vehicles and facilities to the extent that it is feasible to provide required motor-vehicle services of satisfactory quality and cost from commercial or other private sources.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Conduct of studies to determine advisability of establishing motor-vehicle pools or systems</em>. (a) The Administrator shall select areas in which studies are to be conducted to determine the advisability of establishing motor-vehicle pools or systems. Before initiating any such study, he shall give at least thirty days notice to the head of each executive agency (as defined in section 3(a) of the Act [now 40 U.S.C. 102(4)]). The notice shall include a statement of the approximate geographic area to be studied and the date on which the study will begin.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The head of each executive agency receiving notice that such a study is to be made shall provide information which is required or pertinent. He shall also designate one or more officials in the field with whom members of a staff assigned by the General Services Administration may consult. Such designated officials shall provide such assigned staff with needed information and assistance, including reasonable opportunities to observe motor-vehicle operations and facilities and to examine pertinent cost and other records.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Determination to establish an interagency motor-vehicle pool or system</em>. (a) If the Administrator determines, with due regard to the program activities of the agencies concerned, and on the basis of a study made in accordance with section 2 hereof, that an interagency motor-vehicle pool or system should be established, he shall be responsible for preparing a formal determination to that effect. Such determination shall include:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) A description of the proposed operation, including a statement of the types of service and of the geographic area, and the agencies or parts of agencies to be served.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The name of the executive agency designated to be responsible for operating the pool or system, and the reasons for such designation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) A statement indicating the motor vehicles and related equipment and supplies to be transferred and the amount of reimbursement, if any, to be made therefor.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Each determination shall be accompanied by an analytical justification which shall include a comparison of estimated costs of the present and proposed methods of operation and a showing of the estimated savings to be realized through the establishment of the proposed pool or system. The justification shall also describe the alternatives considered in making the determination, and shall include a statement concerning the availability of privately-owned facilities and equipment, and the feasibility and estimated cost (immediate and long-term) of using such facilities and equipment.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Administrator shall send a copy of each determination to each executive agency affected and to the Director of the Bureau of the Budget [now the Director of the Office of Management and Budget] (hereinafter referred to as the Director).</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Transfers of records, facilities, personnel, and appropriations</em>. Whenever the Administrator prepares a determination as set forth in section 3 of these regulations, he shall also prepare and present to the Director a schedule of the proposed transfer of such records, facilities, personnel, and appropriations as relate primarily to the functions which are to be transferred to the interagency motor-vehicle pool or system. A copy of such schedule shall be sent by the Administrator to each executive agency affected. The Director shall determine the records, facilities, personnel, and appropriations to be transferred.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Taking effect of determinations</em>. Unless a greater time is allowed therein, any determination made by the Administrator shall become binding on all affected executive agencies forty-five days after the issuance thereof except with respect to any agency which appeals, or requests an exemption, from any such determination in accordance with section 6 of these regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Review of determinations not agreed to by agencies affected</em>. (a) Any executive agency may appeal or request exemption from any or all proposals affecting it which are contained in a determination. Appeals shall be submitted in writing to the Director with a copy to the Administrator within forty-five days from the date of the determination. Such appeals shall be accompanied by factual and objective supporting data and justification.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Director shall review any determination from which an executive agency has appealed and shall make a final decision on such appeal. The Director shall make such decisions, within seventy-five days after he receives the appeal or as soon thereafter as practicable, on the basis of information contained in the Administrator's determination, the executive agencies&rsquo; appeals therefrom, and any supplementary data submitted by the Administrator and the contesting agencies. The Director shall send copies of decisions to the Adminis<!-- PDFPage:68 -->trator and to the heads of other executive agencies concerned.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Director's decision upon each such appeal, if it holds that the determination shall apply in whole or in part to the appealing agency, shall state the extent to which the determination applies and the effective date of its application. To the extent that the Director's decision on an appeal does not uphold the Administrator's determination, such determination shall be of no force and effect.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Compliance with determinations and decisions on appeals</em>. (a) When a determination or a decision on an appeal made in accordance with these regulations has become effective, each executive agency affected shall comply therewith.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Director shall take such actions as he deems appropriate to assist in securing compliance with determinations which have become effective. In the exercise of this authority to establish reserves in apportioning appropriations and funds, the Director shall take account of such savings as accrue from the establishment of inter-agency motor-vehicle pools and systems.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The executive agency which operates any pool or system established hereunder shall maintain accurate records of the cost of establishment, maintenance, and operation of any interagency motor-vehicle pool or system established pursuant to these regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The Administrator shall be responsible for maintaining adequate reviews and controls of the economy and efficiency of all pools or systems established in accordance with these regulations, including those not directly operated by the General Services Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. <em>Discontinuance or curtailment of service</em>. (a) If, during any reasonable period, not exceeding two successive fiscal years, no actual savings are realized from the operation of any pool or system established hereunder, the Administrator shall discontinue the pool or system concerned.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Administrator may discontinue or curtail a motor-vehicle pool or system when he determines that it is not the most economical method of rendering required motor-vehicle service; but he shall give at least sixty days notice of such intention to executive agencies affected and to the Director before taking such action.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Executive agencies affected by a pool or system for which the Administrator is responsible (including inter-agency pools or systems operated by another executive agency designated by the Administrator) may bring problems of service and cost to the attention of the Administrator, who shall assure that such problems receive proper attention.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Executive agencies receiving motor-vehicle services from an interagency motor-vehicle pool or system under these regulations may request discontinuance or curtailment of their participation in such pool or system after at least one year of participation or in the event that the need for the services from the pool or system ceases. Such requests shall be submitted to the Administrator with pertinent factual justification.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) If the Administrator does not agree with such request and is unable to make arrangements which are mutually acceptable to him and to the head of the executive agency concerned, the agency's request for discontinuance or modification and the Administrator's reasons for not agreeing with the request shall be forwarded to the Director who shall be responsible for making a final and binding decision.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) When a pool or system is discontinued or curtailed, such transfers of vehicles and related equipment and supplies, personnel, records, facilities, and funds as may be appropriate will be made, subject to the approval of the Director.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9. <em>Motor vehicles exempted from inclusion in interagency motor-vehicle pools</em>. The following-described classes of motor vehicles shall be exempt from inclusion in interagency motor-vehicle pools or systems:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Motor vehicles designed or used for military field training, combat, or tactical purposes, or used principally within the confines of a regularly established military post, camp, or depot.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Any motor vehicle regularly used by an agency in the performance of investigative, law enforcement, or intelligence duties if the head of such agency determines that exclusive control of such vehicle is essential to the effective performance of such duties: <em>Provided</em>, that vehicles regularly used for common administrative purposes not directly connected with the performance of law enforcement, investigative, or intelligence duties shall not because of such use be exempted from such inclusion.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Any motor vehicle the conspicuous identification of which as a Government vehicle would interfere with the purpose for which it is acquired and used.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) Unless inclusion is mutually agreed upon by the Administrator and the head of the agency concerned:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) Motor vehicles for the use of the heads of the executive agencies, ambassadors, ministers, charge [sic] d'affaires, and other principal diplomatic and consular officials.</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) Motor vehicles regularly and principally used for the transportation of diplomats and representatives of foreign countries or by officers of the Department of State for the conduct of official business with representatives of foreign countries.</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) Motor vehicles regularly used for the distribution and transportation of mails.</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) Motor vehicles which, because of their design or the special purposes for which they are used, or for other reasons, cannot advantageously be incorporated in an interagency motor-vehicle pool or system if the exemption thereof has been mutually agreed upon by the Administrator and the head of the executive agency concerned.</p>
<p class="note-body">(6) Motor vehicles exempted by an agency which has authority to make such an exemption under the provisions of the Act [probably means the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, now chapters 1 to 11 of this title and division C (except sections 3302, 3307(e), 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of Title 41, Public Contracts].</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 10. <em>Optional use arrangements</em>. Nothing in these regulations shall be construed as precluding the establishment or operation of interagency motor-vehicle pools or systems on the basis of optional use by executive or other Federal agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 11. <em>Supplementary regulations</em>. The Administrator shall, after consultation with the executive agencies concerned and with due regard to their program activities, issue such supplementary regulations of general applicability to the executive agencies concerned as are necessary for the effective and economical operation of pools or systems under the Act [probably means the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949].</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Actions of administrator</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the President, on the recommendation of the Administrator of General Services, or the federal agency having control of any real property the agency acquires that is located outside of the District of Columbia, other than military or naval reservations, declares the property to be surplus to the needs of the agency, the Administrator&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may assign space in the property to any federal agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) pending a sale, may lease the property for not more than 5 years and on terms the Administrator considers to be in the public interest; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may sell the property at public sale to the highest responsible bidder on terms and after public advertisement that the Administrator considers to be in the public interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Review of decision to assign space</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the federal agency to which space is assigned does not desire to occupy the space, the decision of the Administrator under paragraph (1)(A) is subject to review by the President.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Negotiated sale</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If no bids which are satisfactory as to price and responsibility of the bidder are received as a result of public advertisement, the Administrator may sell the property by negotiation, on terms as may be considered to be to the best interest of the Government, but at a price not less than that bid by the highest responsible bidder.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Demolition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may demolish any building declared to be surplus to the needs of the Government under this section on deciding that demolition will be in the best interest of the Government. Before proceeding with the demolition, the Administrator shall inform the Secretary of the Interior in writing of the Administrator's intention to demolish the building, and shall not proceed with the demolition until receiving written notice from the Secretary that the building is not an historic building of national significance within the meaning of the Act of August 21, 1935 (16 U.S.C. 461 et seq.) (known as the Historic Sites, Buildings, and Antiquities Act). If the Secretary does not notify the Administrator of the Secretary's decision as to whether the building is an historic building of national significance within 90 days of the receipt of the notice of intention to demolish the building, the Administrator may proceed to demolish the building.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Repairs and Alterations to Assigned Real Property</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the Administrator, after investigation, decides that real property referred to in subsection (b) should be used for the accommodation of a federal agency, the Administrator may make any repairs or alterations that the Administrator considers necessary or advisable and may maintain and operate the property.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Assigned real property</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To the extent that the appropriations of the General Services Administration not otherwise allocated are inadequate for repairs, alterations, maintenance, or operation, the Administrator may require each federal agency to which space has been assigned to pay promptly by check to the Administrator out of its appropriation for rent any part of the estimated or actual cost of the repairs, alterations, maintenance, and operation. Payment may be either in advance of, or on or during, occupancy of the space. The Administrator shall determine and equitably apportion the total amount to be paid among the agencies to whom space has been assigned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Leased spaces</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To the extent that the appropriations of the Administration not otherwise required are inadequate, the Administrator may require each federal agency to which leased space has been assigned to pay promptly by check to the Administrator out of its available appropriations any part of the estimated cost of rent, repairs, alterations, maintenance, operation, and moving. Payment may be either in advance or during occupancy of the space. When space in a building is occupied by two or more agencies, the Administrator shall determine and equitably apportion rental, operation, and other charges on the basis of the total amount of space leased.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Authorization of Appropriations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Necessary amounts may be appropriated to cover the costs incident to the sale or lease of real property, or authorized demolition of buildings on the property, declared to be surplus to the needs of any federal agency under this section, and the care, maintenance, and protection of the property, including pay of employees, travel of Government employees, brokers&rsquo; fees not in excess of rates paid for similar services in the community where the property is situated, appraisals, photographs, surveys, evidence of title and perfecting of defective titles, advertising, and telephone and telegraph charges. However, the agency remains responsible for the proper care, maintenance, and protection of the property until the Administrator assumes custody or other disposition of the property is made.</p>
