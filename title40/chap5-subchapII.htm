<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Reports of inspectors; determination of amount of unpaid wages and liquidated damages; authorization for direct payments by Comptroller General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any officer or person designated as inspector of the work to be performed under any contract of the character specified in section 329 of this title, or to aid in the enforcement or fulfillment thereof shall, upon observation or investigation, forthwith report to the proper officer of the United States, of any territory or possession, or of the District of Columbia, all violations of the provisions of this subchapter occurring in the performance of such work, together with the name of each laborer or mechanic who was required or permitted to work in violation of such provisions and the day or days of such violation. The amount of unpaid wages and liquidated damages owing under the provisions of this subchapter shall be administratively determined and the officer or person whose duty it is to approve the payment of moneys by the United States, the territory, or the District of Columbia in connection with the performance of the contract work shall direct the amount of such liquidated damages to be withheld for the use and benefit of the United States, said territory, or said District, and shall direct the amount of such unpaid wages to be withheld for the use and benefit of the laborers and mechanics who were not compensated as required under the provisions of this subchapter. The Comptroller General of the United States is authorized and directed to pay directly to such laborers and mechanics, from the sums withheld on account of underpayments of wages, the respective amounts administratively determined to be due, if the funds withheld are adequate, and, if not, an equitable proportion of such amounts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rights of action and intervention against contractors and sureties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the accrued payments withheld under the terms of the contracts, as aforesaid, are insufficient to reimburse all the laborers and mechanics with respect to whom there has been a failure to pay the wages required pursuant to this subchapter, such laborers and mechanics shall, in the case of a department or agency of the Federal Government, have the rights of action and/or of intervention against the contractor and his sureties conferred by law upon persons furnishing labor or materials, and in such proceedings it shall be no defense that such laborers and mechanics accepted or agreed to accept less than the required rate of wages or voluntarily made refunds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Right of contractors to appeal; limitations; administrative determination; review by Secretary and issuance of final decision; filing claim in United States Court of Federal Claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contractor or subcontractor aggrieved by the withholding of a sum as liquidated damages as provided in this subchapter shall have the right, within sixty days thereafter, to appeal to the head of the agency of the United States or of the territory for which the contract work is done or by which financial assistance for the work is provided, or to the Mayor of the District of Columbia in the case of liquidated damages withheld for the use and benefit of said District. Such agency head or Mayor, as the case may be, shall have authority to review the administrative determination of liquidated damages and to issue a final order affirming such determination; or, if it is found that the sum determined is incorrect or that the contractor or subcontractor violated the provisions of this subchapter inadvertently notwithstanding the exercise of due care on his part and that of his agents, recommendations may be made to the Secretary that an appropriate adjustment in liquidated damages be made, or that the contractor or subcontractor be relieved of liability for such liquidated damages. The Secretary shall review all pertinent facts in the matter and may conduct such investigations as he deems necessary, so as to affirm or reject the recommendation. The decision of the Secretary shall be final. In all such cases in which a contractor or subcontractor may be aggrieved by a final order for the withholding of liquidated damages as hereinbefore provided, such contractor or subcontractor may, within sixty days after such final order, file a claim in the United States Court of Federal Claims: <em>Provided, however</em>, That final orders of the agency head, the Mayor of the District of Columbia or the Secretary, as the case may be, shall be conclusive with respect to findings of fact if such findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Applicability of other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Reorganization Plan Numbered 14 of 1950 (64 Stat. 1267) shall be applicable with respect to the provisions of this subchapter, and section 276c of this title, shall be applicable with respect to those contractors and subcontractors referred to therein who are engaged in the performance of contracts subject to the provisions of this subchapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">It shall be a condition of each contract (other than a contract referred to in section 329(c) of this title) which is entered into under legislation subject to Reorganization Plan Numbered 14 of 1950 (64 Stat. 1267), and is for construction, alteration, and/or repair, including painting and decorating, that no contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part of the contract work shall require any laborer or mechanic employed in the performance of the contract to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to his health or safety, as determined under construction safety and health standards promulgated by the Secretary by regulation based on proceedings pursuant to section 553 of title 5, provided that such proceedings include a hearing of the nature authorized by said section. In formulating such standards, the Secretary shall consult with the Advisory Committee created by subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compliance with section and regulations: inspections, hearings, orders, findings of fact, and decisions; application of sections 38 and 39 of title 41; opportunity for hearing; consequences of noncompliance: cancellation of contracts, completion contracts, additional costs, and withholding of assistance; nonapplication of section 330 of this title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to make such inspections, hold such hearings, issue such orders, and make such decisions based on finding of fact, as are deemed necessary to gain compliance with this section and any health and safety standard promulgated by the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section, and for such purposes the Secretary and the United States district courts shall have the authority and jurisdiction provided by sections 38 and 39 of title 41. In the event that the Secretary of Labor determines noncompliance under the provisions of this section after an opportunity for an adjudicatory hearing by the Secretary of any condition of a contract of a type described in clause (1) or (2) of section 329(a) of this title, the governmental agency for which the contract work is done shall have the right to cancel the contract, and to enter into other contracts for the completion of the contract work, charging any additional cost to the original contractor. In the event of noncompliance, as determined by the Secretary after an opportunity for an adjudicatory hearing by the Secretary, of any condition of a contract of a type described in clause (3) of section 329(a) of this title, the governmental agency by which financial guarantee, assistance, or insurance for the contract work is provided shall have the right to withhold any such assistance attributable to the performance of the contract. Section 330 of this title shall not apply to the enforcement of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Jurisdiction; cause shown; enforcement of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The United States district courts shall have jurisdiction for cause shown, in any actions brought by the Secretary, to enforce compliance with the construction safety and health standard promulgated by the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Finding of ineffective protection against violations; transmission of names of violators to Comptroller General; contract awards prohibition; termination of restriction and notification of Comptroller General and Government agencies; judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Secretary determines on the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing that, by repeated willful or grossly negligent violations of this subchapter, a contractor or sub<!-- PDFPage:146 -->contractor has demonstrated that the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section are not effective to protect the safety and health of his employees, the Secretary shall make a finding to that effect and shall, not sooner than thirty days after giving notice of the findings to all interested persons, transmit the name of such contractor or subcontractor to the Comptroller General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Comptroller General shall distribute each name so transmitted to him to all agencies of the Government. Unless the Secretary otherwise recommends, no contract subject to this section shall be awarded to such contractor or subcontractor or to any person in which such contractor or subcontractor has a substantial interest until three years have elapsed from the date the name is transmitted to the Comptroller General. If, before the end of such three-year period, the Secretary, after affording interested persons due notice and opportunity for hearing, is satisfied that a contractor or subcontractor whose name he has transmitted to the Comptroller General will thereafter comply responsibly with the requirements of this section, shall terminate the application of the preceding sentence to such contractor or subcontractor (and to any person in which the contractor or subcontractor has a substantial interest); and when the Comptroller General is informed of the Secretary's action he shall inform all agencies of the Government thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any person aggrieved by the Secretary's action under subsections (b) or (d) of this section may, within sixty days after receiving notice thereof, file with the appropriate United States court of appeals a petition for review of such action. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary, who shall thereupon file in the court the record upon which he based his action, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. The findings of fact by the Secretary, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be final. The court shall have power to make and enter a decree enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part, the order of the Secretary or the appropriate Government agency. The judgment of the court shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall establish in the Department of Labor an Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Advisory Committee&rdquo;) consisting of nine members appointed, without regard to the civil service laws, by the Secretary.
