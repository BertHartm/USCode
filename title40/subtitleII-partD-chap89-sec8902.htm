<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the text of 40:1002(a) and (b) is omitted as unnecessary because the complete names of the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of General Services are used the first time the terms appear in a section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(3), the words &ldquo;notwithstanding any other provision of law&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;Administrator of General Services&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;General Services Administration&rdquo; because of section 101(b) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 379), which is restated as section 302(a) of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;January 3, 1985&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the commencement of the Ninety-ninth Congress&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
