Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the decision of the Secretary of the Treasury that such loss, destruction, or damage has occurred or that such shipment was made substantially in accordance with such regulations shall be final and conclusive and shall not be subject to review by any other officer of the United States: <em>Provided, however</em>, That where the Secretary of the Treasury determines that such replacement can be effected, in whole or in part, without actual or ultimate injury to the United States, by a credit in the accounts of the executive department, independent establishment, agency, officer, employee, or other accountable person making the claim, he shall not resort to the fund, except to the extent that such replacement cannot be so effected by such credit, but shall certify such determination to the Comptroller General and, upon receipt of such certification, the Comptroller General is authorized and directed to make such credit in the settlement of accounts in the General Accounting Office: <em>Provided further</em>, That the fund shall be available for the replacement of any loss or destruction of, or damage to, valuables shipped by or on behalf of the Bureau of the Public Debt of the Treasury Department prior to the effective date of this amendment, the replacement of which was chargeable against the securities trust fund established under authority of section 3129 of title 31; and the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby authorized and directed to transfer on the books of the Treasury Department the amount standing to the credit of the securities trust fund and credit the same to the fund. <em>And provided further</em>, That the fund shall not be available with respect to any loss, destruction, or damage affecting valuables, insofar as such loss, destruction, or damage relates to property of the United States Postal Service chargeable to its officers or employees; nor shall it be available with respect to any loss, destruction, or damage affecting valuables of which shipment shall have been made at the risk of persons other than the United States, its executive departments, independent establishments, agencies, wholly owned corporations, officers, and employees. All recoveries and repayments on account of loss, destruction, or damage to valuables of which replacement shall have been made out of the fund shall be credited to it and shall be available for the purposes thereof.</p>
