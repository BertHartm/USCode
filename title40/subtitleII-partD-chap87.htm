<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the location of the seat of government in the District of Columbia has brought about the development of a metropolitan region extending well into adjoining territory in Maryland and Virginia;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) effective comprehensive planning is necessary on a regional basis and of continuing importance to the federal establishment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the distribution of federal installations throughout the region has been and will continue to be a major influence in determining the extent and character of development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) there is needed a central planning agency for the National Capital region to coordinate certain developmental activities of the many different agencies of the Federal and District of Columbia Governments so that those activities may conform with general objectives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) there is an increasing mutuality of interest and responsibility between the various levels of government that calls for coordinate and unified policies in planning both federal and local development in the interest of order and economy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) there are developmental problems of an interstate character, the planning of which requires collaboration between federal, state, and local governments in the interest of equity and constructive action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the instrumentalities and procedures provided in this chapter will aid in providing Congress with information and advice requisite to legislation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this chapter (except sections 8733&ndash;8736) are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to secure comprehensive planning for the physical development of the National Capital and its environs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to provide for the participation of the appropriate planning agencies of the environs in the planning; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to establish the agency and procedures requisite to the administration of the functions of the Federal and District Governments related to the planning.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Objective</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The general objective of this chapter (except sections 8733&ndash;8736) is to enable appropriate agencies to plan for the development of the federal establishment at the seat of government in a manner&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) consistent with the nature and function of the National Capital and with due regard for the rights and prerogatives of the adjoining States and local governments to exercise control appropriate to their functions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which will, in accordance with present and future needs, best promote public health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity, and the general welfare, as well as efficiency and economy in the process of development.</p>

The words &ldquo;Office of Management and Budget&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Bureau of the Budget&rdquo; in section 13 of the Act of June 6, 1924, because the Bureau of the Budget was redesignated the Office of Management and Budget by section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, 84 Stat. 2085). Section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 was repealed by section 5(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982 (Public Law 97&ndash;258, 96 Stat. 1085), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States Code, but the successor provision, 31:501, continued the designation as Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (h), the words &ldquo;beginning in fiscal year 1998 and thereafter&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Preparation and Adoption by Commission</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The National Capital Planning Commission shall prepare and adopt a comprehensive, consistent, and coordinated plan for the National Capital. The plan shall include the Commission's recommendations or proposals for federal developments or projects in the environs and District elements of the comprehensive plan, or amendments to the elements, adopted by the Council of the District of Columbia and with respect to which the Commission has not determined a negative impact exists. Those elements or amendments shall be incorporated into the comprehensive plan without change. The Commission may include in its plan any part of a plan adopted by any planning agency in the environs and may make recommendations of collateral interest to the agencies. The Commission may adopt any part of an element. The Commission shall review and may amend or extend the plan so that its recommendations may be kept up to date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Review by District of Columbia</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Mayor of the District of Columbia shall submit each District element of the comprehensive plan, and any amendment, to the Council for revision or modification, and adoption, by act, following public hearings.

If the Commission does not act within the 60-day period, the modified element or amendment is deemed to have no negative impact and shall be incorporated into the comprehensive plan and implemented. If the Commission finds a negative impact, it shall certify its findings (in sufficient detail that the Council can understand the basis of the objection of the Commission) and recommendations to the Council and the element or amendment shall not be implemented.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Resubmission Deemed New Element or Amendment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any element or amendment which the Commission has determined has a negative <!-- PDFPage:164 -->impact on the federal establishment in the National Capital which is submitted again in a modified form not less than one year from the day it was last rejected by the Commission is deemed to be a new element or amendment for purposes of the review procedure specified in this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before the comprehensive plan, any element of the plan, or any revision is adopted, the Commission shall present the plan, element, or revision to the appropriate federal or District of Columbia authorities for comment and recommendations.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Government agencies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In order that the National Capital may be developed in accordance with the comprehensive plan, the Commission, with the consent of each agency concerned as to its representation, may establish advisory and coordinating committees composed of representatives of agencies of the Federal and District of Columbia Governments as may be necessary or helpful to obtain the maximum amount of cooperation and correlation of effort among the various agencies. As it considers appropriate, the Commission may invite representatives of the planning and developmental agencies of the environs to participate in the work of the committees.</p>
