<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided by subsection (c) of this section, no executive agency shall dispose of any plant, plants, or other property to any private interest until such agency has received the advice of the Attorney General on the question whether such disposal would tend to create or maintain a situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws. Whenever any such disposal is contemplated by any executive agency, such agency shall transmit promptly to the Attorney General notice of such proposed disposal and the probable terms or conditions thereof. If such notice is given by any executive agency other than the General Services Administration, a copy of <!-- PDFPage:202 -->such notice shall be transmitted simultaneously to the Administrator. Within a reasonable time, in no event to exceed sixty days, after receipt of such notification, the Attorney General shall advise the Administrator and any other interested executive agency whether, so far as he can determine, the proposed disposition would tend to create or maintain a situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws.</p>
