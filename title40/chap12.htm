Through the Administration's community empowerment initiatives, the Federal Government has undertaken various efforts to revitalize our central cities, which have historically served as the centers for growth and commerce in our metropolitan areas. Accordingly, the Administration hereby reaffirms the commitment set forth in Executive Order No. 12072 to strengthen our Nation's cities by encouraging the location of Federal facilities in our central cities. The Administration also reaffirms the commitments set forth in the National Historic Preservation Act to provide leadership in the preservation of historic resources, and in the Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976 to acquire and utilize space in suitable buildings of historic, architectural, or cultural significance.</p>
<p class="note-body">To this end, the Federal Government shall utilize and maintain, wherever operationally appropriate and economically prudent, historic properties and districts, especially those located in our central business areas. When implementing these policies, the Federal Government shall institute practices and procedures that are sensible, understandable, and compatible with current authority and that impose the least burden on, and provide the maximum benefit to, society.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Encouraging the Location of Federal Facilities on Historic Properties in Our Central Cities</em>. When operationally appropriate and economically prudent, and subject to the requirements of section 601 of title VI of the Rural Development Act of 1972, as amended (42 U.S.C. 3122), and Executive Order No. 12072, when locating Federal facilities, Federal agencies shall give first consideration to historic properties within historic districts. If no such property is suitable, then Federal agencies shall consider other developed or undeveloped sites within historic districts. Federal agencies shall then consider historic properties outside of historic districts, if no suitable site within a district exists. Any rehabilitation or construction that is undertaken pursuant to this order must be architecturally compatible with the character of the surrounding historic district or properties.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Identifying and Removing Regulatory Barriers</em>. Federal agencies with responsibilities for leasing, acquiring, locating, maintaining, or managing Federal facilities or with responsibilities for the planning for, or managing of, historic resources shall take steps to reform, streamline, and otherwise minimize regulations, policies, and procedures that impede the Federal Government's ability to establish or maintain a presence in <!-- PDFPage:231 -->historic districts or to acquire historic properties to satisfy Federal space needs, unless such regulations, policies, and procedures are designed to protect human health and safety or the environment. Federal agencies are encouraged to seek the assistance of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation when taking these steps.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Improving Preservation Partnerships</em>. In carrying out the authorities of the National Historic Preservation Act, the Secretary of the Interior, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and each Federal agency shall seek appropriate partnerships with States, local governments, Indian tribes, and appropriate private organizations with the goal of enhancing participation of these parties in the National Historic Preservation Program. Such partnerships should embody the principles of administrative flexibility, reduced paperwork, and increased service to the public.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order is not intended to create, nor does it create, any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

Such terms and conditions shall include provision for the application to the purchase price agreed upon therein of installment payments made thereunder. Each purchase contract authorized by this section shall be entered into pursuant to the provisions of title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended [41 U.S.C. 251 et seq.]. If any such contract is negotiated, the determination and findings supporting such negotiation shall be promptly reported in writing to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives.

No such purchase contract shall provide for any payments to be made by the United States in excess of the amount necessary, as determined by the Administrator, to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) amortize the cost of construction of improvements to be constructed plus the fair market value, on the date of the agreement, of the site, if not owned by the United States; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) State and local taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to any interest in real property acquired under the provisions of this section, the same shall be subject to State and local taxes until title to the same shall pass to the Government of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Agreements to effectuate purposes; development and improvement of land; construction of projects previously approved; increase of estimated maximum cost</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of purchase contracts provided for in this section for the erection by the contractor of buildings and improvements for the use of the United States, the Administrator is authorized to enter into agreements with any person, copartnership, corporation, or other public or private entity, to effectuate any of the purposes of this section; and is further authorized to bring about the development and improvement of any land owned by the United States and under the control of the General Services Administration including the demolition of obsolete and outmoded structures situated thereon, by providing for the construction thereon by others of such structures and facilities as shall be the subject of the applicable purchase contracts, and by making available such plans and specifications for the construction of a public building thereon as the Government may possess. Projects heretofore approved pursuant to the provisions of this chapter may be constructed under authority of this section without further approval, and the prospectuses submitted to obtain such approval shall for all <!-- PDFPage:232 -->purposes, be considered as prospectuses for the purchase of space, except that any such project shall be subject to the requirements of section 606(b) of this title, based upon an estimated maximum cost increased by not more than an average of 10 per centum per year, exclusive of financing or other costs attributable to the use of the method of construction authorized by this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Submission and approval of prospectus as prerequisite; exceptions; procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except for previously approved prospectuses referred to in subsection (e) of this section, no purchase contract shall be entered into pursuant to the authority of this section until a prospectus therefor has been submitted and approved in accordance with section 606 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Expiration of contracting authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No purchase contract shall be entered into under the authority granted under this section after the end of the third fiscal year which begins after June 16, 1972.</p>
