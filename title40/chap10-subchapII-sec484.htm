<p class="statutory-body">A deed, bill of sale, lease, or other instrument executed by or on behalf of any executive agency purporting to transfer title or any other interest in surplus property under this subchapter shall be conclusive evidence of compliance with the provisions of this subchapter insofar as concerns title or other interest of any bona fide grantee or transferee for value and without notice of lack of such compliance.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Transfers for donation of property to State agencies; State plan of operation; &ldquo;public agency&rdquo; and &ldquo;State&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Under such regulations as he may prescribe, the Administrator is authorized in his discretion to transfer, without cost (except for costs of care and handling), any personal property under the control of any executive agency which has been determined to be surplus property to the State agency in each State designated under State law as the agency responsible for the fair and equitable distribution, through donation, of all property transferred in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection. In determining whether the property is to be transferred for donation under this subsection, no distinction shall be made between property capitalized in a working-capital fund established under section 2208 of title 10, or any similar fund, and any other property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of surplus personal property under the control of the Department of Defense, the Secretary of Defense shall determine whether such property is usable and necessary for educational activities which are of special interest to the armed services, such as maritime academies, or military, naval, Air Force, or Coast Guard preparatory schools. If the Secretary determines that such property is usable and necessary for said purposes, the Secretary shall allocate it for transfer by the Administrator to the appropriate State agency for distribution, through donation, to such educational activities. If the Secretary determines that such property is not usable and necessary for such purposes, it may be disposed of in accordance with paragraph (3) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except for surplus personal property transferred pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Administrator shall, pursuant to criteria which are based on need and utilization and established after such consultation with State agencies as is feasible, allocate such property among the States in&nbsp;<sup><a href="#484_1_target" name="484_1">1</a></sup> a fair and equitable basis (taking into account the condition of the property as well as the original acquisition cost thereof), and transfer to the State agency property selected by it for distribution through donation within the State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to any public agency for use in carrying out or promoting for the residents of a given political area one or more public purposes, such as conservation, economic development, education, parks and recreation, public health, and public safety; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Before property may be transferred to any State agency, such State shall develop, according to State law, a detailed plan of operation, developed in conformity with the provisions of this subsection, which shall include adequate assurance that the State agency has the necessary organizational and operational authority and capability, including staff, facilities, means and methods of financing, and procedures with respect to: accountability, internal and external audits, cooperative agreements, compliance and utilization reviews, equitable distribution and property disposal, determination of eligibility, and assistance through consultation with advisory bodies and public and private groups. The chief executive officer shall certify and submit the plan to the Administrator. In the event that a State legislature has not developed, according to State law, a State plan within two hundred and seventy calendar days after October 17, 1976, the chief executive officer of the State shall approve, and submit to the Administrator, a temporary State plan. No such plan, and no major amendment thereof, shall be filed with the Administrator until sixty days after general notice of the proposed plan or amendment has been published and interested persons have been given at least thirty days during which to submit comments. In developing and implementing the State plan, the relative needs and resources of all public agencies and other eligible institutions within the State shall be taken into consideration.

<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) The State plan of operation shall require the State agency to utilize a management control system and accounting system for donable property transferred under this section of the same types as are required by State law for State-owned property, except that the State agency, with the approval of the chief executive officer of the State, may elect, in lieu of such systems, to utilize such other management control and accounting systems as are effective to govern the utilization, inventory control, accountability, and disposal of property under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The State plan of operation shall require the State agency to provide for the return of donable property for further distribution if such property, while still usable, has not been placed in use for the purpose for which it was donated within one year of donation or ceases to be used by the donee for such purposes within one year of being placed in use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The State plan shall require the State agency, insofar as practicable, to select property requested by a public agency or other eligible institution within the State and, if so requested by the recipient, to arrange shipment of that property, when acquired, directly to the recipient.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Where the State agency is authorized to assess and collect service charges from participating recipients to cover direct and reasonable indirect costs of its activities, the method of establishing such charges shall be set out in the State plan of operation. Such charges shall be fair and equitable and shall be based on services performed by the State agency, including, but not limited to, screening, packing, crating, removal, and transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) The State plan of operation shall provide that the State agency may impose reasonable terms, conditions, reservations, and restrictions on the use of property to be donated under paragraph (3) of this subsection and shall impose such terms, conditions, reservations, and restrictions in the case of any passenger motor vehicle and any item of other property having a unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more. If the Administrator finds that an item or items have characteristics that require special handling or use limitations, he may impose appropriate conditions on the donation of such property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) The State plan of operation shall provide that surplus property which the State agency determines cannot be utilized by eligible recipients shall be disposed of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) subject to the disapproval of the Administrator within thirty days after notice to him, through transfer by the State agency to another State agency or through abandonment or destruction where the property has no commercial value or the estimated cost of its continued care and handling would exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) otherwise pursuant to the provisions of this Act under such terms and conditions and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Administrator.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding sections 485 and 512(c) of this title, the Administrator, from the proceeds of sale of any such property, may reimburse the State agency for such expenses relating to the care and handling of such property as he shall deem appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) As used in this subsection, (A) the term &ldquo;public agency&rdquo; means any State, political subdivision thereof (including any unit of local government or economic development district), or any department, agency, instrumentality thereof (including instrumentalities created by compact or other agreement between States or political subdivisions), or any Indian tribe, band, group, pueblo, or community located on a State reservation and (B) the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; means the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa.</p>
