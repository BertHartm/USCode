<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;or a majority thereof&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;section 1 of the Act of December 23, 1963 (Public Law 88&ndash;241, 77 Stat. 572)&rdquo; are substituted for 40:72 (2d sentence words after &ldquo;in accordance with&rdquo;) because provisions in section 3 of the Act of August 30, 1890 (ch. 837, 26 Stat. 412), established the act as permanent and general. The act therefore was classified to 40:120, which was superseded by the Act of March 1, 1929 (ch. 416, 45 Stat. 1415), which was classified to 40:361 et seq. That law was repealed by section 21(b) of the Act of December 23, 1963 (Public Law 88&ndash;241, 77 Stat. 627), with the subject matter of those sections being restated in section 1 of that Act.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(2), the words &ldquo;in Maryland or Virginia&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;outside the District of Columbia&rdquo; for clarity and for consistency in this section. The words &ldquo;such agreements to be subject to the approval of the President&rdquo; are omitted because of 40:72 (last sentence), restated as subsection (d).</p>
