<p class="note-body">Before clause (1), the words &ldquo;this chapter&rdquo; were in the original &ldquo;this title&rdquo;, meaning title XV (&sect;&sect;15101 to 15313) of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (Public Law 99&ndash;272, 100 Stat. 330). In clause (2)(B), the words &ldquo;this chapter&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;this part&rdquo; as the probable intent of Congress because title XV of the Act does not contain part designations and the intention was probably to refer to title XV, which is restated as this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) affordable public transportation is essential to the economic vitality of the national capital area and is an essential component of regional efforts to improve air quality to meet environmental requirements and to improve the health of both residents of and visitors to the national capital area as well as to preserve the beauty and dignity of the Nation's capital;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) use of mass transit by both residents of and visitors to the national capital area is substantially affected by the prices charged for mass transit services, prices that are substantially affected by labor costs, since more than two-thirds of operating costs are attributable to labor costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) labor costs incurred in providing mass transit in the national capital area have increased at an alarming rate and wages and benefits of operators and mechanics currently are among the highest in the Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) higher operating costs incurred for public transit in the national capital area cannot be offset by increasing costs to patrons, since this often discourages ridership and thus undermines the public interest in promoting the use of public transit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) spiraling labor costs cannot be offset by the governmental entities that are responsible for subsidy payments for public transit services since local governments generally, and the District of Columbia government in particular, are operating under severe fiscal constraints;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) imposition of mandatory standards applicable to arbitrators resolving arbitration disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area will ensure that wage increases are justified and do not exceed the ability of transit patrons and taxpayers to fund the increase; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) federal legislation is necessary under section 8 of Article I of the United States Constitution to balance the need to moderate and lower labor costs while maintaining industrial peace.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of this chapter is to adopt standards governing arbitration that must be applied by arbitrators resolving disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area in order to lower operating costs for public transportation in the Washington metropolitan area.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the average per capita tax burden, during the term of the collective bargaining agreement to which the arbitration relates, of the residents of the Washington metropolitan area, and the effect of an arbitration award rendered under that arbitration on the respective income or property tax rates of the jurisdictions that provide subsidy payments to the interstate compact agency established under the compact.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Factors in Making Arbitration Award</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An arbitrator rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area may not make a finding or a decision for inclusion in a collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment without considering the following factors:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) All available financial resources of the interstate compact agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The annual increase or decrease in consumer prices for goods and services as reflected in the most recent consumer price index for the Washington metropolitan area, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The interests and welfare of the employees in the bargaining unit, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the overall compensation presently received by the employees, having regard not only for wage rates but also for wages for time not worked, including vacations, holidays, and other excused absences;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Ability To Finance Salaries and Benefits Provided in Award</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An arbitrator rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area may not, with respect to a collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment, provide for salaries and other benefits that exceed the ability of the interstate compact agency, or of any governmental jurisdiction that provides subsidy payments or budgetary assistance to the interstate compact agency, to obtain the necessary financial resources to pay for wage and benefit increases for employees of the interstate compact agency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Written award</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In resolving a dispute submitted to arbitration involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area, the arbitrator shall issue a written award that demonstrates that all the factors set forth in subsections (b) and (c) have been considered and applied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Prerequisites</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An award may grant an increase in pay rates or benefits (including insurance and pension benefits), or reduce hours of work, only if the arbitrator concludes that <!-- PDFPage:234 -->any costs to the agency do not adversely affect the public welfare.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Substantial evidence</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The arbitrator's conclusion regarding the public welfare must be supported by substantial evidence.</p>
