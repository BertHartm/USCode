<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Photovoltaic Energy Commercialization Program.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of General Services may establish a photovoltaic energy commercialization program for the procurement and installation of photovoltaic solar electric systems for electric production in new and existing public buildings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of the program shall be to accomplish the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) To accelerate the growth of a commercially viable photovoltaic industry to make this energy system available to the general public as an option which can reduce the national consumption of fossil fuel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) To reduce the fossil fuel consumption and costs of the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) To attain the goal of installing solar energy systems in 20,000 Federal buildings by 2010, as contained in the Federal Government's Million Solar Roof Initiative of 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) To stimulate the general use within the Federal Government of life-cycle costing and innovative procurement methods.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) To develop program performance data to support policy decisions on future incentive programs with respect to energy.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Acquisition of photovoltaic solar electric systems.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The program shall provide for the acquisition of photovoltaic solar electric systems and associated storage capability for use in public buildings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Acquisition levels</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The acquisition of photovoltaic electric systems shall be at a level substantial enough to allow use of low-cost production techniques with at least 150 megawatts (peak) cumulative acquired during the 5 years of the program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Administration</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall administer the program and shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) issue such rules and regulations as may be appropriate to monitor and assess the performance and operation of photovoltaic solar electric systems installed pursuant to this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) develop innovative procurement strategies for the acquisition of such systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) transmit to Congress an annual report on the results of the program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Photovoltaic Systems Evaluation Program.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this section, the Administrator shall establish a photovoltaic solar energy systems evaluation program to evaluate such photovoltaic solar energy systems as are required in public buildings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Program requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In evaluating photovoltaic solar energy systems under the program, the Administrator shall ensure that such systems reflect the most advanced technology.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:95 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Authorization of Appropriations.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Photovoltaic energy commercialization program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out subsection (a) $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2006 through 2010. Such sums shall remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Photovoltaic systems evaluation program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out subsection (b) $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2006 through 2010. Such sums shall remain available until expended.</p>
