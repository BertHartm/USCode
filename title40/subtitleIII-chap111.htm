<p class="note-body">A Government that works better and costs less requires efficient and effective information systems. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 [44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.] and the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 [now Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, div. D (&sect;&sect;4001&ndash;4402) and div. E (&sect;&sect;5001&ndash;5703) of Pub. L. 104&ndash;106, see Tables for classification] provide the opportunity to improve significantly the way the Federal Government acquires and manages information technology. Agencies now have the clear authority and responsibility to make measurable improvements in mission performance and service delivery to the public through the strategic application of information technology. A coordinated approach that builds on existing structures and successful practices is needed to provide maximum benefit across the Federal Government from this technology.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>.

<p class="note-body">(b) refocus information technology management to support directly their strategic missions, implement an investment review process that drives budget formulation and execution for information systems, and rethink and restructure the way they perform their functions before investing in information technology to support that work;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) establish clear accountability for information resources management activities by creating agency Chief Information Officers (CIOs) with the visibility and management responsibilities necessary to advise the agency head on the design, development, and implementation of those information systems. These responsibilities include: (1) participating in the investment review process for information systems; (2) monitoring and evaluating the performance of those information systems on the basis of applicable performance measures; and, (3) as necessary, advising the agency head to modify or terminate those systems;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) cooperate in the use of information technology to improve the productivity of Federal programs and to promote a coordinated, interoperable, secure, and shared Governmentwide infrastructure that is provided and supported by a diversity of private sector suppliers and a well-trained corps of information technology professionals; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) establish an interagency support structure that builds on existing successful interagency efforts and shall provide expertise and advice to agencies; expand the skill and career development opportunities of information technology professionals; improve the management and use of information technology within and among agencies by developing information technology procedures and standards and by identifying and sharing experiences, ideas, and promising practices; and provide innovative, multi-disciplinary, project-specific support to agencies to enhance interoperability, minimize unnecessary duplication of effort, and capitalize on agency successes.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Responsibilities of Agency Heads</em>. The head of each executive agency shall: (a) effectively use information technology to improve mission performance and service to the public;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) strengthen the quality of decisions about the employment of information resources to meet mission needs through integrated analysis, planning, budgeting, and evaluation processes, including:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) determining, before making investments in new information systems, whether the Government should <!-- PDFPage:169 -->be performing the function, if the private sector or another agency should support the function, and if the function needs to be or has been appropriately redesigned to improve its efficiency;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) establishing mission-based performance measures for information systems investments, aligned with agency performance plans prepared pursuant to the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (Public Law 103&ndash;62);</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) establishing agency-wide and project-level management structures and processes responsible and accountable for managing, selecting, controlling, and evaluating investments in information systems, with authority for terminating information systems when appropriate;</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) supporting appropriate training of personnel; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) seeking the advice of, participating in, and supporting the interagency support structure set forth in this order;</p>

<p class="note-body">(e) where appropriate, and in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and guidance to be issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), structure major information systems investments into manageable projects as narrow in scope and brief in duration as practicable, consistent with the Information Technology Act, to reduce risk, promote flexibility and interoperability, increase accountability, and better correlate mission need with current technology and market conditions; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) to the extent permitted by law, enter into a contract that provides for multiagency acquisitions of information technology as an executive agent for the Government, if and in the manner that the Director of OMB considers it advantageous to do so.</p>

Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
