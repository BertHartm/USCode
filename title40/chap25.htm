The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 [44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.] and the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 [now Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, see Short Title note above] provide the opportunity to improve significantly the way the Federal Government acquires and manages information technology. Agencies now have the clear authority and responsibility to make measurable improvements in mission performance and service delivery to the public through the strategic application of information technology. A coordinated approach that builds on existing structures and successful practices is needed to provide maximum benefit across the Federal Government from this technology.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>.

<p class="note-body">(b) refocus information technology management to support directly their strategic missions, implement an investment review process that drives budget formulation and execution for information systems, and rethink and restructure the way they perform their functions before investing in information technology to support that work;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) establish clear accountability for information resources management activities by creating agency Chief Information Officers (CIOs) with the visibility and management responsibilities necessary to advise the agency head on the design, development, and implementation of those information systems. These responsibilities include: (1) participating in the investment review process for information systems; (2) monitoring and evaluating the performance of those information systems on the basis of applicable performance measures; and, (3) as necessary, advising the agency head to modify or terminate those systems;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) cooperate in the use of information technology to improve the productivity of Federal programs and to promote a coordinated, interoperable, secure, and shared Governmentwide infrastructure that is provided and supported by a diversity of private sector suppliers and a well-trained corps of information technology professionals; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) establish an interagency support structure that builds on existing successful interagency efforts and shall provide expertise and advice to agencies; expand the skill and career development opportunities of information technology professionals; improve the management and use of information technology within and among agencies by developing information technology procedures and standards and by identifying and shar<!-- PDFPage:312 -->ing experiences, ideas, and promising practices; and provide innovative, multi-disciplinary, project-specific support to agencies to enhance interoperability, minimize unnecessary duplication of effort, and capitalize on agency successes.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Responsibilities of Agency Heads</em>. The head of each executive agency shall: (a) effectively use information technology to improve mission performance and service to the public;</p>

<p class="note-body">(1) determining, before making investments in new information systems, whether the Government should be performing the function, if the private sector or another agency should support the function, and if the function needs to be or has been appropriately redesigned to improve its efficiency;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) establishing mission-based performance measures for information systems investments, aligned with agency performance plans prepared pursuant to the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (Public Law 103&ndash;62);</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) establishing agency-wide and project-level management structures and processes responsible and accountable for managing, selecting, controlling, and evaluating investments in information systems, with authority for terminating information systems when appropriate;</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) supporting appropriate training of personnel; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) seeking the advice of, participating in, and supporting the interagency support structure set forth in this order;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) select CIOs with the experience and skills necessary to accomplish the duties set out in law and policy, including this order, and involve the CIO at the highest level of the agency in the processes and decisions set out in this section;</p>

<p class="note-body">(e) where appropriate, and in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and guidance to be issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), structure major information systems investments into manageable projects as narrow in scope and brief in duration as practicable, consistent with the Information Technology Act, to reduce risk, promote flexibility and interoperability, increase accountability, and better correlate mission need with current technology and market conditions; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) to the extent permitted by law, enter into a contract that provides for multiagency acquisitions of information technology as an executive agent for the Government, if and in the manner that the Director of OMB considers it advantageous to do so.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Standards and guidelines</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of Commerce shall, on the basis of standards and guidelines developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 278g&ndash;3(a) of title 15, promulgate standards and guidelines pertaining to Federal computer systems. The Secretary shall make such standards compulsory and binding to the extent to which the Secretary determines necessary to improve the efficiency of operation or security and privacy of Federal computer systems. The President may disapprove or modify such standards and guidelines if the President determines such action to be in the public interest. The President's authority to disapprove or modify such standards and guidelines may not be delegated. Notice of such disapproval or modification shall be published promptly in the Federal Register. Upon receiving notice of such disapproval or modification, the Secretary of Commerce shall immediately rescind or modify such standards or guidelines as directed by the President.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exercise of authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The authority conferred upon the Secretary of Commerce by this section shall be exercised subject to direction by the President and in coordination with the Director to ensure fiscal and policy consistency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application of more stringent standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The head of a Federal agency may employ standards for the cost-effective security and privacy of sensitive information in a Federal computer system within or under the supervision of that agency that are more stringent than the standards promulgated by the Secretary of Commerce under this section, if such standards contain, at a minimum, the provisions of those applicable standards made compulsory and binding by the Secretary of Commerce.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Waiver of standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The standards determined under subsection (a) of this section to be compulsory and binding may be waived by the Secretary of Commerce in writing upon a determination that compliance <!-- PDFPage:320 -->would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal computer system, or cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Government-wide savings. The Secretary may delegate to the head of one or more Federal agencies authority to waive such standards to the extent to which the Secretary determines such action to be necessary and desirable to allow for timely and effective implementation of Federal computer system standards. The head of such agency may redelegate such authority only to a Chief Information Officer designated pursuant to section 3506 of title 44. Notice of each such waiver and delegation shall be transmitted promptly to Congress and shall be published promptly in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section, the terms &ldquo;Federal computer system&rdquo; and &ldquo;operator of a Federal computer system&rdquo; have the meanings given such terms in section 278g&ndash;3(d) of title 15.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Provide basic information on prices, features, and performance of all products and services available for ordering through the multiple award schedules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Provide for updating that information to reflect changes in prices, features, and performance as soon as information on the changes becomes available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Enable users to make on-line computer comparisons of the prices, features, and performance of similar products and services offered by various vendors.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The system for providing on-line computer access shall be used to place orders under the multiple award schedules in a fiscal year for an amount equal to at least 60 percent of the total amount spent for all orders under the multiple award schedules in that fiscal year.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:325 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Streamlined procedures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Pilot program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon certification by the Administrator of General Services that the system for providing on-line computer access meets the requirements of subsection (b)(1) of this section and was used as required by subsection (b)(2) of this section in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which the certification is made, the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy may establish a pilot program to test streamlined procedures for the procurement of information technology products and services available for ordering through the multiple award schedules.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Applicability to multiple award schedule contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (4), the pilot program shall be applicable to all multiple award schedule contracts for the purchase of information technology and shall test the following procedures:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A procedure under which negotiation of the terms and conditions for a covered multiple award schedule contract is limited to terms and conditions other than price.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) agrees to establish and update prices, features, and performance and to accept orders electronically through the automated system established pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Comptroller General review and report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Not later than three years after the date on which the pilot program is established, the Comptroller General of the United States shall review the pilot program and report to the Congress on the results of the pilot program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The report shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) An evaluation of the extent to which there is competition for the orders placed under the pilot program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The effect that the streamlined procedures under the pilot program have on prices charged under multiple award schedule contracts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The effect that such procedures have on paperwork requirements for multiple award schedule contracts and orders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) The impact of the pilot program on small businesses and socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Withdrawal of schedule or portion of schedule from pilot program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator may withdraw a multiple award schedule or portion of a schedule from the pilot program if the Administrator determines that (A) price competition is not available under such schedule or portion thereof, or (B) the cost to the Government for that schedule or portion thereof for the previous year was higher than it would have been if the contracts for such schedule or portion thereof had been awarded using procedures that would apply if the pilot program were not in effect. The Administrator shall notify Congress at least 30 days before the date on which the Administrator withdraws a schedule or portion thereof under this paragraph. The authority under this paragraph may not be delegated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Termination of pilot program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Unless reauthorized by law, the authority of the Administrator to award contracts under the pilot program shall expire four years after the date on which the pilot program is established. Contracts entered into before the authority expires shall remain in effect in accordance with their terms notwithstanding the expiration of the authority to award new contracts under the pilot program.</p>
