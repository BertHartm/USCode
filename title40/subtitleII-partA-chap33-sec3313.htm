<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In making a determination under this section concerning the feasibility of installing a lighting fixture or bulb that is energy efficient, the Administrator shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the life-cycle cost effectiveness of the fixture or bulb;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the compatibility of the fixture or bulb with existing equipment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) whether use of the fixture or bulb could result in interference with productivity;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the fixture or bulb is certified under the Energy Star program established by section 324A of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6294a);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of all light-emitting diode (LED) luminaires, lamps, and systems whose efficacy (lumens per watt) and Color Rendering Index (CRI) meet the Department of Energy requirements for minimum luminaire efficacy and CRI for the Energy Star certification, as verified by an independent third-party testing laboratory that the Administrator and the Secretary of Energy determine conducts its tests according to the procedures and recommendations of the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, even if the luminaires, lamps, and systems have not received such certification; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Administrator and the Secretary of Energy have otherwise determined that the fixture or bulb is energy efficient.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Guidelines</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall develop guidelines for the use of energy efficient lighting technologies that contain mercury in child care centers in public buildings.</p>
