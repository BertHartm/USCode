<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Aug. 10, 1995, 60 F.R. 42023, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">Recent advancements in mobile telecommunications technology present an opportunity for the rapid construction of the Nation's wireless communications infrastructure. As a matter of policy, the Federal Government shall encourage the efficient and timely implementation of such new technologies and the concomitant infrastructure buildout as a means of stimulating economic growth and creating new jobs. The recent auctioning and impending licensing of radio frequencies for mobile personal communications services presents the Federal Government with the opportunity to foster new technologies and to encourage the development of communications infrastructure by making Federal property available for the siting of mobile services antennas.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, I hereby direct the Administrator of General Services, within 90 days, in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Interior, Defense, and the heads of such other agencies as the Administrator may determine, to develop procedures necessary to facilitate appropriate access to Federal property for the siting of mobile services antennas.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:55 --><p class="note-body">The procedures should be developed in accordance with the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. (a) Upon request, and to the extent permitted by law and where practicable, executive departments and agencies shall make available Federal Government buildings and lands for the siting of mobile service antennas. This should be done in accordance with Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, and consistent with national security concerns (including minimizing mutual electromagnetic interactions), public health and safety concerns, environmental and aesthetic concerns, preservation of historic buildings and monuments, protection of natural and cultural resources, protection of national park and wilderness values, protection of National Wildlife Refuge systems, and subject to any Federal requirements promulgated by the agency managing the facility and the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and other relevant departments and agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Antennas on Federal buildings or land may not contain any advertising.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Federal property does not include lands held by the United States in trust for individual or Native American tribal governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Agencies shall retain discretion to reject inappropriate siting requests, and assure adequate protection of public property and timely removal of equipment and structures at the end of service.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. All procedures and mechanisms adopted regarding access to Federal property shall be clear and simple so as to facilitate the efficient and rapid buildout of the national wireless communications infrastructure.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. Unless otherwise prohibited by or inconsistent with Federal law, agencies shall charge fees based on market value for siting antennas on Federal property, and may use competitive procedures if not all applicants can be accommodated.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum does not give the siting of mobile services antennas priority over other authorized uses of Federal buildings or land.</p>
<p class="note-body">All independent regulatory commissions and agencies are requested to comply with the provisions of this memorandum.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum is not intended to create any right, benefit or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including Section 486 of Title 40 of the United States Code [now 40 U.S.C. 121], in order to institute fundamental changes in the manner in which Federal work space is managed to ensure its efficient utilization, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>

In order to make the Federal use of work space (including office space, warehouses and special purpose space, whether federally owned, leased or controlled) and related furnishings more effective in support of agency missions, minimize the acquisition of government resources, and reduce the administrative costs of the Federal government, the heads of all Federal Executive agencies shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Establish programs to reduce the amount of work space, used or held, to that amount which is essential for known agency missions;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Produce and maintain a total inventory of work space and related furnishings and declare excess to the Administrator of General Services all such holdings that are not necessary to satisfy existing or known and verified planned programs;</p>

<p class="note-body">(d) Manage the furniture, equipment, decoration, drapes, carpeting, plants and other accoutrements so that the use of all furnishings by the agency reflects a judicious employment of public moneys;</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Consider, in making decisions concerning the use, acquisition, or disposal of work space and related furnishings, the effects of its actions on costs incurred by other Federal agencies;</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Report all vacant work space retained for future Federal uses to the Administrator of General Services so that it may be made available for the temporary use of other Federal agencies, to the extent consistent with national defense requirements;</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) Establish a work space management plan to meet the provisions of this Order, including specification of <!-- PDFPage:57 -->the goals to be achieved and actions to be taken by the agency in order to improve its utilization of all work space and related furnishings; and</p>

The Administrator of General Services is delegated authority, to the extent not prohibited by other laws, to conduct surveys, establish agency-wide objectives for work space use for each Executive agency, and establish procedures, guidelines and regulations to be followed by the agencies in developing the work space planning, information and reporting systems required by this Order.</p>
