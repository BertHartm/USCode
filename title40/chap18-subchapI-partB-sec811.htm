<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings and Declaration of Policy</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 2 of Pub. L. 97&ndash;125 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Union Station in Washington, District of Columbia, commissioned by Congress in 1903, designed by Daniel H. Burnham in monumental Beaux Arts style, and completed by the Washington Terminal Company in 1907, is an important historic and architectural landmark of the Nation's Capital;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Union Station was built and used exclusively as a rail passenger station until Congress decided to make the historic Union Station building a National Visitor Center in 1968, allocating rail passenger operations to a replacement facility behind the historic building;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the use of rail passenger service to and from Washington, District of Columbia, declining when the National Visitor Center Facilities Act of 1968 [this chapter] was enacted, has dramatically increased since that time with the advent of and substantial Federal investment in the National Railroad Passenger Corporation and the northeast corridor improvement project, justifying a reversal of the policy adopted 13 years ago;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the historic Union Station building is now unsafe and unusable, and the replacement railroad station is inconvenient and inadequate for present and projected rail ridership demand;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) it is in the national interest to preserve the architectural features of Union Station and to provide in the Union Station complex a sound and fully operational transportation terminal;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the Union Station complex and its vicinity present an opportunity for successful commercial development integrated with the transportation functions of the facility; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 1981 Amendment note set out under section 801 of this title] are to achieve the goals of historic preservation and improved rail use of Union Station with maximum reliance on the private sector and minimum requirement for Federal assistance.&rdquo;</p>
