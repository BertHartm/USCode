<p class="note-body">For transfer of functions from the Chief of Engineers to the Director of the National Park Service, see the revision note under section 8102 of this title. The word &ldquo;Mayor&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;Commissioners&rdquo; [meaning the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia] [which subsequently should have been changed to &ldquo;Commissioner&rdquo; (meaning the Commissioner of the District of Columbia) rather than &ldquo;District of Columbia Council&rdquo; because of section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (eff. Nov. 3, 1967, 81 Stat. 951)] because of section 421 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act (Public Law 93&ndash;198, 87 Stat. 789).</p>
