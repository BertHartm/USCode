<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Agency retains property</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An agency that seizes property that has been forfeited to the Government other than by court decree may retain the property and devote it only to official use instead of disposing of the property as otherwise provided by law if competent authority does not order the property returned to any claimant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Notification of administrator</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a proceeding has begun for the forfeiture of any property by court decree, the agency that seized the property immediately shall notify the Administrator and at the same time may file with the Administrator a request for the property for its official use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Application for court order to deliver property.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before entry of a decree, the Administrator shall apply to the court to order delivery of the property in accordance with this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Delivery to seizing agency for temporary holding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If application to the court cannot be made under subparagraph (B) or (C) and the Administrator believes the property may later become necessary to any agency for official use, the Administrator shall apply to the court to order delivery of the property to the agency that seized the property, to be retained in its custody. Within a reasonable time, the Administrator shall order the agency to&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Forfeiture decreed</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If forfeiture is decreed and the property is not ordered by competent authority to be returned to any claimant, the court shall order delivery as provided in paragraph (2).</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Retention or Delivery of Property Deemed Sale</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Retention or delivery of forfeited or abandoned property under this section is deemed to be a sale of the property for the purpose of laws providing for informer's fees or remission or mitigation of a forfeiture. Property acquired under this section when no longer needed for official use shall be disposed of in the same manner as other surplus property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Payment of Costs Related to Property.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;With the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Administrator may require an agency to make a report of all property abandoned to it or seized and the disposal of the property.</p>

<p class="note-body">In this section, the words &ldquo;Administrator&rdquo; and &ldquo;Administrator of General Services&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Director&rdquo; and &ldquo;Director of the Procurement Division of the Treasury Department of the United States&rdquo; [subsequently changed to &ldquo;Bureau of Federal Supply&rdquo; by regulation &sect;5.7 of subpart A of Part 5 of Title 41, Public Contracts, eff. January 1, 1947, 11 F. R. 13636] because of section 102(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 380), which is restated as section 303(a)(1) of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the text of 40:304f(3) is omitted because the complete name of the Administrator of General Services is used the first time the term appears in a section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1), the words &ldquo;(including advertisement for sale, and sale)&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d)(3), the words &ldquo;as provided in paragraph (2)&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;accordingly&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (g), the words &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (h)(2), the words &ldquo;which were enacted prior to August 27, 1935&rdquo; are added for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (h)(3), the text of 40:304m(1) is omitted because section 4 of the Act of June 15, 1917 (22:404) was repealed by section 2 of the Act of August 13, 1953 (ch. 434, 67 Stat. 577). In subclause (C), the words &ldquo;the disposal of which&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;as&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
