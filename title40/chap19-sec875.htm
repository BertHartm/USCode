The interest payments on such obligations may be deferred with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury but any interest payment so deferred shall bear interest. Said obligations shall be issued in amounts and at prices approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.

If the title to the street, road, highway, or alley so closed is not in the United States, the Mayor shall convey title to the land on behalf of the District of Columbia to the Corporation, without cost, except that the Corporation shall reimburse the District of Columbia for the administrative costs of the action: <em>Provided</em>, That if the land would have reverted to a private abutting property owner under otherwise applicable law of the District of Columbia, the Corporation shall pay such owner the fair market value of the land that would have reverted to him.<sup><a href="#875_1_target" name="875_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(20) may transfer title to, interests in, or jurisdiction over real property which has been acquired by the Corporation and is to be de<!-- PDFPage:274 -->voted to public uses under the development plan, to any agency of the United States or the District of Columbia.
