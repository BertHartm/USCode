<h3 class="section-head">&sect;14501. Appalachian development highway system</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To provide a highway system which, in conjunction with the Interstate System and other Federal-aid highways in the Ap<!-- PDFPage:196 -->palachian region, will open up an area with a developmental potential where commerce and communication have been inhibited by lack of adequate access, the Secretary of Transportation may assist in the construction of an Appalachian development highway system and local access roads serving the Appalachian region. Construction on the development highway system shall not be more than 3,025 miles. There shall not be more than 1,400 miles of local access roads that serve specific recreational, residential, educational, commercial, industrial, or similar facilities or facilitate a school consolidation program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Commission Designations.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>What is to be designated</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Appalachian Regional Commission shall transmit to the Secretary its designations of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the general corridor location and termini of the development highways;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) local access roads to be constructed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) priorities for the construction of segments of the development highways; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) other criteria for the program authorized by this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>State transportation department recommendation required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before a state member participates in or votes on designations, the member must obtain the recommendations of the state transportation department of the State which the member represents.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Addition to Federal-aid Primary System</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When completed, each development highway not already on the Federal-aid primary system shall be added to the system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Use of Specific Materials and Products.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Indigenous materials and products</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the construction of highways and roads authorized under this section, a State may give special preference to the use of materials and products indigenous to the Appalachian region.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Coal derivatives</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For research and development in the use of coal and coal products in highway construction and maintenance, the Secretary may require each participating State, to the maximum extent possible, to use coal derivatives in the construction of not more than 10 percent of the roads authorized under this subtitle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Federal Share</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Federal assistance to any construction project under this section shall not be more than 80 percent of the cost of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Construction Without Federal Amounts.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Payment of federal share</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a participating State constructs a segment of a development highway without the aid of federal amounts and the construction is in accordance with all procedures and requirements applicable to the construction of segments of Appalachian development highways with those amounts, except for procedures and requirements that limit a State to the construction of projects for which federal amounts have previously been appropriated, the Secretary, on application by the State and with the approval of the Commission, may pay to the State the federal share, which shall not be more than 80 percent of the cost of the construction of the segment, from any amounts appropriated and allocated to the State to carry out this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>No commitment or obligation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subsection does not commit or obligate the Federal Government to provide amounts for segments of development highways constructed under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Application of Title</cap-smallcap> 23.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Sections 106</cap-smallcap>(a) <cap-smallcap>and 118</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Sections 106(a) and 118 of title 23 apply to the development highway system and the local access roads.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Construction and maintenance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;States are required to maintain each development highway and local access road as provided for Federal-aid highways in title 23. All other provisions of title 23 that are applicable to the construction and maintenance of Federal-aid primary and secondary highways and which the Secretary decides are not inconsistent with this subtitle shall apply to the system and roads, respectively.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Federal grant programs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;federal grant programs&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) means any federal grant program that provides assistance for the acquisition or development of land, the construction or equipment of facilities, or other community or economic development or economic adjustment activities, including a federal grant program authorized by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1921 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 460<em>l</em>&ndash;4 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act (16 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 (20 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) (known as the Clean Water Act);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) title VI of the Public Health Services Act (42 U.S.C. 291 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) sections 201 and 209 of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3141, 3149);</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Certain sewage treatment works deemed constructed with federal grant assistance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For the purpose of this section, any sewage treatment works constructed pursuant to title II of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1281 et seq.)

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To enable the people, States, and local communities of the Appalachian region, including local development districts, to take maximum advantage of federal grant programs for which they are eligible but for which, because of their economic situation, they cannot supply the required matching share, or for which there are insufficient amounts available under the federal law authorizing the programs to meet pressing needs of the region, the Federal Cochairman may use amounts made available to carry out this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for any part of the basic federal contribution to projects or activities under the federal grant programs authorized by federal laws; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to increase the federal contribution to projects and activities under the programs above the fixed maximum part of the cost of the projects or activities otherwise authorized by the applicable law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Certification Required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For a program, project, or activity for which any part of the basic federal contribution to the project or activity under a federal grant program is proposed to be made under subsection (b), the contribution shall not be made until the responsible federal official administering the federal law authorizing the contribution certifies that the program, project, or activity meets the applicable requirements of the federal law and could be approved for federal contribution under that law if <!-- PDFPage:202 -->amounts were available under the law for the program, project, or activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Limitations in Other Laws Inapplicable</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amounts provided pursuant to this subtitle are available without regard to any limitations on areas eligible for assistance or authorizations for appropriation in any other law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Acceptance of Certain Material</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For a supplemental grant for a project or activity under a federal grant program, the Federal Cochairman shall accept any finding, report, certification, or documentation required to be submitted to the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government responsible for the administration of the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Federal Share</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The federal portion of the cost of a project or activity shall not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) be increased to more than the percentages the Commission establishes; nor</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) be more than 80 percent of the cost.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Commission Contribution.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to paragraph (2), the Commission may contribute not more than 50 percent of a project or activity cost eligible for financial assistance under this section from amounts appropriated to carry out this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Distressed counties</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The maximum Commission contribution for a project or activity to be carried out in a county for which a distressed county designation is in effect under section 14526 of this title may be increased to 80 percent.</p>
