<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Transfer of Functions by Director of the Office of Management and Budget.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the Director of the Office of Management and Budget determines that it is in the interest of economy or efficiency, the Director shall transfer to the Administrator all functions vested in a federal agency with respect to the operation, maintenance, and custody of an office building owned by the Government or a wholly owned Government corporation, or an office building, or part of an office building, that is occupied by a federal agency under a lease.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;mixed-ownership Government corporation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;mixed-ownership corporation&rdquo; for consistency in the subsection and with chapter 91 of title 31. The words &ldquo;chapter 91 of title 31&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the Government Corporation Control Act&rdquo; in section 210(b) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, because of section 4(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982 (Public Law 97&ndash;258, 96 Stat. 1067), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;Director of the Office of Management and Budget&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Director of the Bureau of the Budget&rdquo; in section 210(i) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 because the office of Director of the Bureau of the Budget was redesignated the Director of the Office of Management and Budget by section 102(b) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, 84 Stat. 2085). Section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970, was repealed by section 5(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982 (Public Law 97&ndash;258, 96 Stat. 1085), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States Code, but the successor provision, 31:502, continued the designation as Director of the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
