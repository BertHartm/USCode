<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and except as the Administrator of General Services may otherwise provide on recommendation of the head of an affected Federal agency, excess personal property acquired by a Federal agency pursuant to the authority of section 202 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 483) and furnished to and held by a grantee of such agency prior to October 17, 1977, under grants made pursuant to programs established by law shall be regarded as surplus property. The Administrator of General Services upon receipt of a certification by the head of an agency that the property is being used by the grantee for the purposes for which it was furnished shall transfer title to the property to the grantee. The grantor agency shall survey Federal property acquired from excess sources in the possession of its grantees and shall notify the Administrator of General Services, not later than two hundred and forty days from October 17, 1976, of those items of property which are being used by each grantee for the purpose for which it was furnished, and those items which are not being used by each grantee. If the property is not being so used, the Administrator shall transfer such property to an appropriate State agency, upon its request, for distribution in accordance with subsection 203(j) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 484(j)). Property not so transferred shall be otherwise disposed of pursuant to the provisions of that Act [40 U.S.C. 471 et seq.].</p>
