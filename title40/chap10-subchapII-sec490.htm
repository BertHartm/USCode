<p class="statutory-body">At the request of any Federal agency or any mixed-ownership corporation (as defined in chapter 91 of title 31), or the District of Columbia, the Administrator is authorized to operate, maintain, and protect any building owned by the United States (or, in the case of any wholly owned or mixed-ownership Government corporation, by such corporation) and occupied by the agency or instrumentality making such request.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Acquisition of land; surveys; construction services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the request of any Federal agency or any mixed-ownership corporation (as defined in chapter 91 of title 31), or the District of Columbia, the Administrator is authorized (1) to acquire land for buildings and projects authorized by the Congress; (2) to make or cause to be made, under contract or otherwise, surveys and test borings and to prepare plans and specifications for such buildings and projects prior to the approval by the Attorney General of the title to the sites thereof; and (3) to contract for, and to supervise, the construction and development and the equipping of such buildings or projects. Any sum available to any such Federal agency or instrumentality for any such building or project may be transferred by such agency to the General Services Administration in advance for such purposes as the Administrator shall determine to be necessary, including the payment of salaries and expenses of personnel engaged in the preparation of plans and specifications or in field supervision, and for general office expenses to be incurred in the rendition of any such service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Transfer of functions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall determine such action to be in the interest of economy or efficiency, he shall transfer to the Administrator all functions then vested in any other Federal agency with respect to the operation, maintenance, and custody of any office building owned by the United States or any wholly owned Government corporation, or any office building or part thereof occupied by any Federal agency under any lease, except that no transfer shall be made under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) of any post-office building unless the Director shall first determine that such building is not used predominantly for post-office purposes, and functions which are transferred hereunder to the Administrator with respect to any post-office building may be delegated by him only to another officer or employee of the General Services Administration or to the Postmaster General;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) of any building located in any foreign country;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Administrator is authorized, in accordance with policies and directives prescribed by the President under section 486(a) of this title and after consultation with the heads of the executive agencies affected, to assign and reassign space of all executive agencies in Government-owned and leased buildings in and outside the District of Columbia upon a determination by the Administrator that such assignment or reassignment is advantageous to the Government in terms of economy, efficiency, or national security. The Administrator shall, where practicable, give priority in the assignment of space on any major pedestrian access level not leased under the terms of subsection (a)(16) or (a)(17) of this section in such buildings to Federal activities requiring regular contact with members of the public. To the extent such space is unavailable, the Administrator shall provide space with maximum ease of access to building entrances.</p>

The fund shall assume all the liabilities, obligations, and commitments of the said (1) Buildings Management Fund, (2) Construction Services Fund, and (3) the appropriations specified in (C) hereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) There is authorized to be appropriated to the fund for the fiscal year in which the fund becomes operational, and for the succeeding fiscal year, such advances to the fund as may be necessary to carry out its purposes. Such advances shall be repaid within 30 years, with interest at a rate not less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining period to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such advances adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In any fiscal year there may be deposited to miscellaneous receipts in the Treasury of the United States such amount as may be specified in appropriation Acts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Nothing in this section shall preclude the Administrator from providing special services not included in the standard level user charge on a reimbursable basis and such reimbursements may be credited to the fund established under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) The Administrator is authorized to receive amounts from rebates or other cash incentives related to energy savings and shall deposit such amounts in the Federal Buildings Fund for use as provided in subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Administrator may accept, from a utility, goods or services which enhance the energy efficiency of Federal facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In the administration of any real property for which the Administrator leases and pays utility costs, the Administrator may assign all or a portion of energy rebates to the lessor to underwrite the costs incurred in undertaking energy efficiency improvements in such real property if the payback period for such improvement is at least 2 years less than the remainder of the term of the lease.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) encourage employees to participate in recycling programs by providing funding for child care.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Office furniture; movement and supply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever an agency, or an organizational unit thereof, occupying a substantial and identifiable segment of space (building, floor, wing, and so forth) in a location controlled for purposes of assignment of space by the Administrator, is moved to such a substantial and identifiable segment of space in the same or another location so controlled by the Administrator, furniture and furnishings used by the moving agency or unit shall be moved only if the Administrator, after consultation with the head of the agency concerned, and with due regard for the program activities of such agency, shall determine that suitable replacements cannot more economically and efficiently be made available in the new space. In the absence of such determination, suitable furniture and furnishings for the new space shall be provided, as the Administrator shall determine to be more economical and efficient, (1) from stocks under the control of the moving agency or (2) from stocks available to the Administrator, but the same or similar items shall not be provided from both sources. When furniture and furnishings are provided for the new space from stocks available to the Administrator, the items so provided shall remain in the control of the Administrator, and the furniture and furnishings previously used by the moving agency or unit and not moved to the new space shall pass to the control of the Administrator without reimbursement. When furniture and furnishings not so moved are carried as assets of a revolving or working capital fund at the time they pass to the control of the Administrator, the net book value thereof shall be written off and the capital of the fund diminished by the amount of such write-off. When furniture or furnishings which have been purchased from trust funds pass to the control of the Administrator pursuant to this subsection, reimbursement shall be made by the Administrator for the fair market value of such furniture and furnishings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Lease agreements for periods not exceeding twenty years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator is authorized to enter into lease agreements with any person, copartnership, corporation, or other public or private entity, which do not bind the Government for periods in excess of twenty years for each such lease agreement, on such terms as he deems to be in the interest of the United States and necessary for the accommodation of Federal agencies in buildings and improvements which are in existence or to be erected by the lessor for such purposes and to assign and reassign space therein to Federal agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the unexpired portion of any lease of space to the Government is determined by the Administrator to be surplus property and the property is thereafter disposed of by sublease by the Administrator, the Administrator is authorized, notwithstanding section 485(a) of this title, to deposit rental received in the buildings management fund (subsection (f) of this section) and defray from the fund any costs necessary to provide services to the Government's lessee and to pay the rent not otherwise provided for on the lease of the space to the Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Installation, repair, and replacement of sidewalks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any executive agency is authorized to install, repair, and replace sidewalks around buildings, installations, properties, or grounds under the control of such agency and owned by the United States within the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the possessions of the United States, by reimbursement to a State or political subdivision thereof, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and a possession of the United States, or otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Installation, repair, and replacement under this subsection shall be performed in accordance with regulations to be prescribed by the Administrator of General Services with the approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator is authorized and directed to charge anyone furnished services, space, quarters, maintenance, repair, or other facilities (hereinafter referred to as space and services), at rates to be determined by the Administrator from time to time and provided for in regulations issued by him. Such rates and charges shall approximate commercial charges for comparable space and services, except that with respect to those buildings for which the Administrator of General Services is responsible for alterations only (as the term &ldquo;alter&rdquo; is defined in section 612(5) of this title), the rates charged the occupant for such services shall be fixed by the Administrator so as to recover only the approximate applicable cost incurred by him in providing such alterations. The Administrator may exempt anyone from the charges required by this subsection if he determines that such charges would be infeasible or impractical. To the extent <!-- PDFPage:220 -->any such exemption is granted, appropriations to the General Services Administration are authorized to reimburse the fund for any loss of revenue.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Charges for space and services furnished by executive agencies; approval of rates by Administrator; credit to appropriation or fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any executive agency, other than the General Services Administration, which provides to anyone space and services set forth in subsection (j) of this section, is authorized to charge the occupant for such space and services at rates approved by the Administrator. Moneys derived by such executive agency from such rates or fees shall be credited to the appropriation or fund initially charged for providing the service, except that amounts which are in excess of actual operating and maintenance costs of providing the service shall be credited to miscellaneous receipts unless otherwise authorized by law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Flexiplace work telecommuting centers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator may establish, acquire space for, and equip flexiplace work telecommuting centers (in this subsection referred to as &ldquo;telecommuting centers&rdquo;) for use by employees of Federal agencies, State and local governments, and the private sector in accordance with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator may make any telecommuting center available for use by individuals who are not Federal employees to the extent the center is not being fully utilized by Federal employees. The Administrator shall give Federal employees priority in using the telecommuting centers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Administrator shall charge user fees for the use of any telecommuting center. The amount of the user fee shall approximate commercial charges for comparable space and services except that in no instance shall such fee be less than that necessary to pay the cost of establishing and operating the center, including the reasonable cost of renovation and replacement of furniture, fixtures, and equipment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Amounts received by the Administrator after September 30, 1993, as user fees for use of any telecommuting center may be deposited into the Fund established under subsection (f) of this section and may be used by the Administrator to pay costs incurred in the establishment and operation of the center.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Administrator may provide guidance, assistance, and oversight to any person regarding establishment and operation of alternative workplace arrangements, such as telecommuting, hoteling, virtual offices, and other distributive work arrangements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In considering whether to acquire any space, quarters, buildings, or other facilities for use by employees of any executive agency, the head of that agency shall consider whether the need for the facilities can be met using alternative workplace arrangements referred to in paragraph (4).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 18 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. The plan transfers to the Administrator of General Services the functions of the various Federal agencies with respect to leasing and assigning general-purpose space in buildings and the operation, maintenance, and custody of office buildings. Since such authority is already largely concentrated in the General Services Administration with respect to the District of Columbia, the plan principally relates to the administration of these functions in the field.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:223 --><p class="note-body">The transfers made by this plan will promote more economical leasing, better utilization of building space, and more efficient operation of Government-controlled office buildings. They will effectuate the recommendations of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government with respect to concentrating in the General Services Administration the responsibility for space allotment and the operation of Government buildings outside of the District of Columbia. Likewise, they will extend the principles laid down by the Congress in enacting the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to another important area of Government-wide administrative services&mdash;the administration of Government office buildings and general-purpose building space in the field.</p>
<p class="note-body">Within the District of Columbia, one agency, the Public Buildings Service of the General Services Administration, has long had the operation and custody of most Government buildings and the leasing and assignment of space for executive agencies. Thus, nearly all requests for building space are handled by a single organization which is responsible for seeing that agencies are properly and efficiently housed. This arrangement has proved its worth and has repeatedly been approved by the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">Outside of the National Capital, however, responsibility for the acquisition and control of building space and the operation of Government buildings is widely diffused. A variety of agencies operate and control general-purpose buildings. If quarters are not available in Federal buildings, each agency ordinarily does its own leasing. As a result, in some cases Federal agencies have contracted for space at high rentals at the very time that other agencies have been giving up surplus low-cost space.</p>
<p class="note-body">The assignment of space in Government-owned buildings outside of Washington is also divided among a number of agencies. While the Public Buildings Service constructs a large part of the Government buildings, it operates and controls the assignment of space in only a small proportion of them. The Post Office Department operates and allocates the space in post-office buildings, several hundred of which contain substantial amounts of office space available for other agencies. During and immediately after the war several other Federal agencies acquired office buildings in the field. As their activities have contracted, surplus space in many of these structures has become available for other uses.</p>
<p class="note-body">This plan concentrates in the General Services Administration the responsibility for the leasing and assignment of what is termed general-purpose building space; that is, space which is suitable for the uses of a number of Federal agencies. It specifically excludes space in buildings at military posts, arsenals, navy yards, and similar defense installations and space in hospitals, laboratories, factories, and other special-purpose buildings.</p>
<p class="note-body">Also, the plan excludes the Post Office Department from the transfer of leasing authority since the Department has a highly developed organization for this purpose, and it limits the transfer of space assignment authority in post-office buildings to the space not occupied by the Department. Further, it gives the needs of the Post Office Department priority in the assignment of space in post-office buildings. Thus, the plan amply safeguards the interests of the Post Office Department while making it possible to include the general office space in post-office buildings in any given city with other similar space under Federal control in planning and executing an efficient program for housing Government agencies in that area.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition, the plan transfers to the General Services Administration the operation, maintenance, and custody of office buildings owned or leased by the Government, including those post-office buildings which are not used predominantly for post-office purposes. This will make it possible to establish a single organization for the operation and maintenance of Government office buildings in principal cities in the field as has proved desirable in the National Capital. Since many post offices are in fact primarily large office buildings, the plan includes in this transfer the post-office buildings which are not used predominantly for post-office purposes. This will relieve the Post Office Department of a considerable expenditure for building operation and maintenance which properly should not be charged against postal revenues.</p>
<p class="note-body">While the plan effects a broad transfer of functions with respect to leasing and assignment of space and the operation and maintenance of office buildings, it specifically authorizes the Administrator of General Services to delegate the performance of any part of these functions to other agencies subject to such regulations as he deems desirable for economical and effective administration. In this the plan follows the pattern adopted by the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 for other branches of property management. In large urban centers where numerous Federal units are located unified administration of space activities by the General Services Administration will normally be advantageous. On the other hand, in the smaller communities it will no doubt be desirable to delegate the work back to the agencies directly affected, to be carried on under standards laid down by the Administrator of General Services. The plan provides ample flexibility for working out the most effective administrative arrangement for each type of situation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The fundamental soundness and economy of centralized administration of building space have been amply demonstrated in the National Capital. By virtue of unified control it has been possible since the war to accomplish far-reaching changes which have consolidated agencies in much fewer locations, released many of the rented buildings, and greatly reduced the cost of housing the Government establishment. Similar procedures applied in the larger centers of field activity should produce substantial savings.</p>
<p class="note-body">After investigation, I have found, and hereby declare, that each reorganization contained in this plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body">While it is not possible at this time to calculate the reduction in expenditures which will result from this plan, it can safely be predicted that it will produce substantial savings. I am confident that this reorganization plan will constitute a significant improvement in Federal business practice and will bring about an important increase in efficiency in housing Government agencies.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Facilitating Access to Federal Property for Siting of Mobile Services Antennas</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Aug. 10, 1995, 60 F.R. 42023, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">Recent advancements in mobile telecommunications technology present an opportunity for the rapid construction of the Nation's wireless communications infrastructure. As a matter of policy, the Federal Government shall encourage the efficient and timely implementation of such new technologies and the concomitant infrastructure buildout as a means of stimulating economic growth and creating new jobs. The recent auctioning and impending licensing of radio frequencies for mobile personal communications services presents the Federal Government with the opportunity to foster new technologies and to encourage the development of communications infrastructure by making Federal property available for the siting of mobile services antennas.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, I hereby direct the Administrator of General Services, within 90 <!-- PDFPage:225 -->days, in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Interior, Defense, and the heads of such other agencies as the Administrator may determine, to develop procedures necessary to facilitate appropriate access to Federal property for the siting of mobile services antennas.</p>
<p class="note-body">The procedures should be developed in accordance with the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. (a) Upon request, and to the extent permitted by law and where practicable, executive departments and agencies shall make available Federal Government buildings and lands for the siting of mobile service antennas. This should be done in accordance with Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, and consistent with national security concerns (including minimizing mutual electromagnetic interactions), public health and safety concerns, environmental and aesthetic concerns, preservation of historic buildings and monuments, protection of natural and cultural resources, protection of national park and wilderness values, protection of National Wildlife Refuge systems, and subject to any Federal requirements promulgated by the agency managing the facility and the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and other relevant departments and agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Antennas on Federal buildings or land may not contain any advertising.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Federal property does not include lands held by the United States in trust for individual or Native American tribal governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Agencies shall retain discretion to reject inappropriate siting requests, and assure adequate protection of public property and timely removal of equipment and structures at the end of service.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. All procedures and mechanisms adopted regarding access to Federal property shall be clear and simple so as to facilitate the efficient and rapid buildout of the national wireless communications infrastructure.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. Unless otherwise prohibited by or inconsistent with Federal law, agencies shall charge fees based on market value for siting antennas on Federal property, and may use competitive procedures if not all applicants can be accommodated.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum does not give the siting of mobile services antennas priority over other authorized uses of Federal buildings or land.</p>
<p class="note-body">All independent regulatory commissions and agencies are requested to comply with the provisions of this memorandum.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum is not intended to create any right, benefit or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
