<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) knowledgeable persons qualified in the field of preservation and maintenance have been consulted to determine structural soundness and durability of the commemorative work, and to assure that the commemorative work meets high professional standards;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the person authorized to construct the commemorative work has available sufficient funds to complete construction of the project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Donation for perpetual maintenance and preservation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the foregoing criteria, no construction permit shall be issued unless the person authorized to construct the commemorative work has donated an amount equal to 10 per centum of the total estimated cost of construction to offset the costs of perpetual maintenance and preservation of the commemorative work: <em>Provided</em>, That the provisions of this subsection shall not apply in instances when the commemorative work is constructed by a Department or agency of the Federal Government and less than 50 per centum of the funding for such work is provided by private sources.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Congress authorizes and directs that the Secretary of the Treasury shall make all or a portion of such moneys available to the Secretary or the Administrator at his request for maintenance of commemorative works. Under no circumstances may the Secretary or Administrator request funds from the separate account exceeding the total moneys deposited by persons establishing commemorative works in areas he administers. The Secretary and the Administrator shall maintain an inventory of funds available for such purposes: <em>Provided</em>, That such moneys shall not be subject to annual appropriations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Suspension for misrepresentation in fundraising; annual report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary or the Administrator (as appropriate) may suspend any activity under the authority of this chapter with respect to the establishment of a commemorative work if the Secretary or Administrator determines the fundraising efforts with respect to the commemorative work have misrepresented an affiliation with the commemorative work or the United States.</p>
