<p class="statutory-body">The requirement that certain laborers and mechanics be paid in accordance with the wage-setting provisions of the Act of March 3, 1931 (commonly known as the &ldquo;Davis-Bacon Act&rdquo;) (40 U.S.C. 276a et seq.) as set forth in any of the Acts or provisions described in section 276d&ndash;3 of this title shall not apply to an individual&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) who volunteers&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to perform a service directly to a State or local government or a public agency for civic, charitable, or humanitarian reasons, without promise, expectation, or receipt of compensation for services rendered, other than expenses, reasonable benefits, or a nominal fee (as defined in subsection (b) of this section), but solely for the personal purpose or pleasure of the individual; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to provide such services freely and without pressure or coercion, direct or implied, from any employer;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) whose contribution of service is not for the direct or indirect benefit of any contractor otherwise performing or seeking to perform work on the same project for which the individual is volunteering;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) who is not employed by and does not provide services to a contractor or subcontractor at any time on the federally assisted or insured project for which the individual is volunteering; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) who is not otherwise employed by the same public agency to perform the same type of services as those for which the individual proposes to volunteer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payments of expenses, reasonable benefits, or a nominal fee may be provided to volunteers described in subsection (a) of this section only in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor. In prescribing the regulations, the Secretary shall take into consideration criteria such as the total amount of payments made (relating to expenses, benefits, or fees) in <!-- PDFPage:130 -->the context of the economic realities. The regulations shall include provisions that provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a payment for an expense may be received by a volunteer for items such as uniform allowances, protective gear and clothing, reimbursement for approximate out-of-pocket expenses, or for the cost or expense of meals and transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a reasonable benefit may include the inclusion of a volunteer in a group insurance plan (such as a liability, health, life, disability, or worker's compensation plan) or pension plan, or the awarding of a length of service award; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a nominal fee may not be used as a substitute for compensation and may not be connected to productivity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The decision as to what constitutes a nominal fee for purposes of paragraph (3) shall be determined based on the context of the economic realities of the situation involved and shall be made by the Secretary of Labor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Economic reality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (b) of this section, in determining whether an expense, benefit, or fee described in such subsection may be paid to volunteers in the context of the economic realities of the particular situation, the Secretary of Labor may not permit any such expense, benefit, or fee that has the effect of undermining labor standards by creating downward pressure on prevailing wages in the local construction industry.</p>
