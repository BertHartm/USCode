<p class="statutory-body">(a) For the purposes of conserving oil and natural gas and better utilizing coal, any agency is authorized to sell to any non-Federal person, and to enter into contracts for the sale to any non-Federal person of, electric energy generated by coal-fired electric generating facilities of <!-- PDFPage:263 -->such agency in Alaska without regard to any provision of law which precludes such sale where such energy is available from other local sources, if the agency determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such energy is generated by an existing coal-fired generating facility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such energy is surplus to such agency's needs and is in excess of the electric energy specifically generated for consumption by, or necessary to serve the requirements of, any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the costs to the ultimate consumers of such energy is less than the costs which, in the absence of such sale, would be incurred by such consumers for the purchase of an equivalent amount of energy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) such sale will result in a reduction in the total consumption of oil or natural gas by the non-Federal person purchasing such electric energy below that consumption which would occur in the absence of such sale.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Federally generated electric energy sold by an agency as provided in subsection (a) of this section shall be priced to recover the fuel costs and variable operation and maintenance costs of the Federal generating facility concerned which costs are attributable to such sale, plus an amount equal to one-half the difference between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the costs of producing the electric energy by coal generation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the costs of producing electric energy by the oil or gas generation being displaced.</p>
