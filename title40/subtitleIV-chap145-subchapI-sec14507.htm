<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Federal grant programs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;federal grant programs&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1921 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 460<em>l</em>&ndash;4 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act (16 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (20 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) (known as the Clean Water Act);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) title VI of the Public Health Services Act (42 U.S.C. 291 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) sections 201 and 209 of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3141, 3149);</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To enable the people, States, and local communities of the Appalachian region, including local development districts, to take maximum advantage of federal grant programs for which they are eligible but for which, because of their economic situation, they cannot supply the required matching share, or for which there are insufficient amounts available under the federal law authorizing the programs to meet pressing needs of the region, the Federal Cochairman may use amounts made available to carry out this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for any part of the basic federal contribution to projects or activities under the federal grant programs authorized by federal laws; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to increase the federal contribution to projects and activities under the programs above the fixed maximum part of the cost of the projects or activities otherwise authorized by the applicable law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Certification Required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For a program, project, or activity for which any part of the basic federal contribution to the project or activity under a federal grant program is proposed to be made under subsection (b), the contribution shall not be made until the responsible federal official administering the federal law authorizing the contribution certifies that the program, project, or activity meets the applicable requirements of the federal law and could be approved for federal contribution under that law if amounts were available under the law for the program, project, or activity.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:205 --><p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Limitations in Other Laws Inapplicable</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amounts provided pursuant to this subtitle are available without regard to any limitations on areas eligible for assistance or authorizations for appropriation in any other law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Acceptance of Certain Material</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For a supplemental grant for a project or activity under a federal grant program, the Federal Cochairman shall accept any finding, report, certification, or documentation required to be submitted to the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government responsible for the administration of the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Federal Share</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The federal portion of the cost of a project or activity shall not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) be increased to more than the percentages the Commission establishes; nor</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) be more than 80 percent of the cost.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Commission Contribution.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), the Commission may contribute not more than 50 percent of a project or activity cost eligible for financial assistance under this section from amounts appropriated to carry out this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Distressed counties</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The maximum Commission contribution for a project or activity to be carried out in a county for which a distressed county designation is in effect under section 14526 of this title may be increased to 80 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>At-risk counties</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The maximum Commission contribution for a project to be carried out in a county for which an at-risk county designation is in effect under section 14526 may be increased to 70 percent.</p>
