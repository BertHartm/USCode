<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator may authorize the heads of any of the executive agencies, in accordance with subsection (d)(2) of this section, to carry out a pilot program to test the feasibility of using solutions-based contracting for acquisition of information technology.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Solutions-based contracting described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, solutions-based contracting is an acquisition method under which the acquisition objectives are defined by the Federal Government user of the technology to be acquired, a streamlined contractor selection process is used, and industry sources are allowed to provide solutions that attain the objectives effectively.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Process requirements</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Acquisition plan emphasizing desired result</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Preparation of an acquisition plan that defines the functional requirements of the intended users of the information technology to be acquired, identifies the operational improvements to be achieved, and defines the performance measurements to be applied in determining whether the information technology acquired satisfies the defined requirements and attains the identified results.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:314 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Results-oriented statement of work</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Use of a statement of work that is limited to an expression of the end results or performance capabilities desired under the acquisition plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the costs likely to be associated with the conceptual approach proposed by the offeror.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Open communications with contractor community</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Open availability of the following information to potential offerors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The agency mission to be served by the acquisition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The functional process to be performed by use of information technology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The process improvements to be attained.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Simple solicitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Use of a simple solicitation that sets forth only the functional work description, the source selection factors to be used in accordance with paragraph (4), the required terms and conditions, instructions regarding submission of offers, and the estimate of the Federal Government's budget for the desired work.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Simple proposals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Submission of oral presentations and written proposals that are limited in size and scope and contain information on&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the proposed conceptual approach; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the costs likely to be associated with the proposed conceptual approach.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Simple evaluation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Use of a simplified evaluation process, to be completed within 45 days after receipt of proposals, which consists of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Identification of the most qualified offerors that are within the competitive range.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Issuance of invitations for at least three and not more than five of the identified offerors to make oral presentations to, and engage in discussions with, the evaluating personnel regarding, for each offeror&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Selection of most qualified offeror</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A selection process consisting of the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Conduct for 30 to 60 days of a program definition phase (funded, in the case of the source ultimately awarded the contract, by the Federal Government)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) during which the selected source, in consultation with one or more intended users, develops a conceptual system design and technical approach, defines logical phases for the project, and estimates the total cost and the cost for each phase; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) after which a contract for performance of the work may be awarded to that source on the basis of cost, the responsiveness, reasonableness, and quality of the proposed performance, and a sharing of risk and benefits between the source and the Government.</p>
