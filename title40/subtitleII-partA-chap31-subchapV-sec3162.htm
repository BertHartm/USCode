<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) whose contribution of service is not for the direct or indirect benefit of any contractor otherwise performing or seeking to perform work on the same project for which the individual is volunteering;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) who is not employed by and does not provide services to a contractor or subcontractor at any time on the federally assisted or insured project for which the individual is volunteering; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Criteria and content of regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In prescribing the regulations, the Secretary shall consider criteria such as the total amount of payments made (relating to expenses, benefits, or fees) in the context of the economic realities. The regulations shall include provisions that provide that&mdash;</p>
