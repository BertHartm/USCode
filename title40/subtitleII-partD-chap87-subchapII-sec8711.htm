Nov. 3, <!-- PDFPage:153 -->1967, 81 Stat. 951)] because of section 421 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act (Public Law 93&ndash;198, 87 Stat. 789). The words &ldquo;Council of the District of Columbia&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia&rdquo; [subsequently changed to &ldquo;District of Columbia Council&rdquo; because of section 402(21), (28), (32), and (199) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (eff. Nov. 3, 1967, 81 Stat. 952, 953, 963)] because of sections 401 and 404(a) of the Act (87 Stat. 785, 787).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1)(A), the words &ldquo;the Chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Chairman of the Committee on Government Reform of the House of Representatives&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;and the chairman of the Committees of the District of Columbia of the Senate and the House of Representatives&rdquo; in section 2(b)(1) of the Act of June 24, 1924 (ch. 270), because of Rule XXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, as amended by Senate Resolution 4 (popularly cited as the &ldquo;Committee System Reorganization Amendments of 1977&rdquo;), approved February 4, 1977, section 1(b)(1) of the Act of June 3, 1995 (Public Law 104&ndash;14, 2:21 note prec.), and Rule X(1)(h) of House Resolution No. 5 (105th Congress, January 6, 1999).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;bona fide&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(3), the words &ldquo;except that of the members first appointed, the President shall designate one to serve two years and one to serve four years&rdquo; and &ldquo;The members first appointed under this section shall assume their office on January 2, 1975&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(4), the words &ldquo;are entitled to $100 a day when performing duties&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall each receive compensation at the rate of $100 for each day such member is engaged in the actual performance of duties&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words &ldquo;chapters 33 and 51, and subchapter III of chapter 53&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the civil service and classification laws&rdquo; because of section 7(b) of the Act of September 6, 1966 (Public Law 89&ndash;554, 80 Stat. 631), the first section of which enacted Title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;As hereinafter more specifically described in sections 71c to 71g of this title&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The text of 40:71a(e)(3) is omitted as obsolete because the National Capital Regional Planning Council was abolished by section 1 of Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1966 (eff. Sept. 8, 1966, 40:71b note). In clause (2), the words &ldquo;in such capacity&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (f) is substituted for 40:71h to eliminate obsolete language.</p>

The words &ldquo;Office of Management and Budget&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Bureau of the Budget&rdquo; in section 13 of the Act of June 6, 1924, because the Bureau of the Budget was redesignated the Office of Management and Budget by section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, 84 Stat. 2085). Section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 was repealed by section 5(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982 (Public Law 97&ndash;258, 96 Stat. 1085), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States Code, but the successor provision, 31:501, continued the designation as Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (h), the words &ldquo;beginning in fiscal year 1998 and thereafter&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete.</p>
