<p class="statutory-body">(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of title 23, and other Acts pertaining to Federal-Aid Highways, the Secretary of Transportation shall immediately approve the completion of the parking facility, and associated ramps (including any necessary pedestrian access and walkways, escalators, elevators, moving sidewalk access, and connections) at Union Station, to be financed with interstate highway funds apportioned to the District of Columbia. To the extent necessary to complete such project, such apportionment shall not be subject to any obligation limitation enacted for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1982, or the fiscal year ending September 30, 1983. The amount of such apportionment necessary to complete such project, not to exceed $40,000,000, shall remain available to the District of Columbia until expended, without regard to the provisions of section 118(b) of title 23. The Federal share shall be 100 per centum of the total cost of such project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Within sixty days of December 29, 1981, the Secretary of Transportation shall enter into an agreement with the District of Columbia's Department of Transportation for the Secretary of Transportation's administration of the project described in subsection (a) of this section. Such project agreement shall provide that all right, title, and interest in such parking facility shall remain in the United States. The rate of fees charged for use of the parking facility may exceed the rate required for maintenance and operation of the facility, and shall be established in a manner that encourages its use by rail passengers and participants in activities in the Union Station complex and area.</p>
