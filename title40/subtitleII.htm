<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Type of Bonds Required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before any contract of more than $100,000 is awarded for the construction, alteration, or repair of any public building or public work of the Federal Government, a person must furnish to the Government the following bonds, which become binding when the contract is awarded:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Performance bond</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A performance bond with a surety satisfactory to the officer <!-- PDFPage:89 -->awarding the contract, and in an amount the officer considers adequate, for the protection of the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Payment bond</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A payment bond with a surety satisfactory to the officer for the protection of all persons supplying labor and material in carrying out the work provided for in the contract for the use of each person. The amount of the payment bond shall equal the total amount payable by the terms of the contract unless the officer awarding the contract determines, in a writing supported by specific findings, that a payment bond in that amount is impractical, in which case the contracting officer shall set the amount of the payment bond. The amount of the payment bond shall not be less than the amount of the performance bond.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Coverage for Taxes in Performance Bond.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Every performance bond required under this section specifically shall provide coverage for taxes the Government imposes which are collected, deducted, or withheld from wages the contractor pays in carrying out the contract with respect to which the bond is furnished.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Notice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Government shall give the surety on the bond written notice, with respect to any unpaid taxes attributable to any period, within 90 days after the date when the contractor files a return for the period, except that notice must be given no later than 180 days from the date when a return for the period was required to be filed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Civil action</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Government may not bring a civil action on the bond for the taxes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) unless notice is given as provided in this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) more than one year after the day on which notice is given.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Waiver of Bonds for Contracts Performed in Foreign Countries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contracting officer may waive the requirement of a performance bond and payment bond for work under a contract that is to be performed in a foreign country if the officer finds that it is impracticable for the contractor to furnish the bonds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Require Additional Bonds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section does not limit the authority of a contracting officer to require a performance bond or other security in addition to those, or in cases other than the cases, specified in subsection (b).</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13006, May 21, 1996, 61 F.R. 26071, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 <em>et seq</em>.) and the Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976 (90 Stat. 2505) [title I of Pub. L. 94&ndash;541, see Tables for classification], and in furtherance of and consistent with Executive Order No. 12072 of August 16, 1978 [40 U.S.C. 121 note], and Executive Order No. 11593 of May 13, 1971 [16 U.S.C. 470 note], it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Statement of Policy</em>. Through the Administration's community empowerment initiatives, the Federal Government has undertaken various efforts to revitalize our central cities, which have historically served as the centers for growth and commerce in our metropolitan areas. Accordingly, the Administration hereby reaffirms the commitment set forth in Executive Order No. 12072 to strengthen our Nation's cities by encouraging the location of Federal facilities in our central cities. The Administration also reaffirms the commitments set forth in the National Historic Preservation Act to provide leadership in the preservation of historic resources, and in the Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976 to acquire and utilize space in suit<!-- PDFPage:102 -->able buildings of historic, architectural, or cultural significance.</p>
<p class="note-body">To this end, the Federal Government shall utilize and maintain, wherever operationally appropriate and economically prudent, historic properties and districts, especially those located in our central business areas. When implementing these policies, the Federal Government shall institute practices and procedures that are sensible, understandable, and compatible with current authority and that impose the least burden on, and provide the maximum benefit to, society.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Encouraging the Location of Federal Facilities on Historic Properties in Our Central Cities</em>. When operationally appropriate and economically prudent, and subject to the requirements of section 601 of title VI of the Rural Development Act of 1972, as amended (42 U.S.C. 3122) [now 7 U.S.C. 2204b&ndash;1], and Executive Order No. 12072, when locating Federal facilities, Federal agencies shall give first consideration to historic properties within historic districts. If no such property is suitable, then Federal agencies shall consider other developed or undeveloped sites within historic districts. Federal agencies shall then consider historic properties outside of historic districts, if no suitable site within a district exists. Any rehabilitation or construction that is undertaken pursuant to this order must be architecturally compatible with the character of the surrounding historic district or properties.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Identifying and Removing Regulatory Barriers</em>. Federal agencies with responsibilities for leasing, acquiring, locating, maintaining, or managing Federal facilities or with responsibilities for the planning for, or managing of, historic resources shall take steps to reform, streamline, and otherwise minimize regulations, policies, and procedures that impede the Federal Government's ability to establish or maintain a presence in historic districts or to acquire historic properties to satisfy Federal space needs, unless such regulations, policies, and procedures are designed to protect human health and safety or the environment. Federal agencies are encouraged to seek the assistance of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation when taking these steps.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Improving Preservation Partnerships</em>. In carrying out the authorities of the National Historic Preservation Act, the Secretary of the Interior, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and each Federal agency shall seek appropriate partnerships with States, local governments, Indian tribes, and appropriate private organizations with the goal of enhancing participation of these parties in the National Historic Preservation Program. Such partnerships should embody the principles of administrative flexibility, reduced paperwork, and increased service to the public.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order is not intended to create, nor does it create, any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Reports of Inspectors</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An officer or individual designated as an inspector of the work to be performed under a contract described in section 3701 of this title, or to aid in the enforcement or fulfillment of the contract, on observation or after investigation immediately shall report to the proper officer of the Federal Government, a territory of the United States, or the District of Columbia all violations of this chapter occurring in the performance of the work, together with the name of each laborer or mechanic who was required or permitted to work in violation of this chapter and the day the violation occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Withholding Amounts.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Determining amount</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The amount of unpaid wages and liquidated damages owing under this chapter shall be determined administratively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Amount directed to be withheld</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The officer or individual whose duty it is to approve the payment of money by the Government, territory, or District of Columbia in connection with the performance of the contract work shall direct the amount of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) liquidated damages to be withheld for the use and benefit of the Government, territory, or District; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) unpaid wages to be withheld for the use and benefit of the laborers and mechanics who were not compensated as required under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Payment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Comptroller General shall pay the amount administratively determined to be due directly to the laborers and mechanics from amounts withheld on account of underpayments of wages if the amount withheld is adequate. If the amount withheld is not adequate, the Comptroller General shall pay an equitable proportion of the amount due.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Right of Action and Intervention Against Contractors and Sureties</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the accrued payments withheld under the terms of the contract are insufficient to reimburse all the laborers and mechanics who have not been paid the wages required under this chapter, the laborers and mechanics, in the case of a department or agency of the Government, have the same right of action and intervention against the contractor and the contractor's sureties as is conferred by law on persons furnishing labor or materials. In those proceedings it is not a defense that the laborers and mechanics accepted or agreed to accept less than the required rate of wages or voluntarily made refunds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Review Process.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Time limit for appeal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Within 60 days after an amount is withheld as liquidated damages, any contractor or subcontractor aggrieved by the withholding may appeal to the head of the agency of the Government or territory for which the contract work is done or which is providing financial assistance for the work, or to the Mayor of the District of Columbia in the case of liquidated damages withheld for the use and benefit of the District.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Review by agency head or mayor</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The agency head or Mayor may review the administrative determination of liquidated damages. The agency head or Mayor may issue a final order affirming the determination or may recommend to the Secretary of Labor that an appropriate adjustment in liquidated damages be made, or that the contractor or subcontractor be relieved of liability for the liquidated damages, if it is found that the amount is incorrect or that the contractor or subcontractor violated this chapter inadvertently, notwithstanding the exercise of due care by the contractor or subcontractor and the agents of the contractor or subcontractor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Review by secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall review all pertinent facts in the matter and may conduct any investigation the Secretary considers necessary in order to affirm or reject the recommendation. The decision of the Secretary is final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Judicial action</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contractor or subcontractor aggrieved by a final order for the withholding of liquidated damages may file a claim in the United States Court of Federal Claims within 60 days after the final order. A final order of the agency head, Mayor, or Secretary is conclusive with respect to findings of fact if supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Applicability of Other Laws.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Reorganization plan</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Reorganization Plan Numbered 14 of 1950 (eff. May 24, 1950, 64 Stat. 1267) applies to this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Section 3145</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Section 3145 of this title applies to contractors and subcontractors referred to in section 3145 who are engaged in the performance of contracts subject to this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In formulating standards under this section, the Secretary shall consult with the Advisory Committee created by subsection (d).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Compliance.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Actions to gain compliance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may make inspections, hold hearings, issue orders, and make decisions based on findings of fact as the Secretary considers necessary to gain compliance with this section and any health and safety standard the Secretary prescribes under subsection (a).

The judgment of the court may be reviewed by the Supreme Court as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

Nov. 3, 1967, 81 Stat. 951)] because of section 421 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act (Public Law 93&ndash;198, 87 Stat. 789). The words &ldquo;Council of the District of Columbia&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia&rdquo; [subsequently changed to &ldquo;District of Columbia Council&rdquo; because of section 402(21), (28), (32), and (199) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (eff. Nov. 3, 1967, 81 Stat. 952, 953, 963)] because of sections 401 and 404(a) of the Act (87 Stat. 785, 787).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1)(A), the words &ldquo;the Chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Chairman of the Committee on Government Reform of the House of Representatives&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;and the chairman of the Committees of the District of Columbia of the Senate and the House of Representatives&rdquo; in section 2(b)(1) of the Act of June 24, 1924 (ch. 270), because of Rule XXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, as amended by Senate Resolution 4 (popularly cited as the &ldquo;Committee System Reorganization Amendments of 1977&rdquo;), approved February 4, 1977, section 1(b)(1) of the Act of June 3, 1995 (Public Law 104&ndash;14, 2:21 note prec.), and Rule X(1)(h) of House Resolution No. 5 (105th Congress, January 6, 1999).</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words &ldquo;chapters 33 and 51, and subchapter III of chapter 53&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the civil service and classification laws&rdquo; because of section 7(b) of the Act of September 6, 1966 (Public Law 89&ndash;554, 80 Stat. 631), the first section of which enacted Title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;As hereinafter more specifically described in sections 71c to 71g of this title&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The text of 40:71a(e)(3) is omitted as obsolete because the National Capital Regional Planning Council was abolished by section 1 of Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1966 (eff. Sept. 8, 1966, 40:71b note). In clause (2), the words &ldquo;in such capacity&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>

The words &ldquo;Office of Management and Budget&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Bureau of the Budget&rdquo; in section 13 of the Act of June 6, 1924, because the Bureau of the Budget was redesignated the Office of Management and Budget by section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, 84 Stat. 2085). Section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 was repealed by section 5(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982 (Public Law 97&ndash;258, 96 Stat. 1085), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States Code, but the successor provision, 31:501, continued the designation as Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (h), the words &ldquo;beginning in fiscal year 1998 and thereafter&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete.</p>
