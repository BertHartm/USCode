<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2), the words &ldquo;pursuant to law&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;Secretary of the Army&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Department of War&rdquo; [subsequently changed to &ldquo;Department of the Army&rdquo; because of section 205(a) of the National Security Act of 1947 (ch. 343, 61 Stat. 501)] because of 10:3013(a)(1).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the word &ldquo;additional&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;other than his regular pay as an officer of the Corps of Engineers&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;of him&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;this chapter&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;title 21 of the Revised Statutes&rdquo; because the only provisions of title 21 related to the Chief of Engineers that have not been repealed are contained in the revised chapter.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;an office&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;official apartments&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;District of Columbia&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;city of Washington&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words &ldquo;Administrator of General Services&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;President&rdquo; [subsequently changed to &ldquo;Public Buildings Commission&rdquo; because of section 10 of the Act of March 1, 1919 (ch. 86, 40 Stat. 1269), &ldquo;National Park Service&rdquo; because of section 2 of Executive Order No. 6166 (eff. June 10, 1933) and the Act of March 2, 1934 (ch. 38, 48 Stat. 389), and &ldquo;Public Buildings Administrator in the Federal Works Agency&rdquo; because of sections 301 and 303 of Reorganization Plan No. I of 1939 (eff. July 1, 1939, 53 Stat. 1426, 1427)] because of section 103(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 380), which is restated as section 303(c) [303(b)] of the revised title.</p>
