<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General purposes; findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of sections 71 to 71i, 72, 73, and 74 of this title to secure comprehensive planning for the physical development of the National Capital and its environs; to provide for the participation of the appropriate planning agencies of the environs in such planning; and to establish the agency and procedures requisite to the administration of the functions of the Federal and District of Columbia governments related to such planning. The Congress finds that the location of the seat of government in the District of Columbia has brought about the development of a metropolitan region extending well into adjoining territory in Maryland and Virginia; that effective comprehensive planning is necessary on a regional basis and of continuing importance to the Federal establishment; that the distribution of Federal installations throughout the region has been and will continue to be a major influence in determining the extent and character of development; that there is needed a central planning agency for the National Capital region to coordinate certain developmental activities of the many different agencies of the Federal and District Governments so that such activities may conform with general objectives; that there is an increasing mutuality of interest and responsibility between the various levels of government that calls for coordinate and unified policies in planning both Federal and local development in the interest of order and economy; that there are developmental problems of an interstate character, the planning of which requires collaboration between Federal, State, and local governments in the interest of equity and constructive action; and that the instrumentalities and procedures herein provided will aid in providing the Congress from time to time with information and advice requisite to legislation. The general objective of said sections is to enable appropriate agencies to plan for the development of the Federal establishment at the seat of government in a manner consistent with the nature and function of the National Capital and with due regard for the rights and prerogatives of the adjoining States and local governments to exercise control appropriate to their functions, and in a manner which will, in accordance with present and future needs, best promote public health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity, and the general welfare, as well as efficiency and economy in the process of development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in sections 71 to 71i, 72, 73, and 74 of this title, (1) &ldquo;region&rdquo; or &ldquo;National Capital region&rdquo; means the District of Columbia; Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties in Maryland; Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William Counties in Virginia; and all cities now or hereafter existing in Maryland or Virginia within the geographic area bounded by the outer boundaries of the combined area of said counties; (2) &ldquo;environs&rdquo; means the territory sur<!-- PDFPage:19 -->rounding the District of Columbia included within the National Capital region; (3) &ldquo;National Capital&rdquo; means the District of Columbia and territory owned by the United States within the environs; and (4) &ldquo;planning agency&rdquo; means any city, county, bi-county, part-county, or regional planning agency authorized under State and local laws to make and adopt comprehensive plans whether or not its jurisdiction is exclusive or concurrent.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(2) Mayor of District of Columbia; central local agency; functions; excepted functions; comprehensive plan for District: procedures for citizen participation and consultations with non-Federal agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Mayor of the District of Columbia (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Mayor&rdquo;) shall be the central planning agency for the government of the District of Columbia (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;District&rdquo;) in the National Capital. The Mayor shall be responsible for coordinating the planning activities of the District government and for preparing and implementing the District elements of the comprehensive plan for the National Capital, which may include land use elements, urban renewal and redevelopment elements, a multiyear program of public works for the District, and physical, social, economic, transportation, and population elements. The Mayor's planning responsibility shall not extend to Federal or international projects and developments in the District, as determined by the Commission, or to the United States Capitol buildings and grounds as defined in sections 193a and 193m of this title, or to any extension thereof or additions thereto, or to buildings and grounds under the care of the Architect of the Capitol. In carrying out his responsibility under this section, the Mayor shall establish procedures for citizen participation in the planning process, and for appropriate meaningful consultation with any State or local government or planning agency in the National Capital region affected by any aspect of a comprehensive plan (including amendments thereto) affecting or relating to the District.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(3) Comprehensive plan for District; functions of Mayor and Council respecting impact on Federal Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Mayor shall submit each District element of the comprehensive plan and any amendment thereto, to the Council for revision or modification, and adoption, by act, following public hearings. Following adoption and prior to imple<!-- PDFPage:20 -->mentation, the Council shall submit each such element or amendment to the Commission for review and comment with regard to the impact of such element or amendment on the interests or functions of the Federal Establishment in the National Capital.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(A) The Commission shall, within sixty days after receipt of such a District element of the comprehensive plan, or amendment thereto, from the Council, certify to the Council whether such element or amendment has a negative impact on the interests or functions of the Federal Establishment in the National Capital. If within such sixty days the Commission takes no action with respect to such element or amendment, such element or amendment shall be deemed to have no such negative impact, and such element or amendment shall be incorporated into the comprehensive plan for the National Capital and shall be implemented.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">If the Council accepts such findings and recommendations and modifies such element or amendment under clause (ii), the Council shall submit such element or amendment to the Commission for it to determine whether such modification has been made in accordance with the Commission's findings and recommendations. If, within thirty days after receipt of the modified element or amendment, the Commission takes no action with respect to such element or amendment, it shall be deemed to have been modified in accordance with such findings or recommendations, and shall be incorporated into the comprehensive plan for the National Capital and shall be implemented. If within such thirty days, the Commission again determines such element or amendment to have a negative impact on the functions or interests of the Federal Establishment in the National Capital such element or amendment shall not be implemented.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the Council rejects the findings and recommendations of the Commission and resubmits a modified element or amendment to it under clause (i), the Commission shall, within sixty days after receipt of such modified element or amendment from the Council, determine whether such modified element or amendment has a negative impact on the interests or functions of the Federal Establishment within the National Capital. If the Commission finds such negative impact it shall certify its findings (in sufficient detail that the Council can understand the basis of the objection of the Commission) and recommendations to the Council, and such element or amendment shall not be implemented. If the Commission takes no action with respect to such modified element or amendment within such sixty days, such modified element or amendment shall be deemed to have no such negative impact and shall be incorporated into the comprehensive plan and it shall be implemented. Any element or amendment which the Commission has determined to have a negative impact on the Federal Establishment in the National Capital, and which is submitted again in a modified form not less than one year from the day it was last rejected by the Commission shall be deemed to be a new element or amendment for purposes of the review procedure specified in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Commission and the Mayor shall jointly publish, from time to time as appropriate, a comprehensive plan for the National Capital, consisting of the elements of the comprehensive plan for the Federal activities in the National Capital developed by the Commission, and the District elements developed by the Mayor and the Council in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Section 1. Abolition</h4>
<p class="note-body">The National Capital Regional Planning Council (66 Stat. 783), together with all of its functions, is hereby abolished.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Sec. 2. Liquidation</h4>
<p class="note-body">The National Capital Planning Commission shall make such provisions as it shall deem necessary respecting the winding up of the outstanding affairs of the National Capital Regional Planning Council.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I am transmitting Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1966, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p class="note-body">The time has come to recognize the readiness of local governments in the Washington area to undertake a role which is properly and rightfully theirs. To that end, I am submitting a reorganization plan to abolish the National Capital Regional Planning Council.</p>
<p class="note-body">Comprehensive regional planning is vital to the orderly development of our metropolitan areas. Nowhere is it more important than in the National Capital region.</p>
<p class="note-body">To be most effective, regional planning must be a responsibility of the area's State and local governments acting together to solve mutual problems of growth and change. It should not be a Federal function, although the Federal Government should support and advance it.</p>
<p class="note-body">The need for cooperative planning was recognized years ago in the National Capital region. The establishment of the National Capital Regional Planning Council in 1952 to prepare a comprehensive development plan was a major step in meeting that need.</p>
<p class="note-body">However, the Council was designed for conditions which no longer exist. It was established by Federal law as a Federal agency financed by Federal funds because the various local jurisdictions then felt they were not in a position to provide the financing necessary for areawide comprehensive planning.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:23 --><p class="note-body">The situation that existed in 1952 has been changed by two major developments&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">The founding of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">The inauguration of a nationwide urban planning assistance program, commonly referred to as the &ldquo;701 Program.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, established in 1957, is a voluntary association of elected officials of local governments in the area. It has a competent professional staff and has done constructive work on areawide development matters. It had a budget of nearly a quarter of a million dollars for fiscal year 1965, mostly derived from local government contributions, and has developed to the point where it can fully carry out the State and local aspects of regional planning.</p>
<p class="note-body">The urban planning assistance program provides for Federal financing of two-thirds of the cost of metropolitan planning. The National Capital Regional Planning Council, as a Federal agency, is not eligible for assistance under this program. The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, however, became eligible for that assistance under the terms of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965. Accordingly, the elected local governments of the National Capital region have declared their intention of undertaking the responsibility for areawide comprehensive planning through the Council of Governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganization plan will not alter the basic responsibilities of the National Capital Planning Commission. That Commission will continue to represent the Federal interest in the planning and development of the region. Indeed, its work should increase as comprehensive regional planning by the Council of Governments is accelerated. In accord with the reorganization plan, the Commission will work closely with the Council of Governments in regional planning. The Commission will also deal directly with the suburban jurisdictions and assume the liaison functions now exercised by the National Capital Regional Planning Council.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganization plan will improve existing organizational arrangements of and promote more effective and efficient planning for the National Capital region.</p>
<p class="note-body">It will also result in long-range savings to the Federal Government. The regional planning effort of the Council of Governments is supported in part by local contributions. The same work done by the National Capital Regional Planning Council has been supported totally with Federal funds. The plan will eliminate this overlapping effort.</p>
<p class="note-body">Annual savings of at least $25,000 should result from the reorganization plan.</p>
<p class="note-body">The functions to be abolished by the reorganization plan are provided for in sections 2(e), 3, 4, 5(d), and 6(b) of the act approved June 6, 1924, entitled &ldquo;An Act providing for a comprehensive development of the park and playground system of the National Capital&rdquo; (43 Stat. 463), as amended (66 Stat. 783, 40 U.S.C. 71a(e), 71b, 71c, 71d(d), and 71E(b)).</p>
<p class="note-body">I have found, after investigation, that each reorganization included in the accompanying reorganization plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p class="note-body">I recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Prior to the final adoption of the comprehensive plan or any element thereof, or any subsequent revision, the Commission shall present such plan, element, or revision to the appropriate Federal or District of Columbia authorities for comment and recommendations. Presentation of proposed revisions may at the Commission's discretion be made annually in a consolidated form.

The Commission may, in addition and at its discretion, periodically provide opportunity by public hearings, meetings, or conferences, exhibitions and publication of its plans, for review and comments by nongovernmental agencies or groups, and, in consultation with the Council of the District of Columbia, encourage the formation of one or more citizen advisory councils.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out its planning functions with respect to Federal developments or projects in the environs, the Commission may act in conjunction and cooperation and enter into agreements with any State or local authority or planning agency, as the Commission may deem necessary, to effectuate the adoption of any plan or proposal and secure its realization.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Consultations between agencies and Commission; procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to insure the comprehensive planning and orderly development of the National Capital, each Federal and District of Columbia agency prior to the preparation of construction plans originated by such agency for proposed developments and projects or to commitments for the acquisition of land, to be paid for in whole or in part from Federal or District funds, shall advise and consult with the Commission in the preparation by the agency of plans and programs in preliminary and successive stages which affect the plan and development of the National Capital: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the Commission shall determine in advance the type or kinds of plans, developments, projects, improvements, or acquisitions which do not need to be submitted for review by the Commission as to conformity with its plans. After receipt of such plans, maps, and data, it shall be the duty of the Commission to make promptly a preliminary report and recommendations to the agency or agencies concerned. If, after having received and considered the report and recommendations of the Commission the agency does not concur, it shall advise the Commission with its reasons therefor, and the Commission shall submit a final report. After such consultation and suitable consideration of the views of the Commission the agency may proceed to take action in accordance with its legal responsibilities and authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exceptions to consultation procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The procedure prescribed in subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to projects within the Capitol grounds or to structures erected by the Department of Defense during wartime or <!-- PDFPage:25 -->national emergency within existing military, naval, or Air Force reservations, except that the appropriate defense agency shall consult with the Commission as to any developments which materially affect traffic or require coordinated planning of the surrounding area.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Additional procedure for consultation on developments and projects within environs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within the environs, general plans showing the location, character, extent and intensity of use for proposed Federal and District developments and projects involving the acquisition of land, shall be submitted to the Commission for report and recommendations before final commitment to said acquisition, unless such matters shall have been specifically approved by an Act of Congress. Before acting on any general plan, the Commission shall advise and consult with the National Capital Regional Planning Council and the appropriate planning agency having jurisdiction over the affected part of the environs.

<p class="note-body">The Act of Congress approved August 30, 1890, providing a site for the Government Printing Office (United States Statutes at Large, volume 26, chapter 837), referred to in text, is act Aug. 30, 1890, ch. 837, 26 Stat. 412, which enacted section 120 of this title, section 861a of former Title 10, Army and Air Force, section 446 of Title 16, Conservation, sections 497, 601 and 651 of former Title 31, Money and Finance, section 887 of Title 33, Navigation and Navigable Waters, and sections 212, 662 and 945 of Title 43, Public Lands, and amended section 321 of Title 43. Former Titles 10 and 31 were revised generally by act Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, &sect;1, 70A Stat. 1, and Pub. L. 97&ndash;258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 877, respectively. For disposition of sections of former titles, see Table I&mdash;Revised Titles. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Tables.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2 of act August 30, 1890, referred to in text, created a board consisting of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Public Printer, and the Architect of the Capitol to acquire land for the accommodation of the Government Printing Office and the construction of needed storage and distributing warehouses in connection therewith. Section 3 of such act authorized the board to acquire the land by negotiation at a price not above a fair relative value as to other lands which had been sold in the immediate vicinity; or if the board were unable to purchase said land by agreement with any one or more of the respective owners at a reasonable price within sixty days after the passage of the act, it was authorized to &ldquo;make application to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia [now the United States District Court for the District of Columbia], at any general or special term thereof, by petition for the condemnation of such land not so purchased, and for the ascertainment of its value. Such petition shall contain a particular description of the property not so purchased, and selected for the purpose aforesaid, with the name of the owner or owners thereof and their residences, so far as the same may be ascertained, together with a plan of the land proposed to be taken; and thereupon the said court is authorized and required to cite all such owners and all other persons interested to appear in said court at a time to be fixed by such court, on reasonable notice, to answer the said petition; and if it shall appear to the court that there are any owners or other persons interested who are under disability the court shall give public notice of the time at which the said court will proceed with the matter of condemnation; and at such time if it shall appear that there are any persons under disability either who have appeared or who have not appeared, the court shall appoint guardians ad litem for each such persons, and the court shall thereupon proceed to appoint three capable and disinterested commissioners to appraise the value of the respective interests of all persons concerned in such lands, under such regulations as to notice and hearing as to the court shall seem meet. Such commissioners shall thereupon, after being duly sworn for the proper performance of their duties, examine the premises and hear the persons in interest who may appear before them, and return their appraisement of the value of the interests of all persons, respectively, in such land; and in case any of the persons entitled according to the judgment of the court are under disability, or can not be found, or neglect to receive payment, the money to be paid to any of them shall be deposited in the Treasury to their credit, unless there shall be some person lawfully authorized to receive the same under the direction of the court, and when such payments are so made, or the amounts belonging to persons to whom payment shall not be made are so deposited, the said lands shall be deemed to be condemned and taken by the United States for the public use.&rdquo; These provisions were never executed and the appropriation therefor was suspended by act Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 542, 26 Stat. 989.</p>
<p class="note-body">However, the provisions of section 3 of the act of Aug. 30, 1890, referred to and partly quoted above, with respect to condemnation proceeding, were rendered general and permanent by a provision of the end of that section which read as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;And hereafter, in all cases of the taking of property in the District of Columbia for public use, whether herein, heretofore, or hereafter authorized, the foregoing provisions, as it respects the application by the proper officer to the supreme court of the District of Columbia [see above for change in name] and the proceedings therein shall be as in the foregoing provisions declared&rdquo;. In view of this provision, section 3, reworded at the beginning thereof to incorporate it, was classified to former section 120 of this title. Former section 120 was superseded in effect by act Mar. 1, 1929, ch. 416, 45 Stat. 1415, which was formerly classified to section 361 et seq. of this title. See chapter 13 (&sect;16&ndash;1301 et seq.) of Title 16, Particular Actions, Proceedings and Matters, of the District of Columbia Code.</p>
