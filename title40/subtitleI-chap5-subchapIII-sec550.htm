<p class="note-body">In subsection (e)(4), the words &ldquo;this subsection&rdquo; are used to reflect the probable intent of Congress. In 40:484(k)(2)(C), the words &ldquo;this subsection&rdquo; should probably be &ldquo;this paragraph&rdquo;, meaning 40:484(k)(2).

In 40:484(k)(3)(A), the words &ldquo;this subsection&rdquo; should probably be &ldquo;this paragraph&rdquo;, meaning 40:484(k)(3). In the revised section, the reference to 40:484(k)(3) is translated as &ldquo;this subsection&rdquo; to reflect the restatement of 40:484(k)(3) as subsection (h) of the revised section.
