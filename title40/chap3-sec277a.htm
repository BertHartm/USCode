<p class="note-body">Section, acts June 27, 1942, ch. 450, title I, 56 Stat. 407; June 26, 1943, ch. 145, title I, 57 Stat. 178; June 27, 1944, ch. 286, title I, 58 Stat. 368; May 3, 1945, ch. 106, title I, 59 Stat. 114; Mar. 28, 1946, ch. 113, title I, 60 Stat. 67; July 30, 1947, ch. 359, title I, 61 Stat. 594; Apr. 20, 1948, ch. 219, title I, 62 Stat. 183; June 30, 1949, ch. 288, title I, &sect;103, 63 Stat. 380; Aug. 24, 1949, ch. 506, title I, 63 Stat. 640, related to compensation of per diem employees, at rates approved by the Administrator of General Services, out of appropriations for salaries and expenses, public buildings and grounds in and outside the District of Columbia, and for national industrial reserve; and to emergency employment such persons subject to the Administrator's confirmation. While similar provisions, with respect to such compensation, were contained in the Independent Offices Appropriation Act, 1951, act Sept. 6, 1950, ch. 896, Ch. VIII, title I, 64 Stat. 697, they are broader in scope, and the language of this section was not repeated therein in toto. It would seem that the provisions expire from year to year with the particular appropriation acts of which they are a part.</p>
