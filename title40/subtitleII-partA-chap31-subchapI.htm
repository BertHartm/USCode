<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;subtreasuries&rdquo; in the 6th complete paragraph on p. 614 of section 1 of the Act of July 1, 1898 (ch. 546, 30 Stat. 614), is omitted because section 1 (words in par. under heading &ldquo;Independent Treasury&rdquo;) of the Act of May 29, 1914 (ch. 214, 41 Stat. 654) discontinued subtreasuries. The word &ldquo;post-offices&rdquo; in section 1 is omitted because section 1 of Executive Order No. 6166 (eff. June 10, 1933) transferred administration of post office buildings to the Post Office Department. The words &ldquo;courthouses, customhouses, appraiser's stores, barge offices, and other&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;or are in course of construction&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete. The words &ldquo;Administrator of General Services&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Treasury Department&rdquo; and &ldquo;Secretary of the Treasury&rdquo; [subsequently changed to &ldquo;Federal Works Agency&rdquo; and &ldquo;Federal Works Administrator&rdquo; because of sections 301 and 303, respectively, of Reorganization Plan No. I of 1939 (eff. July 1, 1939, 53 Stat. 1426, 1427)] because of section 103(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 380), which is restated as section 303(c) [303(b)] of the revised title.</p>
