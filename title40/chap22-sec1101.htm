<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) development of such a Federal building complex will permit consolidation of a number of Federal agencies which are currently housed in numerous, scattered locations and will enable more economical and efficient use of building space and environs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) inclusion of an international cultural and trade center within the Federal building complex will create and enhance opportunities for American trade, commerce, communications, and cultural exchanges with other nations and complement the work of Federal, State, and local agencies in the areas of international trade and cultural exchange; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the appropriate development, maintenance, and use of the Federal Triangle property should be a joint development effort of the General Services Administration, the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, and the International Cultural and Trade Center Commission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To transfer the Federal Triangle property from the Administrator of General Services to the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To grant to the Corporation the power of eminent domain to acquire certain properties and rights-of-way adjacent to the Federal Triangle site and to authorize the Corporation to exercise such power as may be necessary to further the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To authorize the Corporation, after consultation with the Secretary of State, the Administrator, and the Commission, to prepare plans for development of such property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To establish a process for review and selection of such plans and, after completion of such review process, to authorize the Corporation to enter into an agreement with a private developer selected for the development of such property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To ensure that the design and construction of the Federal building complex on such property will insofar as practicable be in accordance with the guiding principles for Federal architecture recommended by the Committee on Federal Office Space in 1962 which require among other things that facilities to be used by Federal agencies be efficient and economical and that public buildings provide visual testimony to the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) To provide for establishment, operation, and maintenance of a self-sustaining international cultural and trade center in such complex.</p>
