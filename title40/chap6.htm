<p class="statutory-body">(1) Section 252(c)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#356_1_target" name="356_1">1</a></sup> of title 41 and section 255 of this title shall apply to purchase contract agree<!-- PDFPage:160 -->ments entered into under this section, except that any such agreement may be entered into and placed in effect after request for but prior to receipt of an opinion of the Attorney General with respect to the validity of title to the property described therein.</p>
