<p class="note-body">This section is added to provide an accurate literal translation of the words &ldquo;this Act&rdquo;, meaning the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. In the positive law codification of title 40, most of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 is restated as subtitle I of title 40. However, title III of the Act, which is outside the scope of the positive law codification, remains classified to the United States Code as 41 U.S.C. 251 et seq. Where the words &ldquo;this Act&rdquo; are restated, substituting the words &ldquo;this subtitle&rdquo; does not yield an accurate literal translation because &ldquo;this subtitle&rdquo; does not include title III of the Act. This section does not subject any provision of law to title III of the Act if that provision was not subject to title III prior to the positive law codification of title 40.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12512, Apr. 29, 1985, 50 F.R. 18453, which related to Federal real property management, was revoked by Ex. Ord. No. 13327, &sect;8, Feb. 4, 2004, 69 F.R. 5897, set out below.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 12954. Ensuring the Economical and Efficient Administration and Completion of Federal Government Contracts</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12954, Mar. 8, 1995, 60 F.R. 13023, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Efficient economic performance and productivity are directly related to the existence of cooperative working relationships between employers and employees. When Federal contractors become involved in prolonged labor disputes with their employees, the Federal Government's economy, efficiency, and cost of operations are adversely affected. In order to operate as effectively as possible, by receiving timely goods and quality services, the Federal Government must assist the entities with which it has contractual relations to develop stable relationships with their employees.</p>
<p class="note-body">An important aspect of a stable collective bargaining relationship is the balance between allowing businesses to operate during a strike and preserving worker rights. This balance is disrupted when permanent replacement employees are hired. It has been found that strikes involving permanent replacement workers are longer in duration than other strikes. In addition, the use of permanent replacements can change a limited dispute into a broader, more contentious struggle, thereby exacerbating the problems that initially led to the strike. By permanently replacing its workers, an employer loses the accumulated knowledge, experience, skill, and expertise of its incumbent employees. These circumstances then adversely affect the businesses and entities, such as the Federal Government, which rely on that employer to provide high quality and reliable goods or services.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, and by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including 40 U.S.C. 486(a) [now 40 U.S.C. 121(a)] and 3 U.S.C. 301, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, contracting agencies shall not contract with employers that permanently replace lawfully striking employees. All discretion under this Executive order shall be exercised consistent with this policy.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. (a) The Secretary of Labor (&ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) may investigate an organizational unit of a Federal contractor to determine whether the unit has permanently replaced lawfully striking workers. Such investigation shall be conducted in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary shall receive and may investigate complaints by employees of any entity covered under section 2(a) of this order where such complaints allege lawfully striking employees have been permanently replaced.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Secretary may hold such hearings, public or private, as he or she deems advisable, to determine whether an entity covered under section 2(a) has permanently replaced lawfully striking employees.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:16 --><p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3.

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. It is the policy of the United States to promote the efficient and economical use of America's real property assets and to assure management accountability for implementing Federal real property management reforms. Based on this policy, executive branch departments and agencies shall recognize the importance of real property resources through increased management attention, the establishment of clear goals and objectives, improved policies and levels of accountability, and other appropriate action.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Definition and Scope</em>.

<p class="note-body">(ii) consistent with the real property asset management principles developed by the Federal Real Property Council established in section 4 of this order; and</p>

<p class="note-body">(viii) opportunities for cooperative arrangements with the commercial real estate community; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(ix) the enhancement of Federal agency productivity through an improved working environment.

<p class="note-body">(c) The Council shall serve as a clearinghouse for executive agencies for best practices in evaluating actual progress in the implementation of real property enhancements. The Council shall also work in conjunction with the President's Management Council to assist the efforts of the Senior Real Property Officials and the implementation of agency asset management plans.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The Council shall be organized and hold its first meeting within 60 days of the date of this order. The Council shall hold meetings not less often than once a quarter each fiscal year.</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. Executive Order 12512 of April 29, 1985, is hereby revoked.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9. <em>Judicial Review</em>.
