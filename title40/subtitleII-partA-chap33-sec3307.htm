<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Transmission to Congress of Prospectus of Proposed Project</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To secure consideration for the approval referred to in subsection (a), the Administrator of General Services shall transmit to Congress a prospectus of the proposed facility, including&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
