<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The establishment of policies and procedures that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) allow the payment system and any person involved in the payment system to identify restricted transactions by means of codes in authorization messages or by other means; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) block restricted transactions identified as a result of the policies and procedures developed pursuant to subparagraph (A).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) identify types of policies and procedures, including nonexclusive examples, which would be deemed, as applicable, to be reasonably designed to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit the acceptance of the products or services with respect to each type of restricted transaction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the extent practical, permit any participant in a payment system to choose among alternative means of identifying and blocking, or otherwise preventing or prohibiting the acceptance of the products or services of the payment system or participant in connection with, restricted transactions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) exempt certain restricted transactions or designated payment systems from any requirement imposed under such regulations, if the Secretary and the Board jointly find that it is not reasonably practical to identify and block, or otherwise prevent or prohibit the acceptance of, such transactions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) ensure that transactions in connection with any activity excluded from the definition of unlawful internet gambling in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D)(i) of section 5362(10) are not blocked or otherwise prevented or prohibited by the prescribed regulations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Compliance With Payment System Policies and Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A financial transaction provider shall be considered to be in compliance with the regulations prescribed under subsection (a) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such person relies on and complies with the policies and procedures of a designated payment system of which it is a member or participant to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) identify and block restricted transactions; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) otherwise prevent or prohibit the acceptance of the products or services of the payment system, member, or participant in connection with restricted transactions; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such policies and procedures of the designated payment system comply with the requirements of regulations prescribed under subsection (a).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>No Liability for Blocking or Refusing To Honor Restricted Transactions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person that identifies and blocks a transaction, prevents or prohibits the acceptance of its products or services in connection with a transaction, or otherwise refuses to honor a transaction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that is a restricted transaction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that such person reasonably believes to be a restricted transaction; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) as a designated payment system or a member of a designated payment system in reliance on the policies and procedures of the payment system, in an effort to comply with regulations prescribed under subsection (a),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall not be liable to any party for such action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Regulatory Enforcement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The requirements under this section shall be enforced exclusively by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Federal functional regulators, with respect to the designated payment systems and financial transaction providers subject to the respective jurisdiction of such regulators under section 505(a) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and section 5g of the Commodities Exchange Act; and</p>
