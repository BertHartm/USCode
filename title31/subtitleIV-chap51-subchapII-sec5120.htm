<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1), before clause (A), the word &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;uncurrent&rdquo; as being more precise. The words &ldquo;withdrawn from circulation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;received in the Treasury&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;heretofore or hereafter issued&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;metal from melting the coins&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the resulting metal&rdquo; because of the restatement. The word &ldquo;reminting&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;coinage&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title. The word &ldquo;material&rdquo; is omitted as being included in &ldquo;metal&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;The Secretary shall account&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall be accounted for by entries&rdquo; because of the source provisions restated in section 321 of the revised title. In clause (D), the word &ldquo;face&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;nominal or face&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;coins minted from the metal&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the amount the same will produce in new coin&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2), the words &ldquo;The Secretary shall reimburse&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;fund shall be reimbursed&rdquo; because of the source provisions restated in section 321 of the revised title. The text of 31:317c(proviso) is omitted as obsolete because the statutory limit on the coinage metal fund was removed by the restatement of section 3528 of the Revised Statutes by section 206(a) of the Coinage Act of 1965 (Pub. L. 89&ndash;81, 79 Stat. 256).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;The Secretary shall&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall be destroyed in such manner and under such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe&rdquo; in 31:421 because of the source provisions restated in section 321 of the revised title. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;cancel and destroy&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall be destroyed&rdquo; to conform to subsection (c) and section 5118(c) and (e) of the revised title. The words &ldquo;(by a secure process)&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;may be destroyed by maceration instead of burning to ashes&rdquo; in 31:422 to eliminate unnecessary words and because of the source provisions restated in section 321 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;obsolete, mutilated, and worn .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. withdrawn from circulation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;which by law are required to be taken up, and not reissued, when taken up&rdquo; in 31:421 for consistency with subsection (a) and 12:124. The words &ldquo;United States currency&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;all other notes&rdquo; in 31:421 and &ldquo;All national bank notes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and other obligations of the United States&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;Mutilated United States notes, when replaced according to law&rdquo; are omitted as superseded by the source provisions restated in section 5119(b) of the revised title. The text of the 3d paragraph(words before the first semicolon and between the 2d and last semicolons) under the heading &ldquo;National Currency&rdquo; in section 1 of the Act of June 23, 1874 (ch. 455, 18 Stat. 206), is omitted as executed. In clause (2), the words &ldquo;dispose of the residue of the currency and notes&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;The pulp from such macerated issue shall be disposed of only under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury&rdquo; in 31:422 to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the word &ldquo;currency&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;currency .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unfit for circulation&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;regardless of who is responsible for, and regardless of who performs, such cancellation, destruction, or accounting&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The word &ldquo;record&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;books, documents, papers, and records&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;make .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. easier&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;facilitate&rdquo;, for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.</p>
