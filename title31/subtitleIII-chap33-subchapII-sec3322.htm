In clause (1), the words &ldquo;as required by section 3302 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;with the Treasurer or some one of the assistant treasurers of the United States (subsequently changed to &lsquo;or with one of the depositaries of the United States mentioned in section 476 of this title&rsquo;)&rdquo; because of 31:476.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section&rdquo; are added because of the restatement.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), before clause (1), the word &ldquo;however&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;treasurer or&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete because of the 1st&ndash;4th pars. under the heading &ldquo;Independent Treasury&rdquo; in the Act of May 29, 1920 (ch. 214, 41 Stat. 654). In clause (2), the words &ldquo;rules and&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
