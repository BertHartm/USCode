<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;money&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;money of account&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. As far as can be determined, the phrase &ldquo;money of account&rdquo; has not been interpreted by any court or Government agency. The phrase was used by Alexander Hamilton in his &ldquo;Report on the Establishment of the Mint&rdquo; (1791). In that Report, Hamilton propounded 6 questions, including:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&nbsp;1st. What ought to be the nature of the money unit of the United States?</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Thereafter, Hamilton uses the phrases &ldquo;money unit of the United States&rdquo; and &ldquo;money of account&rdquo; interchangeably and in the sense that the phrases are used to denote the monetary system for keeping financial accounts. In short, the phrases simply indicate that financial accounts are to be based on a decimal money system:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;., and it is certain that nothing can be more simple and convenient than the decimal subdivisions. There is every reason to expect that the method will speedily grow into general use, when it shall be seconded by corresponding coins. On this plan the unit in the money of account will continue to be, as established by that resolution [of August 8, 1786], a dollar, and its multiples, dimes, cents, and mills, or tenths, hundreths, [sic] and thousands.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Thus, the phrase &ldquo;money of account&rdquo; did not mean, by itself, that dollars or fractions of dollars must be equal to something having intrinsic or &ldquo;substantive&rdquo; value. This concept is supported by earlier writings of Thomas Jefferson in his &ldquo;Notes on the Establishment of a Money Unit, and of a Coinage for the United States&rdquo; (1784), and the 1782 report to the President of the Continental Congress on the coinage of the United States by the Superintendent of Finances, Robert Morris, which was apparently prepared by the Assistant Superintendent, Gouverneur Morris. See Paul L. Ford, <em>The Writings of Thomas Jefferson</em>, vol. III (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1894) pp. 446&ndash;457; William G. Sumner, <em>The Financier and the Finances of the American Revolution</em>, vol. II (Burt Franklin, 1891, reprinted 1970) pp. 36&ndash;47; and George T. Curtis, <em>History of the Constitution</em>, vol. I (Harper and Brothers, 1859) p. 443, n2. The words &ldquo;or units&rdquo; and &ldquo;and all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary of the Treasury&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may prepare national medal dies and strike national and other medals if it does not <!-- PDFPage:322 -->interfere with regular minting operations but may not prepare private medal dies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) may prepare and distribute numismatic items; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) may mint coins for a foreign country if the minting does not interfere with regular minting operations, and shall prescribe a charge for minting the foreign coins equal to the cost of the minting (including labor, materials, and the use of machinery).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Department of the Treasury has a coinage metal fund and a coinage profit fund. The Secretary may use the coinage metal fund to buy metal to mint coins. The Secretary shall credit the coinage profit fund with the amount by which the nominal value of the coins minted from the metal exceeds the cost of the metal. The Secretary shall charge the coinage profit fund with waste incurred in minting coins and the cost of distributing the coins, including the cost of coin bags and pallets. The Secretary shall deposit in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts excess amounts in the coinage profit fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Procurements Relating to Coin Production.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may make contracts, on conditions the Secretary decides are appropriate and are in the public interest, to acquire articles, materials, supplies, and services (including equipment, manufacturing facilities, patents, patent rights, technical knowledge, and assistance) necessary to produce the coins referred to in this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Domestic control of coinage</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), in order to protect the national security through domestic control of the coinage process, the Secretary shall acquire only such articles, materials, supplies, and services (including equipment, manufacturing facilities, patents, patent rights, technical knowledge, and assistance) for the production of coins as have been produced or manufactured in the United States unless the Secretary determines it to be inconsistent with the public interest, or the cost to be unreasonable, and publishes in the Federal Register a written finding stating the basis for the determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Subparagraph (A) shall apply only in the case of a bid or offer from a supplier the principal place of business of which is in a foreign country which does not accord to United States companies the same competitive opportunities for procurements in connection with the production of coins as it accords to domestic companies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Determination.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any determination of the Secretary referred to in paragraph (2) shall not be reviewable in any administrative proceeding or court of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Other rights unaffected</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This paragraph does not alter or annul any right of review that arises under any provision of any law or regulation of the United States other than paragraph (2).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Nothing in paragraph (2) of this subsection in any way affects the procurement by the Secretary of gold and silver for the production of coins by the United States Mint.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Secretary may prohibit or limit the exportation, melting, or treatment of United States coins when the Secretary decides the prohibition or limitation is necessary to protect the coinage of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person knowingly violating an order or license issued or regulation prescribed under paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall be fined not more than $10,000, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Coins exported, melted, or treated in violation of an order or license issued or regulation prescribed, and metal resulting from the melting or treatment, shall be forfeited to the United States Government. The powers of the Secretary and the remedies available to enforce forfeitures are those provided in part II of subchapter C of chapter 75 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954&nbsp;<sup><a href="#5111_1_target" name="5111_1">1</a></sup> (26 U.S.C. 7321 et seq.).</p>

Subject to other provisions of this subsection, the obverse of any 5-cent coin issued after December 31, 2005, shall bear the likeness of Thomas Jefferson and the reverse of any such 5-cent coin shall bear an image of the home of Thomas Jefferson at Monticello. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Congress, shall select appropriate designs for the obverse and reverse sides of the dollar coin.

However, to prevent or alleviate a shortage of a denomination, the Secretary may inscribe coins of the denomination with the year that was last inscribed on coins of the denomination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall prepare the devices, models, hubs, and dies for coins, emblems, devices, inscriptions, and designs authorized under this chapter.

The words &ldquo;Any coins minted after July 23, 1965, from 900 fine coin silver shall be inscribed with the year 1964&rdquo; in 31:324 are omitted because the Secretary no longer has authority to mint coins from 900 fine coin silver.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d)(2), the word &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;engraver&rdquo;, &ldquo;Director of the Mint&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Director of the Mint .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury&rdquo; because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title.

The word &ldquo;inscription&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;legend&rdquo; for consistency in the section. The words &ldquo;<em>Provided</em>, That no change be made in the diameter of any coin&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because the diameters are prescribed by subsection (a) of the revised section. The words &ldquo;procure services under section 3109 of title 5 in carrying out this paragraph&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;engage temporarily for this purpose the services of one or more artists, distinguished in their respective departments of art&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.

The words &ldquo;that are metallurgically bonded to&rdquo; are added for clarity and consistency with subsection (b). In clause (4), the words &ldquo;the late President of the United States&rdquo; in 31:324b are omitted as unnecessary. Clause (6) is added because 31:324 applies to coins minted under this subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f)(1), before clause (A), the words &ldquo;Notwithstanding this section and section 5111(a)(1) of this title are substituted for &ldquo;Notwithstanding any other provision of law&rdquo; in 31:399 for clarity.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Yellowstone National Park was established by an Act signed by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872, as the Nation's first national park.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The summer and autumn of 1890 saw the establishment of a number of national sites:</p>

<!-- PDFPage:339 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Theodore Roosevelt was this nation's 26th President and is considered by many to be our &lsquo;Conservationist President&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) As a frequent visitor to the West, Theodore Roosevelt witnessed the virtual destruction of some big game species and the overgrazing that destroyed the grasslands and with them the habitats for small mammals and songbirds and conservation increasingly became one of his major concerns.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) When he became President in 1901, Roosevelt pursued this interest in conservation by establishing the first 51 Bird Reserves, 4 Game Preserves, and 150 National Forests.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) He also established the United States Forest Service, signed into law the creation of 5 National Parks, and signed the Act for the Preservation of American Antiquities in 1906 under which he proclaimed 18 national monuments.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Approximately 230,000,000 acres of area within the United States was placed under public protection by Theodore Roosevelt.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) In addition to the sites within the National Park System, the United States has placed numerous other types of sites under various forms of conservancy, such as the national forests and sites within the National Wildlife Refuge System and on the National Register of Historic Places.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Presidential Commemorative Dollar Coins; Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;145, title I, &sect;101, Dec. 22, 2005, 119 Stat. 2664, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) There are sectors of the United States economy, including public transportation, parking meters, vending machines, and low-dollar value transactions, in which the use of a $1 coin is both useful and desirable for keeping costs and prices down.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) For a variety of reasons, the new $1 coin introduced in 2000 has not been widely sought-after by the public, leading to higher costs for merchants and thus higher prices for consumers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The success of the 50 States Commemorative Coin Program (31 U.S.C. 5112(<em>l</em>)) for circulating quarter dollars shows that a design on a United States circulating coin that is regularly changed in a manner similar to the systematic change in designs in such Program radically increases demand for the coin, rapidly pulling it through the economy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The 50 States Commemorative Coin Program also has been an educational tool, teaching both Americans and visitors something about each State for which a quarter has been issued.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) A national survey and study by the Government Accountability Office has indicated that many Americans who do not seek, or who reject, the new $1 coin for use in commerce would actively seek the coin if an attractive, educational rotating design were to be struck on the coin.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The President is the leader of our tripartite government and the President's spouse has often set the social tone for the White House while spearheading and highlighting important issues for the country.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Sacagawea, as currently represented on the new $1 coin, is an important symbol of American history.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Many people cannot name all of the Presidents, and fewer can name the spouses, nor can many people accurately place each President in the proper time period of American history.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) First Spouses have not generally been recognized on American coinage.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) In order to revitalize the design of United States coinage and return circulating coinage to its position as not only a necessary means of exchange in commerce, but also as an object of aesthetic beauty in its own right, it is appropriate to move many of the mottos and emblems, the inscription of the year, and the so-called &lsquo;mint marks&rsquo; that currently appear on the 2 faces of each circulating coin to the edge of the coin, which would allow larger and more dramatic artwork on the coins reminiscent of the so-called &lsquo;Golden Age of Coinage&rsquo; in the United States, at the beginning of the Twentieth Century, initiated by President Theodore Roosevelt, with the assistance of noted sculptors and medallic artists James Earle Fraser and Augustus Saint-Gaudens.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Placing inscriptions on the edge of coins, known as edge-incusing, is a hallmark of modern coinage and is common in large-volume production of coinage elsewhere in the world, such as the 2,700,000,000 2-Euro coins in circulation, but it has not been done on a large scale in United States coinage in recent years.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Although the Congress has authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue gold coins with a purity of 99.99 percent, the Secretary has not done so.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) Bullion coins are a valuable tool for the investor and, in some cases, an important aspect of coin collecting.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 301. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, was one of the Nation's greatest leaders, demonstrating true courage during the Civil War, one of the greatest crises in the Nation's history.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Born of humble roots in Hardin County (present-day LaRue County), Kentucky, on February 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln rose to the Presidency through a combination of honesty, integrity, intelligence, and commitment to the United States.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:340 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) With the belief that all men are created equal, Abraham Lincoln led the effort to free all slaves in the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Abraham Lincoln had a generous heart, with malice toward none, and with charity for all.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Abraham Lincoln gave the ultimate sacrifice for the country he loved, dying from an assassin's bullet on April 15, 1865.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of Abraham Lincoln, for Lincoln's life is a model for accomplishing the &lsquo;American dream&rsquo; through honesty, integrity, loyalty, and a lifetime of education.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The year 2009 will be the bicentennial anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky, grew to adulthood in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, and led the nation in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The so-called &lsquo;Lincoln cent&rsquo; was introduced in 1909 on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, making the obverse design the most enduring on the nation's coinage.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) President Theodore Roosevelt was so impressed by the talent of Victor David Brenner that the sculptor was chosen to design the likeness of President Lincoln for the coin, adapting a design from a plaque Brenner had prepared earlier.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) In the nearly 100 years of production of the &lsquo;Lincoln cent&rsquo;, there have been only 2 designs on the reverse: the original, featuring 2 wheat-heads in memorial style enclosing mottoes, and the current representation of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) On the occasion of the bicentennial of President Lincoln's birth and the 100th anniversary of the production of the Lincoln cent, it is entirely fitting to issue a series of 1-cent coins with designs on the reverse that are emblematic of the 4 major periods of President Lincoln's life.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 302. REDESIGN OF LINCOLN CENT FOR 2009.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;During the year 2009, the Secretary of the Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in accordance with the following design specifications:</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) his formative years in Indiana;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) his professional life in Illinois; and</p>

The words &ldquo;other security documents and checks&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;checks&rdquo; because only currency and bonds must be printed from intaglio plates.

The words &ldquo;At such time as new dies for the printing of currency are adopted&rdquo; are omitted as executed. The words &ldquo;and thereafter this inscription shall appear on all United States currency and coins&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement of the source provisions in this subsection and section 5112(d) of the revised title.

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) With the approval of the President, the Secretary of the Treasury may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) buy and sell gold in the way, in amounts, at rates, and on conditions the Secretary considers most advantageous to the public interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) buy the gold with any direct obligations of the United States Government or United States coins and currency authorized by law, or with amounts in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amounts received from the purchase of gold are an asset of the general fund of the Treasury. Amounts received from the sale of gold shall be deposited by the Secretary in the general fund of the Treasury and shall be used for the sole purpose of reducing the national debt.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall acquire gold for the coins issued under section 5112(i) of this title by purchase of gold mined from natural deposits in the United States, or in a territory or possession of the United States, within one year after the month in which the ore from which it is derived was mined. The Secretary shall pay not more than the average world price for the gold. In the absence of available supplies of such gold at the average world price, the Secretary may use gold from reserves held by the United States to mint the coins issued under section 5112(i) of this title. The Secretary shall issue such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary may buy silver mined from natural deposits in the United States, or in <!-- PDFPage:346 -->a territory or possession of the United States, that is brought to a United States mint or assay office within one year after the month in which the ore from which it is derived was mined. The Secretary may use the coinage metal fund under section 5111(b) of this title to buy silver under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may sell or use Government silver to mint coins, except silver transferred to stockpiles established under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.). The Secretary shall obtain the silver for the coins authorized under section 5112(e) of this title by purchase from stockpiles established under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.). At such time as the silver stockpile is depleted, the Secretary shall obtain silver as described in paragraph (1) to mint coins authorized under section 5112(e). If it is not economically feasible to obtain such silver, the Secretary may obtain silver for coins authorized under section 5112(e) from other available sources. The Secretary shall not pay more than the average world price for silver under any circumstances. As used in this paragraph, the term &ldquo;average world price&rdquo; means the price determined by a widely recognized commodity exchange at the time the silver is obtained by the Secretary. The Secretary shall sell silver under conditions the Secretary considers appropriate for at least $1.292929292 a fine troy ounce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) cast gold and silver bullion deposits into bars; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) cast alloys into bars for minting coins.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A person owning gold or silver bullion may deposit the bullion with the Secretary to be cast into fine, standard fineness, or unrefined bars weighing at least 5 troy ounces. When practicable, the Secretary shall weigh the bullion in front of the depositor. The Secretary shall give the depositor a receipt for the bullion stating the description and weight of the bullion. When the Secretary has to melt the bullion or remove base metals before the value of the bullion can be determined, the weight is the weight after the melting or removal of the metals. The Secretary may refuse a deposit of gold bullion if the deposit is less than $100 in value or the bullion is so base that it is unsuitable for the operations of the Bureau of the Mint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When the gold and silver are combined in bullion that is deposited and either the gold or silver is so little that it cannot be separated economically, the Secretary may not pay the depositor for the gold or silver that cannot be separated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, a person may exchange unrefined bullion for fine bars when&mdash;</p>

However, the fund is not available to pay administrative expenses.</p>

However, a loan or credit to a foreign entity or government of a foreign country may be made for more than 6 months in any 12-month period only if the President gives Congress a written statement that unique or emergency circumstances require the loan or credit be for more than 6 months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) By the 30th day after the end of each month, the Secretary shall give the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate a detailed financial statement on the stabilization fund showing all agreements made or renewed, all transactions occurring during the month, and all projected liabilities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) A repayment of any part of the first subscription payment of the Government to the International Monetary Fund, previously paid from the stabilization fund, shall be deposited in the Treasury as a miscellaneous receipt.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;458, title VII, &sect;&sect;7701, 7702, 7704, Dec. 17, 2004, 118 Stat. 3858&ndash;3860, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 7701. IMPROVING INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND COOPERATION TO FIGHT TERRORIST FINANCING.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The global war on terrorism and cutting off terrorist financing is a policy priority for the United States and its partners, working bilaterally and multilaterally through the United Nations, the United Nations Security Council and its committees, such as the 1267 and 1373 Committees, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), and various international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), and the regional multilateral development banks, and other multilateral fora.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The international financial community has become engaged in the global fight against terrorist financing. The Financial Action Task Force has focused on the new threat posed by terrorist financing to the international financial system, resulting in the establishment of the FATF's Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing as the international standard on combating terrorist financing. The Group of Seven and the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers are developing action plans to curb the financing of terror. In addition, other economic and regional fora, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum, and the Western Hemisphere Financial Ministers, have been used to marshal political will and actions in support of combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) standards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) FATF's Forty Recommendations on Money Laundering and the Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing are the recognized global standards for fighting money laundering and terrorist financing. The FATF has engaged in an assessment process for jurisdictions based on their compliance with these standards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) In March 2004, the IMF and IBRD Boards agreed to make permanent a pilot program of collaboration with the FATF to assess global compliance with the FATF Forty Recommendations on Money Laundering and the Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing. As a result, anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) assessments are now a regular part of their Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Offshore Financial Center assessments, which provide for a comprehensive analysis of the strength of a jurisdiction's financial system. These reviews assess potential systemic vulnerabilities, consider sectoral development needs and priorities, and review the state of implementation of and compliance with key financial codes and regulatory standards, among them the AML and CFT standards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) To date, 70 FSAPs have been conducted, with over 24 of those incorporating AML and CFT assessments. The international financial institutions (IFIs), the FATF, and the FATF-style regional bodies together are expected to assess AML and CFT regimes in up to 40 countries or jurisdictions per year. This will help countries and jurisdictions identify deficiencies in their AML and CFT regimes and help focus technical assistance efforts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Technical assistance programs from the United States and other nations, coordinated with the Department of State and other departments and agencies, are playing an important role in helping countries and jurisdictions address shortcomings in their AML and CFT regimes and bringing their regimes into conformity with international standards. Training is coordinated within the United States Government, which leverages multilateral organizations and bodies and international financial institutions to internationalize the conveyance of technical assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) In fulfilling its duties in advancing incorporation of AML and CFT standards into the IFIs as part of the IFIs&rsquo; work on protecting the integrity of the international monetary system, the Department of the Treasury, under the guidance of the Secretary of the Treasury, has effectively brought together all of the key United States Government agencies. In particular, United States Government agencies continue to work together to foster broad support for this important undertaking in various multilateral fora, and United States Government agencies recognize the need for close coordination and communication within our own Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Sense of Congress Regarding Success in Multilateral Organizations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury should continue to promote the dissemination of international AML and CFT standards, and to press for full implementation of the FATF 40 + 8 Recommendations by all countries in order to curb financial risks and hinder terrorist financing around the globe. The efforts of the Secretary in this regard should include, where necessary or appropriate, multilateral action against countries whose counter-money laundering regimes and efforts against the financing of terrorism fall below recognized international standards.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001; Findings and Purposes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;56, title III, &sect;302, Oct. 26, 2001, 115 Stat. 296, as amended by Pub. L. 108&ndash;458, title VI, &sect;6202(c), Dec. 17, 2004, 118 Stat. 3745, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) money laundering, estimated by the International Monetary Fund to amount to between 2 and 5 percent of global gross domestic product, which is at least $600,000,000,000 annually, provides the financial fuel that permits transnational criminal enterprises to conduct and expand their operations to the detriment of the safety and security of American citizens;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) money laundering, and the defects in financial transparency on which money launderers rely, are critical to the financing of global terrorism and the provision of funds for terrorist attacks;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) money launderers subvert legitimate financial mechanisms and banking relationships by using them as protective covering for the movement of criminal proceeds and the financing of crime and terrorism, and, by so doing, can threaten the safety of United States citizens and undermine the integrity of United States financial institutions and of the global financial and trading systems upon which prosperity and growth depend;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) certain jurisdictions outside of the United States that offer &lsquo;offshore&rsquo; banking and related facilities designed to provide anonymity, coupled with weak financial supervisory and enforcement regimes, provide essential tools to disguise ownership and movement of criminal funds derived from, or used to commit, offenses ranging from narcotics trafficking, terrorism, arms smuggling, and trafficking in human beings, to financial frauds that prey on law-abiding citizens;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) transactions involving such offshore jurisdictions make it difficult for law enforcement officials and regulators to follow the trail of money earned by criminals, organized international criminal enterprises, and global terrorist organizations;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) correspondent banking facilities are one of the banking mechanisms susceptible in some circumstances to manipulation by foreign banks to permit the laundering of funds by hiding the identity of real parties in interest to financial transactions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) private banking services can be susceptible to manipulation by money launderers, for example corrupt foreign government officials, particularly if those services include the creation of offshore accounts and facilities for large personal funds transfers to channel funds into accounts around the globe;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) United States anti-money laundering efforts are impeded by outmoded and inadequate statutory provisions that make investigations, prosecutions, and forfeitures more difficult, particularly in cases in which money laundering involves foreign persons, foreign banks, or foreign countries;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the ability to mount effective counter-measures to international money launderers requires national, as well as bilateral and multilateral action, using tools specially designed for that effort; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices and the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, of both of which the United States is a member, have each adopted international anti-money laundering principles and recommendations.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this title [see Short Title of 2001 Amendment note set out under section 5301 of this title] are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to increase the strength of United States measures to prevent, detect, and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism;</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) the purposes of such provisions of law continue to be fulfilled, and such provisions of law are effectively and efficiently administered;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to strengthen the provisions put into place by the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 (18 U.S.C. 981 note) [see Short Title of 1986 Amendment note set out under section 981 of Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure], especially with respect to crimes by non-United States nationals and foreign financial institutions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to provide a clear national mandate for subjecting to special scrutiny those foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions operating outside of the United States, and classes of international transactions or types of accounts that pose particular, identifiable opportunities for criminal abuse;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to provide the Secretary of the Treasury (in this title referred to as the &lsquo;Secretary&rsquo;) with broad discretion, subject to the safeguards provided by the Administrative Procedure Act under title 5, United States Code [5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., 701 et seq.], to take measures tailored to the particular money laundering problems presented by specific foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions operating outside of the United States, and classes of international transactions or types of accounts;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) to ensure that the employment of such measures by the Secretary permits appropriate opportunity for comment by affected financial institutions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) to provide guidance to domestic financial institutions on particular foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions operating outside of the United States, and classes of international transactions or types of accounts that are of primary money laundering concern to the United States Government;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) to ensure that the forfeiture of any assets in connection with the anti-terrorist efforts of the United States permits for adequate challenge consistent with providing due process rights;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) to clarify the terms of the safe harbor from civil liability for filing suspicious activity reports;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) to strengthen the authority of the Secretary to issue and administer geographic targeting orders, and to clarify that violations of such orders or any other requirement imposed under the authority contained in chapter 2 of title I of Public Law 91&ndash;508 [12 U.S.C. 1951 et seq.] and subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, may result in criminal and civil penalties;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) to ensure that all appropriate elements of the financial services industry are subject to appropriate requirements to report potential money laundering transactions to proper authorities, and that jurisdictional disputes do not hinder examination of compliance by financial institutions with relevant reporting requirements;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) to strengthen the ability of financial institutions to maintain the integrity of their employee population; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) to strengthen measures to prevent the use of the United States financial system for personal gain by corrupt foreign officials and to facilitate the repatriation of any stolen assets to the citizens of countries to whom such assets belong.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Bulk Cash Smuggling Into or Out of the United States</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;56, title III, &sect;371(a), (b), Oct. 26, 2001, 115 Stat. 336, 337, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Effective enforcement of the currency reporting requirements of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, and the regulations prescribed under such subchapter, has forced drug dealers and other criminals engaged in cash-based businesses to avoid using traditional financial institutions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In their effort to avoid using traditional financial institutions, drug dealers and other criminals are forced to move large quantities of currency in bulk form to and through the airports, border crossings, and other ports of entry where the currency can be smuggled out of the United States and placed in a foreign financial institution or sold on the black market.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The transportation and smuggling of cash in bulk form may now be the most common form of money laundering, and the movement of large sums of cash is one of the most reliable warning signs of drug trafficking, terrorism, money laundering, racketeering, tax evasion and similar crimes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The intentional transportation into or out of the United States of large amounts of currency or monetary instruments, in a manner designed to circumvent the mandatory reporting provisions of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code,, [sic] is the equivalent of, and creates the same harm as, the smuggling of goods.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The arrest and prosecution of bulk cash smugglers are important parts of law enforcement's effort to stop the laundering of criminal proceeds, but the couriers who attempt to smuggle the cash out of the United States are typically low-level employees of large criminal organizations, and thus are easily replaced. Accordingly, only the confiscation of the smuggled bulk cash can effectively break the cycle of criminal activity of which the laundering of the bulk cash is a critical part.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The current penalties for violations of the currency reporting requirements are insufficient to provide a deterrent to the laundering of criminal proceeds. In particular, in cases where the only criminal violation under current law is a reporting offense, the law does not adequately provide for the confiscation of smuggled currency. In contrast, if the smuggling of bulk cash were itself an offense, the cash could be confiscated as the corpus delicti of the smuggling offense.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this section [enacting this section] are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to make the act of smuggling bulk cash itself a criminal offense;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to authorize forfeiture of any cash or instruments of the smuggling offense; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to emphasize the seriousness of the act of bulk cash smuggling.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings and Purpose.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Money laundering and related financial crimes frequently appear to be concentrated <!-- PDFPage:410 -->in particular geographic areas, financial systems, industry sectors, or financial institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) While the Secretary has the responsibility to act with regard to Federal offenses which are being committed in a particular locality or are directed at a single institution, because modern financial systems and institutions are interconnected to a degree which was not possible until recently, money laundering and other related financial crimes are likely to have local, State, national, and international effects wherever they are committed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Purpose and objective</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the purpose of this section to provide a mechanism for designating any area where money laundering or a related financial crime appears to be occurring at a higher than average rate such that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a comprehensive approach to the problem of such crime in such area can be developed, in cooperation with State and local law enforcement agencies, which utilizes the authority of the Secretary to prevent such activity; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such area can be targeted for law enforcement action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Element of National Strategy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The designation of certain areas as areas in which money laundering and related financial crimes are extensive or present a substantial risk shall be an element of the national strategy developed pursuant to section 5341(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Designation of Areas.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Designation by secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary, after taking into consideration the factors specified in subsection (d), shall designate any geographical area, industry, sector, or institution in the United States in which money laundering and related financial crimes are extensive or present a substantial risk as a &ldquo;high-risk money laundering and related financial crimes area&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Case-by-case determination in consultation with the attorney general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In addition to the factors specified in subsection (d), any designation of any area under paragraph (1) shall be made on the basis of a determination by the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, that the particular area, industry, sector, or institution is being victimized by, or is particularly vulnerable to, money laundering and related financial crimes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Specific initiatives</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any head of a department, bureau, or law enforcement agency, including any State or local prosecutor, involved in the detection, prevention, and suppression of money laundering and related financial crimes and any State or local official or prosecutor may submit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a written request for the designation of any area as a high-risk money laundering and related financial crimes area; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a written request for funding under section 5351 for a specific prevention or enforcement initiative, or to determine the extent of financial criminal activity, in an area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Factors</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In considering the designation of any area as a high-risk money laundering and related financial crimes area, the Secretary shall, to the extent appropriate and in consultation with the Attorney General, take into account the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The population of the area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The number of bank and nonbank financial institution transactions which originate in such area or involve institutions located in such area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The number of stock or commodities transactions which originate in such area or involve institutions located in such area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Whether the area is a key transportation hub with any international ports or airports or an extensive highway system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Whether the area is an international center for banking or commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The extent to which financial crimes and financial crime-related activities in such area are having a harmful impact in other areas of the country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The number or nature of requests for information or analytical assistance which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are made to the analytical component of the Department of the Treasury; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) originate from law enforcement or regulatory authorities located in such area or involve institutions or businesses located in such area or residents of such area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The volume or nature of suspicious activity reports originating in the area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The volume or nature of currency transaction reports or reports of cross-border movements of currency or monetary instruments originating in, or transported through, the area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Whether, and how often, the area has been the subject of a geographical targeting order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Observed changes in trends and patterns of money laundering activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Unusual patterns, anomalies, growth, or other changes in the volume or nature of core economic statistics or indicators.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) Statistics or indicators of unusual or unexplained volumes of cash transactions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Unusual patterns, anomalies, or changes in the volume or nature of transactions conducted through financial institutions operating within or outside the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) The extent to which State and local governments and State and local law enforcement agencies have committed resources to respond to the financial crime problem in the area and the degree to which the commitment of such resources reflects a determination by such government and agencies to address the problem aggressively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) The extent to which a significant increase in the allocation of Federal resources to combat financial crimes in such area is necessary to provide an adequate State and local response to financial crimes and financial crime-related activities in such area.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Internet gambling is primarily funded through personal use of payment system instruments, credit cards, and wire transfers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The National Gambling Impact Study Commission in 1999 recommended the passage of legislation to prohibit wire transfers to Internet gambling sites or the banks which represent such sites.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Internet gambling is a growing cause of debt collection problems for insured depository institutions and the consumer credit industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) New mechanisms for enforcing gambling laws on the Internet are necessary because traditional law enforcement mechanisms are often inadequate for enforcing gambling prohibitions or regulations on the Internet, especially where such gambling crosses State or national borders.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Rule of Construction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No provision of this subchapter shall be construed as altering, limiting, or extending any Federal or State law or Tribal-State compact prohibiting, permitting, or regulating gambling within the United States.</p>
