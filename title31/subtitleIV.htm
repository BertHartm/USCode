<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;money&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;money of account&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. As far as can be determined, the phrase &ldquo;money of account&rdquo; has not been interpreted by any court or Government agency. The phrase was used by Alexander Hamilton in his &ldquo;Report on the Establishment of the Mint&rdquo; (1791). In that Report, Hamilton propounded 6 questions, including:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&nbsp;1st. What ought to be the nature of the money unit of the United States?</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Thereafter, Hamilton uses the phrases &ldquo;money unit of the United States&rdquo; and &ldquo;money of account&rdquo; interchangeably and in the sense that the phrases are used to denote the monetary system for keeping financial accounts. In short, the phrases simply indicate that financial accounts are to be based on a decimal money system:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;., and it is certain that nothing can be more simple and convenient than the decimal subdivisions. There is every reason to expect that the method will speedily grow into general use, when it shall be seconded by corresponding coins. On this plan the unit in the money of account will continue to be, as established by that resolution [of August 8, 1786], a dollar, and its multiples, dimes, cents, and mills, or tenths, hundreths, [sic] and thousands.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Thus, the phrase &ldquo;money of account&rdquo; did not mean, by itself, that dollars or fractions of dollars must be equal to something having intrinsic or &ldquo;substantive&rdquo; value. This concept is supported by earlier writings of Thomas Jefferson in his &ldquo;Notes on the Establishment of a Money Unit, and of a Coinage for the United States&rdquo; (1784), and the 1782 report to the President of the Continental Congress on the coinage of the United States by the Superintendent of Finances, Robert Morris, which was apparently prepared by the Assistant Superintendent, Gouverneur Morris. See Paul L. Ford, <em>The Writings of Thomas Jefferson</em>, vol. III (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1894) pp. 446&ndash;457; William G. Sumner, <em>The Financier and the Finances of the American Revolution</em>, vol. II (Burt Franklin, 1891, reprinted 1970) pp. 36&ndash;47; and George T. Curtis, <em>History of the Constitution</em>, vol. I (Harper and Brothers, 1859) p. 443, n2. The words &ldquo;or units&rdquo; and &ldquo;and all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The dollar, half dollar, quarter dollar, and dime coins are clad coins with 3 layers of metal. The 2 identical outer layers are an alloy of 75 percent copper and 25 percent nickel. The inner layer is copper. The outer layers are metallurgically bonded to the inner layer and weigh at least 30 percent of the weight of the coin. The 5-cent coin is an alloy of 75 percent copper and 25 percent nickel. In minting 5-cent coins, the Secretary shall use bars that vary not more than 2.5 percent from the percent of nickel required. Except as provided under subsection (c) of this section, the one-cent coin is an alloy of 95 percent copper and 5 percent zinc.

The obverse side of the dollar has the likeness of Susan B. Anthony. The coins have an inscription of the year of minting or issuance. However, to prevent or alleviate a shortage of a denomination, the Secretary may inscribe coins of the denomination with the year that was last inscribed on coins of the denomination.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words before clause (1) are added because of the restatement. In clause (5), the words &ldquo;that is 0.835 inch in diameter&rdquo; are added because the Secretary of the Treasury has prescribed the diameter and the diameter of a coin may not be changed under 31:276. The words &ldquo;5 grams&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;seventy-seven and sixteen-hundredths grains troy&rdquo; for consistency in the revised chapter. In clause (6), the words &ldquo;that is 0.75 inch in diameter&rdquo; are added because the Secretary has prescribed the diameter and the diameter of a coin may not be changed under 31:276. The words &ldquo;except as provided under subsection (c) of this section&rdquo; are added for clarity and because of the restatement. The words &ldquo;3.11 grams&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;forty-eight grains&rdquo; for consistency in the revised chapter.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;In minting 5-cent coins&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;in minor-coinage alloys&rdquo; in 31:346 because 5-cent coins are the minor coins composed of nickel. The words &ldquo;Secretary shall use&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall be used&rdquo; because of the source provisions restated in section 321 of the revised title. The word &ldquo;bars&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;ingots&rdquo; for consistency in the revised chapter. The words &ldquo;2.5 percent&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;twenty-five thousandths&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words &ldquo;from the percent of nickel required&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the legal standard .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the proportion of nickel&rdquo; because of the restatement. The words &ldquo;In silver ingots, six-thousandths&rdquo; are omitted as superseded by the source provisions restated in the section. The words &ldquo;In gold ingots, one-thousandth&rdquo; in section 3533 of the Revised Statutes are omitted because gold coinage was discontinued by 31:315b. The words &ldquo;Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section&rdquo; are added for clarity and because of the restatement.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;a different weight and alloy of copper and zinc&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;such action&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d)(1), the words &ldquo;an impression emblematic of liberty&rdquo; in 31:324 are omitted as obsolete. The words &ldquo;The design on the reverse side of the dollar, half dollar, and quarter dollar is an eagle&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;and upon the reverse side shall be the figure or representation of an eagle .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but on the dime, 5-, and 1-cent piece, the figure of the eagle shall be omitted&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;The emblem on the obverse side of the dollar is&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;The one-dollar coin authorized by section 391(c) of this title shall bear on the obverse side&rdquo; in 31:324b&ndash;1, to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;Any coins minted after July 23, 1965, from 900 fine coin silver shall be inscribed with the year 1964&rdquo; in 31:324 are omitted because the Secretary no longer has authority to mint coins from 900 fine coin silver.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d)(2), the word &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;engraver&rdquo;, &ldquo;Director of the Mint&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Director of the Mint .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury&rdquo; because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. The word &ldquo;dies&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;from the original dies already authorized all the working dies required for use in the coinage of the several mints&rdquo; and &ldquo;original dies&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The word &ldquo;inscription&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;legend&rdquo; for consistency in the <!-- PDFPage:236 -->section. The words &ldquo;<em>Provided</em>, That no change be made in the diameter of any coin&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because the diameters are prescribed by subsection (a) of the revised section. The words &ldquo;procure services under section 3109 of title 5 in carrying out this paragraph&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;engage temporarily for this purpose the services of one or more artists, distinguished in their respective departments of art&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;who shall be paid for such service from the contingent appropriation for the mint at Philadelphia&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete. The text of section 3510(2d proviso) of the Revised Statutes is omitted as executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e)(2), the words &ldquo;80 percent&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;eight hundred parts&rdquo; in 31:391(d), and the words &ldquo;20 percent&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;two hundred parts&rdquo;, for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The words &ldquo;that are metallurgically bonded to&rdquo; are added for clarity and consistency with subsection (b). In clause (4), the words &ldquo;the late President of the United States&rdquo; in 31:324b are omitted as unnecessary. Clause (6) is added because 31:324 applies to coins minted under this subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f)(1), before clause (A), the words &ldquo;Notwithstanding this section and section 5111(a)(1) of this title are substituted for &ldquo;Notwithstanding any other provision of law&rdquo; in 31:399 for clarity. In clause (B), the words &ldquo;are an alloy of 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;be minted in accordance with the standard established in section 3514 of the Revised Statutes (31 U.S.C. 321)&rdquo; and 31:321 to eliminate unnecessary words and for clarity. In clause (C), the word &ldquo;symbolizing&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;emblematic&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f)(2), the words &ldquo;under such regulations as he may prescribe&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of section 321 of the revised title. The word &ldquo;Treasury&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;general fund of the Treasury&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">The text of 31:399(b)(3) is omitted as unnecessary because of section 5103 of the revised title.</p>

The Secretary may issue gold certificates against other gold held in the Treasury. The Secretary may prescribe the form and denominations of the certificates. The amount of outstanding certificates may be not more than the value (for the purpose of issuing those certificates, of 42 and two-ninths dollars a fine troy ounce) of the gold held against gold certificates.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as required, assay coins, metal, and bullion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) cast gold and silver bullion deposits into bars; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:246 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) cast alloys into bars for minting coins.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A person owning gold or silver bullion may deposit the bullion with the Secretary to be cast into fine, standard fineness, or unrefined bars weighing at least 5 troy ounces. When practicable, the Secretary shall weigh the bullion in front of the depositor. The Secretary shall give the depositor a receipt for the bullion stating the description and weight of the bullion. When the Secretary has to melt the bullion or remove base metals before the value of the bullion can be determined, the weight is the weight after the melting or removal of the metals. The Secretary may refuse a deposit of gold bullion if the deposit is less than $100 in value or the bullion is so base that it is unsuitable for the operations of the Bureau of the Mint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When the gold and silver are combined in bullion that is deposited and either the gold or silver is so little that it cannot be separated economically, the Secretary may not pay the depositor for the gold or silver that cannot be separated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, a person may exchange unrefined bullion for fine bars when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) gold and silver are combined in the bullion in proportions that cannot be economically refined; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary shall prepare bars for payment of deposits. The Secretary shall stamp each bar with a designation of the weight and fineness of the bar and a symbol the Secretary considers suitable to prevent fraudulent imitation of the bar.</p>

Proceeds of sales and investments, earnings, and interest <!-- PDFPage:259 -->shall be paid into the fund and are available to carry out this section. However, the fund is not available to pay administrative expenses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to approval by the President, the fund is under the exclusive control of the Secretary, and may not be used in a way that direct control and custody pass from the President and the Secretary. Decisions of the Secretary are final and may not be reviewed by another officer or employee of the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Consistent with the obligations of the Government in the International Monetary Fund on orderly exchange arrangements and a stable system of exchange rates, the Secretary or an agency designated by the Secretary, with the approval of the President, may deal in gold, foreign exchange, and other instruments of credit and securities the Secretary considers necessary. However, a loan or credit to a foreign entity or government of a foreign country may be made for more than 6 months in any 12-month period only if the President gives Congress a written statement that unique or emergency circumstances require the loan or credit be for more than 6 months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) By the 30th day after the end of each month, the Secretary shall give the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate a detailed financial statement on the stabilization fund showing all agreements made or renewed, all transactions occurring during the month, and all projected liabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall report each year to the President and Congress on the operation of the fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A repayment of any part of the first subscription payment of the Government to the International Monetary Fund, previously paid from the stabilization fund, shall be deposited in the Treasury as a miscellaneous receipt.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) If a report required under section 5316 with respect to any monetary instrument is not filed (or if filed, contains a material omission or misstatement of fact), the instrument and any interest in property, including a deposit in a financial institution, traceable to such instrument may be seized and forfeited to the United States Government. Any property, real or personal, involved in a transaction or attempted transaction in violation of section 5324(b), or any property traceable to such property, may be seized and forfeited to the United States Government. A monetary instrument transported by mail or a common carrier, messenger, or bailee is being transported under this subsection from the time the instrument is delivered to the United States Postal Service, common carrier, messenger, or bailee through the time it is delivered to the addressee, intended recipient, or agent of the addressee or intended recipient without being transported further in, or taken out of, the United States.</p>
