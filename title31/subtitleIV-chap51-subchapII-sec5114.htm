<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;The Secretary of the Treasury shall engrave and print&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;The work of engraving and printing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall be performed at the Treasury Department&rdquo; in 31:415 because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. The words &ldquo;United States currency and security documents of the United States Government and currency and bonds of the United States territories and possessions&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the backs and tints of all United States bonds, the backs and tints of all United States paper money, and the backs and tints of bonds and paper money issued by any of the insular possessions of the United States&rdquo; in 31:177 to eliminate unnecessary words and for clarity and consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;other security documents and checks&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;checks&rdquo; because only currency and bonds must be printed from intaglio plates. The text of 31:177(1st proviso) is omitted as unnecessary because of the authority of the Secretary to engrave and print restated in the subsection and the source provisions restated in section 303 of the revised title. The text of 31:177(last proviso) is omitted as executed. The text of the first and 2d provisos in the 4th paragraph under the heading &ldquo;Engraving and Printing&rdquo; in section 1 of the Act of August 24, 1912 (ch. 355, 37 Stat. 430), is omitted as superseded by 31:177(1st proviso). The words after the semicolon in the 2d paragraph under the heading &ldquo;Bureau of Engraving and Printing&rdquo; of the Act of January 3, 1923 (ch. 22, 42 Stat. 1099), are omitted as executed. The words &ldquo;if the Secretary decides the engraving and printing can be carried out .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as outside the Department&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;provided it can be done there&rdquo; in 31:415 for clarity. The words &ldquo;The Secretary of the Treasury may purchase and provide all the machinery and materials&rdquo; in 31:416 are omitted as being superseded by section 5142 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;and employ such persons and appoint such officers as are necessary for the purpose of section 415 of this title&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of 5:3101. The text of section 3577(words before the semicolon) of the Revised Statutes is omitted as superseded by 31:415.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:279 --><p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;United States currency has the inscription&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the dies shall bear .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the inscription&rdquo; in 31:324a for clarity. The words &ldquo;At such time as new dies for the printing of currency are adopted&rdquo; are omitted as executed. The words &ldquo;and thereafter this inscription shall appear on all United States currency and coins&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement of the source provisions in this subsection and section 5112(d) of the revised title. The words &ldquo;in connection with the current program of the Treasury Department to increase the capacity of presses utilized by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing&rdquo; in the Act of July 11, 1955 (ch. 303, 69 Stat. 290), are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;Only .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of a deceased individual&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;No .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. while the original of such portrait is living&rdquo; in 31:413 for clarity. The words &ldquo;United States currency and obligations&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;bonds, securities, notes, fractional or postal currency of the United States&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;shall be placed upon any of the plates for bonds, securities, notes, and silver certificates of the United States&rdquo; in 31:414 are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;subject to applicable regulations under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended&rdquo; in 31:418 are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;On and after August 11, 1951&rdquo; in 31:418a are omitted as executed. The words &ldquo;received after advertisement&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of 41:252. The words &ldquo;the Secretary decides&rdquo; are added for clarity. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;as may be necessary&rdquo; in 31:419 are omitted as surplus. In clause (2), the word &ldquo;pay&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; for consistency in the revised subsection and with other titles of the United States Code.</p>
