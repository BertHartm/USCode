<p class="note-body">In the section, the word &ldquo;agency&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;executive department or independent establishment of the Government&rdquo; for clarity. See 12 Comp.

The words &ldquo;major organizational unit&rdquo; or &ldquo;unit&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;bureau or office&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;to fill the order&rdquo; or &ldquo;filling the order&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;such requisitioned&rdquo; and &ldquo;as may be requisitioned&rdquo; for clarity and because of the restatement. The words &ldquo;goods or services&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;materials, supplies, equipment, work, or services&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(4), the words &ldquo;the head of the agency decides&rdquo; are added, and the words &ldquo;commercial enterprise&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;private agencies&rdquo;, for clarity. The words &ldquo;by competitive bids&rdquo; are omitted as surplus because of various procurement laws.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;The Secretary of Defense&rdquo; are added for clarity because of Comptroller General decision B&ndash;20179 (Apr. 1, 1981).

The words &ldquo;Secretary of Transportation in carrying out duties and powers related to aviation and the Coast Guard&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Federal Aviation Agency, Coast Guard&rdquo; to reflect the transfer of those functions to the Secretary of Transportation. The words &ldquo;the Administrator of General Services&rdquo; are added to reflect the transfer of the functions of the Bureau of Federal Supply of the Treasury Department to the Administrator by section 102(a) of the Act of June 30, 1949 (40:752(a)). The words &ldquo;the Administrator of&rdquo; are added before &ldquo;Maritime Administration&rdquo; for clarity and consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;pursuant to such order&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (d) is substituted for the source provisions being restated to reflect decisions of the Comptroller General, including 31 Comp. Gen. 83 (1951), 34 Comp. Gen. 418 (1955), 39 Comp. Gen. 317 (1959), and 55 Comp. Gen. 1497 (1976).</p>
