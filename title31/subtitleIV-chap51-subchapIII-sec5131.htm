<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;The Bureau of the Mint has&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;embracing in its organization and under its control all mints .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and all assay offices&rdquo; in 31:251(1st sentence words after 1st comma) because of the restatement and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;for the manufacture of coin .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the stamping of bars, which have been, or which may be, authorized by law&rdquo; are omitted as superseded by the source provisions restated in subsection (b).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;The Secretary of the Treasury shall carry out duties and powers&rdquo; are added because of the source provisions restated in section 321 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;related to refining and assaying bullion, minting coins, striking medals, and numismatic items at the mints and assay offices&rdquo; are substituted for 31:278(1st sentence words before comma), 283(1st&ndash;26th words), and 361(1st sentence words before 1st comma) to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency with the source provisions restated in sections 5111(a)(1)&ndash;(3) and 5120(a) of the revised title. The words &ldquo;and not coin&rdquo; in 31:278 are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The words &ldquo;and no metals shall be purchased for minor coinage&rdquo; are omitted as superseded by section 5111(b) of the revised title. The text of 31:278(2d, last sentences) is omitted as obsolete because the Secretary of the Treasury has authority to mint coins containing silver only under section 5112(e) of the revised title and the Secretary holds sufficient silver to mint those coins. See Sen. Rept. No. 91&ndash;1084 (1970). The words &ldquo;except that until the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the mints of the United States are adequate for the production of ample supplies of coins, its facilities may be used for the production of coins&rdquo; in 31:283(1st sentence) are omitted as superseded by the source provisions restated in the subsection. The words &ldquo;striking&rdquo; and &ldquo;strike&rdquo; are added for consistency with section 5111 of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the text of 31:281(words before semicolon) is omitted as superseded by the source provisions restated in section 321 of the revised title, and 31:281(words after semicolon) is omitted as superseded by the source provisions restated in subsection (d) and by 5:ch. 35, subch. II.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words &ldquo;the mint at Philadelphia&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;any building constructed pursuant to this subchapter&rdquo; because that is the building that was constructed under the subchapter.</p>
