<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;has violated, is violating, or will violate this subchapter&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;has engaged, is engaged, or is about to engage in any acts or practices constituting a violation of the provisions of this chapter&rdquo; in 31:1057 and &ldquo;failed to submit a report required under any rule or regulation issued under this subchapter or has violated any rule or regulation issued hereunder&rdquo; in 31:1143(b)(words before last comma) to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;or a regulation prescribed&rdquo; are added because of the restatement. The words &ldquo;in his discretion&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The word &ldquo;civil&rdquo; is added because of rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 App. U.S.C.). The word &ldquo;possession&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;other place subject to the jurisdiction&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words &ldquo;or to enforce compliance with the subchapter, regulation, or order&rdquo; are substituted for 31:1057(last sentence) and the words &ldquo;a mandatory injunction commanding such person to comply with such rule or regulation&rdquo; in 31:1143(b)(words before last comma) to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;and upon a proper showing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. permanent or&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
