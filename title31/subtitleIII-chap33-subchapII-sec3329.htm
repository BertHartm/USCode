<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a person claiming payment satisfies the Secretary of the right to the amount of the check or warrant (or satisfies the Secretary of Veterans Affairs if the claim represents a payment under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary is reasonably ensured that the person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) will receive the check or warrant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) will be able to negotiate it for full value.</p>
