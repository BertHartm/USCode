<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;director of a disbursing center&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;any regional disbursing officer of the Fiscal Service, Treasury Department&rdquo; to reflect the title of the position now presently authorized. The words &ldquo;dies, resigns, or leaves office&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;In case of the death or of the resignation or separation from office&rdquo; for consistency with other titles of the United States Code. The words &ldquo;designated by an official of the Treasury Department authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury to make such designation&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of the source provisions restated in section 321 of the revised title. The word &ldquo;through&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;for a period of time not to extend beyond&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;as provided by law&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;in the General Accounting Office&rdquo;, for consistency with other titles of the Code. The word &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;Treasurer of the United States&rdquo; because of the source provisions restated in section 321 of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is substituted for 31:1014(last sentence) for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
