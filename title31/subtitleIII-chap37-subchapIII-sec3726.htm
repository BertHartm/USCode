<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Each agency that receives a bill from a carrier or freight forwarder for transporting an individual or property for the United States Government shall verify its correctness (to include transportation rates, freight classifications, or proper combinations thereof), using prepayment audit, prior to payment in accordance with the requirements of this section and regulations prescribed by the Administrator of General Services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator of General Services may exempt bills, a particular mode or modes of transportation, or an agency or subagency from a prepayment audit and verification and in lieu thereof require a postpayment audit, based on cost effectiveness, public interest, or other factors the Administrator considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Expenses for prepayment audits shall be funded by the agency's appropriations used for the transportation services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The audit authority provided to agencies by this section is subject to oversight by the Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Administrator may conduct pre- or post-payment audits of transportation bills of any Federal agency. The number and types of bills audited shall be based on the Administrator's judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Administrator shall adjudicate transportation claims which cannot be resolved by the agency procuring the transportation services, or the carrier or freight-forwarder presenting the bill.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A claim under this section shall be allowed only if it is received by the Administrator not later than 3 years (excluding time of war) after the later of the following dates:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The date a refund for an overpayment for the transportation is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The date a deduction under subsection (d) of this section is made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Not later than 3 years (excluding time of war) after the time a bill is paid, the Government may deduct from an amount subsequently due a carrier or freight forwarder an amount paid on the bill that was greater than the rate allowed under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a lawful tariff under title 49 or on file with the Secretary of Transportation with respect to foreign air transportation (as defined in section 40102(a) of title 49), the Federal Maritime Commission, or a State transportation authority;</p>

<br class="Q04" />

Payment for transportation ordered but not provided may be recovered by deduction or other means.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section does not prevent the Comptroller General from conducting an audit under chapter 35 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) The Administrator of General Services may provide transportation audit and related technical assistance services, on a reimbursable basis, to any other agency. Such reimbursements may be credited to the appropriate revolving fund or appropriation from which the expenses were incurred.</p>
