<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;In addition to the bonds and certificates of indebtedness and war-savings certificates authorized by this Act, and amendments thereto&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;subject to the limitation imposed by section 757b of this title&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The word &ldquo;Government&rdquo; is added for consistency. The words &ldquo;for expenditures authorized by law&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;for the purposes of this Act .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and to meet public expenditures authorized by law&rdquo; for clarity and because they are inclusive. The words &ldquo;under section 3111 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;at or before maturity, of any outstanding bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness, or Treasury bills of the United States&rdquo; because of the restatement. The words &ldquo;denomination or denominations&rdquo; are omitted because section 3121(a) of the revised title consolidates this authority in one section for the various types of debt instruments. The words &ldquo;under section 3121 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;containing such terms and conditions, and at such rate or rates of interest&rdquo; because of the restatement. The words &ldquo;at not less than par (except as provided in section 754b of this title)&rdquo; are omitted as superseded by section 3 of the Public Debt Act of 1942 (ch. 205, 56 Stat. 189), restated in section 3121 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;Notwithstanding section 3121(a)(5) of this title&rdquo; are added for clarity because the section cited contains the general authority to which subsection (a)(last sentence) of this section is an exception.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;at the option of&rdquo; and &ldquo;and under such rules and regulations and during such period as he may prescribe&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c) is substituted for 31:753(c) to eliminate unnecessary words and for clarity and consistency.</p>
