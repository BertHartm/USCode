<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;awards rendered by the Indian Claims Commission&rdquo; are omitted as executed because under 25:70v the Commission was dissolved and all of its outstanding cases were transferred to the Court of Claims. Under 25:70v&ndash;3, judgments on cases transferred to the Court of Claims are judgments under 28:2517 and 2518 and are therefore included under clause (3)(A) of the subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the text of 28:2516(b)(less 1st sentence words after last comma) is omitted as superseded by 31:724a.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1)(A), the words &ldquo;through the day before the date&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;to the date&rdquo; as being more precise.</p>
