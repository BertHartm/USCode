<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Department of the Treasury has a special deposit revolving fund, the &ldquo;Check Forgery Insurance Fund&rdquo;. Amounts may be appropriated to the Fund. The Fund consists of amounts&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) appropriated to the Fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) received under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary of the Treasury shall pay from the Fund to a payee or special endorsee of a check drawn on the Treasury or a depositary designated by the Secretary the amount of the check without interest if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the check was lost or stolen without the fault of the payee or a holder that is a special endorsee and whose endorsement is necessary for further negotiation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the check was negotiated later and paid by the Secretary or a depositary on a forged endorsement of the payee's or special endorsee's name;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the payee or special endorsee has not participated in any part of the proceeds of the negotiation or payment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) recovery from the forger, a transferee, or a party on the check after the forgery has been or may be delayed or unsuccessful.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Notwithstanding section 1306 of this title, a check drawn on a designated depositary may be paid in the currency of a foreign country when the appropriate accountable official authorizes payment in that currency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary shall deposit immediately to the credit of the Fund an amount recovered from a forger or a transferee or party on the check. However, currency of a foreign country recovered because of a forged check drawn on a designated depositary shall be credited to the Fund or to the foreign currency fund that was charged when payment was made under subsection (b) of this section to the payee or special endorsee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) This section does not relieve&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a forger from civil or criminal liability; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a transferee or party on a check after the forgery from liability&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) on the express or implied warranty of prior endorsements of the transferee or party; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to refund amounts to the Secretary.</p>
