<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) buy the gold with any direct obligations of the United States Government or United States coins and currency authorized by law, or with amounts in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amounts received from the purchase of gold are an asset of the general fund of the Treasury. Amounts received from the sale of gold shall be deposited by the Secretary in the general fund of the Treasury and shall be used for the sole purpose of reducing the national debt.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall acquire gold for the coins issued under section 5112(i) of this title by purchase of gold mined from natural deposits in the United States, or in a territory or possession of the United States, within one year after the month in which the ore from which it is derived was mined. The Secretary shall pay not more than the average world price for the gold. In the absence of available supplies of such gold at the average world price, the Secretary may use gold from reserves held by the United States to mint the coins issued under section 5112(i) of this title. The Secretary shall issue such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary may buy silver mined from natural deposits in the United States, or in a territory or possession of the United States, that is brought to a United States mint or assay office within one year after the month in which the ore from which it is derived was mined. The Secretary may use the coinage metal fund under section 5111(b) of this title to buy silver under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may sell or use Government silver to mint coins, except silver transferred to stockpiles established under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.).

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1), the words &ldquo;With the approval of the President&rdquo; are applied to 31:733(words after semicolon) because of 31:822b. The words &ldquo;at home or abroad&rdquo; in 31:733(words after semicolon) and 734 are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;terms and&rdquo; are omitted as included in &ldquo;conditions&rdquo;. The text of 31:733(proviso) is omitted as superseded by the Bretton Woods Agreement Act (22 U.S.C. 286 et seq.) and sections 6 and 9 of the Act of October 19, 1976 (Pub. L. 94&ndash;564, 90 Stat. 2661), repealing 31:449 that provided for parity of the dollar on terms of gold and special drawing rights. The text of 31:734(1st sentence words after semicolon) is omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;coinage metal fund&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;bullion fund&rdquo; in 31:335 as being more precise and because of section 5111 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;after July 23, 1965&rdquo; in 31:394 are omitted as executed. The words &ldquo;to procure bullion for coinage&rdquo; and 31:335(2d&ndash;last sentences) are omitted as obsolete because the Secretary of the Treasury has authority to mint coins containing silver only under section 5112(e) of the revised title and the Secretary holds sufficient silver to mint those coins. See Sen. Rept. No. 91&ndash;1084 (1970).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the word &ldquo;terms&rdquo; is omitted as being included in &ldquo;conditions&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;for at least&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;at a price not less than the monetary value of&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
