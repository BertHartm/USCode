<p class="note-body">In the section, the words &ldquo;government of a foreign country&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;foreign governments&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the text of 31:801 and 802 (related to converting certain obligations of foreign governments into obligations bearing a higher rate of interest or with a longer term to maturity) is omitted as executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the text of 31:804 is omitted as unnecessary. The word &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;terms and conditions&rdquo; because it is inclusive. The words &ldquo;unless otherwise hereafter provided by law&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
