<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;an issue of obligations authorized under this chapter&rdquo; are substituted for 31:761(less proviso) to reflect consolidation of the authority for issues of obligations in the revised chapter and for consistency. The text of 31:757c(e) is omitted as unnecessary and superseded by 39:410. The words &ldquo;out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated&rdquo; in 31:760 are omitted as unnecessary and for consistency. The words &ldquo;to be expended as the Secretary of the Treasury may direct&rdquo; in 31:760 are omitted as surplus. In clause (1), the .2 percent limitation on expenses of bonds referred to in 31:760 is made applicable to a &ldquo;note&rdquo; because of the definition of bond in 31:753(d)(last sentence). The words &ldquo;sections 735 to 738, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 765, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 773 of this title and section 84 of title 12&rdquo; in 31:753(d)(last sentence) are omitted because they refer to sections previously repealed (31:735&ndash;738, 765) or obsolete (31:773, which was superseded by 39:410) and because 12:84 was amended to express the result required by the source provisions by section 10 of the Act of February 25, 1927 (ch. 191, 44 Stat. 1229).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:148 --><p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;appropriation for the specified amount&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;definite appropriation&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;appropriation for an unspecified amount&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;indefinite appropriation&rdquo;, as being more precise. The word &ldquo;only&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;and the indefinite appropriation shall not be available for obligation&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
