<p class="note-body">In the section, the words &ldquo;Comptroller General&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;General Accounting Office&rdquo; for consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is substituted for 31:76(2d sentence words before 3d comma) and 147(related to disbursement) to eliminate unnecessary words and for clarity and consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the word &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;Treasurer&rdquo; because of the source provisions restated in section 321 of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;instead of being specified on the warrant&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The reference to &ldquo;section 3526 of this title&rdquo; is used because section 72, referred to in 31:76, has been omitted from the restatement superseded by 31:82i and 31:82i is restated in section 3526.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the word &ldquo;depositing&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;covering&rdquo; for clarity and consistency.</p>
