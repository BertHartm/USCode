See Sen. Rept. No. 91&ndash;1084 (1970). The words &ldquo;except that until the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the mints of the United States are adequate for the production of ample supplies of coins, its facilities may be used for the production of coins&rdquo; in 31:283(1st sentence) are omitted as superseded by the source provisions restated in the subsection.
