The notice shall state the basis of the finding or holding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Informal Presentation of Evidence</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A unit of general local government may present evidence informally to the Secretary within 30 days after the government receives a notice of noncompliance from the Secretary. Except as provided in subsection (e), the government may present evidence on whether&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Temporary Suspension of Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;By the end of the 30-day period under subsection (b), the Secretary shall decide whether the unit of general local government has not complied with section 6711(a) or (b), unless the government has entered into a compliance agreement under section 6714. If the Secretary decides that the government has not complied, the Secretary shall notify the government of the decision and shall suspend payments to the government under this chapter unless, within 10 days after the government receives notice of the decision, the government&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) enters into a compliance agreement under section 6714; or</p>

The holding of discrimination is conclusive. If the holding is reversed by an appellate court, the Secretary or judge shall end the proceeding.</p>
