<p class="statutory-body">The Comptroller General is authorized to lease or otherwise provide space and services within the General Accounting Office Building to persons, both public and private, or to any department, agency or instrumentality of the United States Government upon such terms and conditions as the Comptroller General deems necessary to protect the public interest. The Comptroller General shall establish a rental rate for such leased space equivalent to the prevailing commercial rate for comparable space devoted to a similar purpose in the vicinity of the General Accounting Office Building. Additionally, the Comptroller General may make available, on occasion, or may lease at such rates and on such other terms and conditions as the Comptroller General deems to be in the public interest, auditoriums, meeting rooms, and lobbies of the General Accounting Office Building to persons, firms, or organizations engaged in cultural, educational, or recreational activities (as defined in section 105 of the Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976 (40 U.S.C. 612a)). The Comptroller General will consult with the Administrator of General Services and will give priority to Federal agencies in filling available space within the General Accounting Office Building. Payments for space or services may be made in advance or by way of reimbursement and shall be deposited to a special account and shall be available for expenditure for operation, maintenance, protection, alteration, or repair of the General Accounting Office Building in such amounts as are specified in annual appropriation Acts without regard to fiscal year limitations.</p>
