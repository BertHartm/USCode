<p class="note-body">In the section, a reference to 31:71 and 471 is omitted because the definitions in the section are not used in 31:71 and 471.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (1), &ldquo;agency&rdquo; (which is defined for purposes of this title in section 101 to mean a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States) is coextensive with and substituted for the term &ldquo;department or establishment&rdquo; which was defined in 31:2 as in part meaning &ldquo;any executive department, independent commission, board, bureau, office, agency, or other establishment of the Government, including any independent regulatory commission or board&rdquo;. This definition merely restates and continues, and does not in any way change or expand, the definition in 31:2. Under that definition, entities such as the Tennessee Valley Authority that have been interpreted to be outside the purview of the definition will continue to be outside the purview in the same manner and to the same extent that they were under 31:2. The words &ldquo;includes the District of Columbia government&rdquo; are used because of existing law but the inclusion of these words is not to be interpreted as construing the extent to which the Dis<!-- PDFPage:85 -->trict of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganizational Act (Pub. L. 93&ndash;198, 87 Stat. 774) supersedes the provisions codified in this title. The words &ldquo;of the United States&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The text of 31:2(2d&ndash;4th pars.) is omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The text of section 2(3d par.) of the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921 (ch. 18, 42 Stat. 20), is omitted as obsolete because of section 501 of the revised title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Except as provided in this chapter, the President shall prescribe the contents and order of statements in the budget on expenditures and estimated expenditures and statements on proposed appropriations and information submitted with the budget and proposed appropriations. The President shall include with the budget and proposed appropriations information on personnel and other objects of expenditure in the way that information was included in the budget for fiscal year 1950. However, the requirement that information be included in the budget in that way may be waived or changed by joint action of the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress. This subsection does not limit the authority of a committee of Congress to request information in a form it prescribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When the President makes a basic change in the form of the budget, the President shall submit with the budget information showing where items in the budget for the prior fiscal year are contained in the present budget. However, the President may change the functional categories in the budget only in consultation with the Committees on Appropriations and on the Budget of both Houses of Congress. Committees of the House of Representatives and Senate shall receive prompt notification of all such changes.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide a description of how the performance goals and objectives are to be achieved, including the operation processes, training, skills and technology, and the human, capital, information, and other resources and strategies required to meet those performance goals and objectives.<sup><a href="#1115_1_target" name="1115_1">1</a></sup></p>

Such alternative form shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) include separate descriptive statements of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) a minimally effective program, and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) For the purpose of complying with this section, an agency may aggregate, disaggregate, or consolidate program activities, except that any aggregation or consolidation may not omit or minimize the significance of any program activity constituting a major function or operation for the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) An agency may submit with its annual performance plan an appendix covering any portion of the plan that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is properly classified pursuant to such Executive order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The functions and activities of this section shall be considered to be inherently Governmental functions. The drafting of performance plans under this section shall be performed only by Federal employees.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) &ldquo;program activity&rdquo; means a specific activity or project as listed in the program and financing schedules of the annual budget of the United States Government; and</p>
