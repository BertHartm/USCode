<p class="note-body">In the section, the words &ldquo;law of the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Act of Congress&rdquo; for clarity. The word &ldquo;grants&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;grants-in-aid&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;grant program&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;grant-in-aid program&rdquo;, for consistency in the chapter.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;grant program&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;program under which such grants-in-aid are made&rdquo; for consistency in the chapter and to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;committees of Congress&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words &ldquo;The committees may conduct&rdquo; are added for clarity. The word &ldquo;report&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;advise&rdquo; for clarity. In clause (2), the word &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;financial assistance from the United States&rdquo; because of the definition in section 6501(1) of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;prior to the expiration of the fourth calendar year beginning after October 16, 1968, and thereafter&rdquo; are omitted as executed.</p>
