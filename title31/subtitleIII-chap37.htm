<p class="statutory-body">(a) The head of an executive or legislative agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall try to collect a claim of the United States Government for money or property arising out of the activities of, or referred to, the agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may compromise a claim of the Government of not more than $100,000 (excluding interest) or such higher amount as the Attorney General may from time to time prescribe that has not been referred to another executive or legislative agency for further collection action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) may suspend or end collection action on a claim referred to in clause (2) of this subsection when it appears that no person liable on the claim has the present or prospective ability to pay a significant amount of the claim or the cost of collecting the claim is likely to be more than the amount recovered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Comptroller General has the same authority that the head of the agency has under subsection (a) of this section when the claim is referred to the Comptroller General for further collection action. Only the Comptroller General may compromise a claim arising out of an exception the Comptroller General makes in the account of an accountable official.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The head of an executive or legislative agency may not act under subsection (a)(2) or (3) of this section on a claim that appears to be fraudulent, false, or misrepresented by a party with an interest in the claim, or that is based on conduct in violation of the antitrust laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation may not compromise for less than $500 a penalty under section 21302 of title 49 for a violation of chapter 203, 205, or 207 of title 49 or a regulation or requirement prescribed or order issued under any of those chapters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A compromise under this section is final and conclusive unless gotten by fraud, misrepresentation, presenting a false claim, or mutual mistake of fact. An accountable official is not liable for an amount paid or for the value of <!-- PDFPage:184 -->property lost or damaged if the amount or value is not recovered because of a compromise under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The head of an executive or legislative agency acts under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) regulations prescribed by the head of the agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) standards that the Attorney General and the Comptroller General may prescribe jointly.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) When trying to collect a claim of the Government under a law except the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), the head of an executive or legislative agency may disclose to a consumer reporting agency information from a system of records that an individual is responsible for a claim if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notice required by section 552a(e)(4) of title 5 indicates that information in the system may be disclosed to a consumer reporting agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the head of the agency has reviewed the claim and decided that the claim is valid and overdue;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the head of the agency has notified the individual in writing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) that payment of the claim is overdue;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) that, within not less than 60 days after sending the notice, the head of the agency intends to disclose to a consumer reporting agency that the individual is responsible for the claim;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) of the specific information to be disclosed to the consumer reporting agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) of the rights the individual has to a complete explanation of the claim, to dispute information in the records of the agency about the claim, and to administrative repeal or review of the claim;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the individual has not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) repaid or agreed to repay the claim under a written repayment plan that the individual has signed and the head of the agency has agreed to; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) filed for review of the claim under paragraph (2) of this subsection;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the head of the agency has established procedures to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) disclose promptly, to each consumer reporting agency to which the original disclosure was made, a substantial change in the condition or amount of the claim;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) verify or correct promptly information about the claim on request of a consumer reporting agency for verification of information disclosed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) get satisfactory assurances from each consumer reporting agency that the agency is complying with all laws of the United States related to providing consumer credit information; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the information disclosed to the consumer reporting agency is limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) information necessary to establish the identity of the individual, including name, address, and taxpayer identification number;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the amount, status, and history of the claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the agency or program under which the claim arose.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before disclosing information to a consumer reporting agency under paragraph (1) of this subsection and at other times allowed by law, the head of an executive or legislative agency shall provide, on request of an individual alleged by the agency to be responsible for the claim, for a review of the obligation of the individual, including an opportunity for reconsideration of the initial decision on the claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Before disclosing information to a consumer reporting agency under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the head of an executive or legislative agency shall take reasonable action to locate an individual for whom the head of the agency does not have a current address to send the notice under paragraph (1)(C).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may change the rate of interest for a calendar quarter if the average investment rate for the 12-month period ending at the close of the prior calendar quarter, rounded to the nearest whole percentage point, is more or less than the existing published rate by 2 percentage points.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Interest under subsection (a) of this section accrues from the date&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on which notice is mailed after October 25, 1982, if notice was first mailed before October 25, 1982; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) notice of the amount due is first mailed to the debtor at the most current address of the debtor available to the head of the executive or legislative agency, if notice is first mailed after October 24, 1982.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3718. Contracts for collection services</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under conditions the head of an executive or legislative agency considers appropriate, the head of the agency may make a contract with a person for collection services to recover indebtedness owed the United States Government. The contract shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the head of the agency retains the authority to resolve a dispute, compromise a claim, end collection action, and refer a matter to the Attorney General to bring a civil action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the person is subject to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) section 552a of title 5, to the extent provided in section 552a(m); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) laws and regulations of the United States Government and State governments related to debt collection practices.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1)(A) The Attorney General may make contracts retaining private counsel to furnish legal services, including representation in negotiation, compromise, settlement, and litigation, in the case of any claim of indebtedness owed the United States. Each such contract shall include such terms and conditions as the Attorney General considers necessary and appropriate, including a provision specifying the amount of the fee to be paid to the private counsel under such contract or the method for calculating that fee. The amount of the fee payable for legal services furnished under any such contract may not exceed the fee that counsel engaged in the private practice of law in the area or areas where the legal services are furnished typically charge clients for furnishing legal services in the collection of claims of indebtedness, as determined by the Attorney General, considering the amount, age, and nature of the indebtedness and whether the debtor is an individual or a business entity. If the Attorney General makes a contract for legal services to be furnished in any judicial district of the United States under the first sentence of this paragraph, the Attorney General shall use his best efforts to obtain, from among attorneys regularly engaged in the private practice of law in such district, at least four such contracts for legal services with private individuals or firms in such district. Nothing in this subparagraph shall relieve the Attorney General of the competition requirements set forth in title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 and following).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Attorney General shall use his best efforts to enter into contracts under this paragraph with law firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, so as to enable each agency to comply with paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an executive or legislative agency may, subject to the approval of the Attorney General, refer to a private counsel retained under paragraph (1) of this subsection claims of indebtedness owed the United States arising out of activities of that agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each agency shall use its best efforts to assure that not less than 10 percent of the amounts of all claims referred to private counsel by that agency under paragraph (2) are referred to law firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the term &ldquo;law firm owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals&rdquo; means a law firm that meets the requirements set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of section 8(d)(3)(C) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(3)(C)(i) and (ii)) and regulations issued under those clauses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) &ldquo;socially and economically disadvantaged individuals&rdquo; shall be presumed to include these groups and individuals described in the last paragraph of section 8(d)(3)(C) of the Small Business Act.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding sections 516, 518(b), 519, and 547(2) of title 28, a private counsel retained under paragraph (1) of this subsection may represent the United States in litigation in connection with legal services furnished pursuant to the contract entered into with that counsel under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A contract made with a private counsel under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a provision permitting the Attorney General to terminate either the contract or the private counsel's representation of the United States in particular cases if the Attorney General finds that such action is for the convenience of the Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a provision stating that the head of the executive or legislative agency which refers a claim under the contract retains the authority to resolve a dispute regarding the claim, to compromise the claim, or to terminate a collection action on the claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a provision requiring the private counsel to transmit monthly to the Attorney General and the head of the executive or legislative agency referring a claim under the contract a report on the services relating to the claim rendered under the contract during the month and the progress made during the month in collecting the claim under the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Notwithstanding the fourth sentence of section 803(6) of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 1692a(6)), a private counsel performing legal services pursuant to a contract made under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be considered to be a debt collector for the purposes of such Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Any counterclaim filed in any action to recover indebtedness owed the United States which is brought on behalf of the United States by private counsel retained under this subsection may not be asserted unless the counterclaim is served directly on the Attorney General or the United States Attorney for the judicial district in which, or embracing the place in which, the action is brought. Such service shall be made in accordance with the rules of procedure of the court in which the action is brought.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Attorney General shall transmit to the Congress an annual report on the activities of the Department of Justice to recover indebtedness owed the United States which was referred to the Department of Justice for collection. Each such report shall include a list, by agency, of&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:190 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the total number and amounts of claims which were referred for legal services to the Department of Justice and to private counsel under subsection (b) during the 1-year period covered by the report;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the total number and amount of those claims referred for legal services to the Department of Justice which were collected or were not collected or otherwise resolved during the 1-year period covered by the report; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the total number and amount of those claims referred for legal services to private counsel under subsection (b)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which were collected or were not collected or otherwise resolved during the 1-year period covered by the report;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which were not collected or otherwise resolved under a contract terminated by the Attorney General during the 1-year period covered by the report; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) on which the Attorney General terminated the private counsel's representation during the 1-year period covered by the report without terminating the contract with the private counsel under which the claims were referred.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Notwithstanding section 3302(b) of this title, a contract under subsection (a) or (b) of this section may provide that a fee a person charges to recover indebtedness owed the United States Government is payable from the amount recovered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A contract under subsection (a) or (b) of this section is effective only to the extent and in the amount provided in an appropriation law. This limitation does not apply in the case of a contract that authorizes a person to collect a fee as provided in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) This section does not apply to the collection of debts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) In order to assist Congress in determining whether use of private counsel is a cost-effective method of collecting Government debts, the Attorney General shall, following consultation with the General Accounting Office, maintain and make available to the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, statistical data relating to the comparative costs of debt collection by participating United States Attorneys&rsquo; Offices and by private counsel.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for the Department of Defense (except the military departments), the Secretary of Defense; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of State may waive the settlement and payment limitation referred to in paragraph (1) for claims for damage or loss by United States Government personnel under the jurisdiction of a chief of mission in a foreign country if such claims arise in circumstances where there is in effect a departure from the country authorized or ordered under circumstances described in section 5522(a) of title 5, if the Secretary determines that there exists exceptional circumstances that warrant such a waiver.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) On paying a claim under this section, the Government is subrogated for the amount of the payment to a right or claim that the claimant may have against a foreign country for the damage or loss for which the Government made the payment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(j) The President may prescribe policies to carry out this section (except subsection (b) to the extent that subsection (b) applies to the military departments, the Department of Defense, and the Coast Guard). Subject to those <!-- PDFPage:195 -->policies, the head of each agency shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3727. Assignments of claims</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section, &ldquo;assignment&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a transfer or assignment of any part of a claim against the United States Government or of an interest in the claim; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the authorization to receive payment for any part of the claim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) An assignment may be made only after a claim is allowed, the amount of the claim is decided, and a warrant for payment of the claim has been issued. The assignment shall specify the warrant, must be made freely, and must be attested to by 2 witnesses. The person making the assignment shall acknowledge it before an official who may acknowledge a deed, and the official shall certify the assignment. The certificate shall state that the official completely explained the assignment when it was acknowledged. An assignment under this subsection is valid for any purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply to an assignment to a financing institution of money due or to become due under a contract providing for payments totaling at least $1,000 when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the contract does not forbid an assignment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) unless the contract expressly provides otherwise, the assignment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is for the entire amount not already paid;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is made to only one party, except that it may be made to a party as agent or trustee for more than one party participating in the financing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may not be reassigned; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the assignee files a written notice of the assignment and a copy of the assignment with the contracting official or the head of the agency, the surety on a bond on the contract, and any disbursing official for the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) During a war or national emergency proclaimed by the President or declared by law and ended by proclamation or law, a contract with the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, the Department of Energy (when carrying out duties and powers formerly carried out by the Atomic Energy Commission), or other agency the President designates may provide, or may be changed without consideration to provide, that a future payment under the contract to an assignee is not subject to reduction or setoff. A payment subsequently due under the contract (even after the war or emergency is ended) shall be paid to the assignee without a reduction or setoff for liability of the assignor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to the Government independent of the contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) because of renegotiation, fine, penalty (except an amount that may be collected or withheld under, or because the assignor does not comply with, the contract), taxes, social security contributions, or withholding or failing to withhold taxes or social security contributions, arising from, or independent of, the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) An assignee under this section does not have to make restitution of, refund, or repay the amount received because of the liability of the assignor to the Government that arises from or is independent of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Government may not collect or reclaim money paid to a person receiving an amount under an assignment or allotment of pay or allowances authorized by law when liability may exist because of the death of the person making the assignment or allotment.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Responsibilities of the Attorney General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Attorney General diligently shall investigate a violation under section 3729. If the Attorney General finds that a person has violated or is violating section 3729, the Attorney General may bring a civil action under this section against the person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Actions by Private Persons</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person may bring a civil action for a violation of section 3729 for the person and for the United States Government. The action shall be brought in the name of the Government. The action may be dismissed only if the court and the Attorney General give written consent to the dismissal and their reasons for consenting.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses shall be served on the Government pursuant to Rule 4(d)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The complaint shall be filed in camera, shall remain under seal for at least 60 days, and shall not be served on the defendant until the court so orders. The Government may elect to intervene and proceed with the action within 60 days after it receives both the complaint and the material evidence and information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Government may, for good cause shown, move the court for extensions of the time during which the complaint remains under seal under paragraph (2). Any such motions may be supported by affidavits or other submissions in camera. The defendant shall not be required to respond to any complaint filed under this section until 20 days after the complaint is unsealed and served upon the defendant pursuant to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Before the expiration of the 60-day period or any extensions obtained under paragraph (3), the Government shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) proceed with the action, in which case the action shall be conducted by the Government; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) notify the court that it declines to take over the action, in which case the person bringing the action shall have the right to conduct the action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) When a person brings an action under this subsection, no person other than the Government may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Rights of the Parties to Qui Tam Actions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Government proceeds with the action, it shall have the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, and shall not be bound by an act of the person bringing the action. Such person shall have the right to continue as a party to the action, subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Government may dismiss the action notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action if the person has been notified by the Government of the filing of the motion and the court has provided the person with an opportunity for a hearing on the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Government may settle the action with the defendant notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action if the court determines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable under all the circumstances. Upon a showing of good cause, such hearing may be held in camera.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Upon a showing by the Government that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would interfere with or unduly delay the Government's prosecution of the case, or would be repetitious, irrelevant, or for purposes of harassment, the court may, in its discretion, impose limitations on the person's participation, such as&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:204 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) limiting the number of witnesses the person may call;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) limiting the length of the testimony of such witnesses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) limiting the person's cross-examination of witnesses; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) otherwise limiting the participation by the person in the litigation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Upon a showing by the defendant that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would be for purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense, the court may limit the participation by the person in the litigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Government elects not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action shall have the right to conduct the action. If the Government so requests, it shall be served with copies of all pleadings filed in the action and shall be supplied with copies of all deposition transcripts (at the Government's expense). When a person proceeds with the action, the court, without limiting the status and rights of the person initiating the action, may nevertheless permit the Government to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Whether or not the Government proceeds with the action, upon a showing by the Government that certain actions of discovery by the person initiating the action would interfere with the Government's investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts, the court may stay such discovery for a period of not more than 60 days. Such a showing shall be conducted in camera. The court may extend the 60-day period upon a further showing in camera that the Government has pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the civil action will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the Government may elect to pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to the Government, including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil money penalty. If any such alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding, the person initiating the action shall have the same rights in such proceeding as such person would have had if the action had continued under this section. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court of the United States, if all time for filing such an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Award to Qui Tam Plaintiff</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Government proceeds with an action brought by a person under subsection (b), such person shall, subject to the second sentence of this paragraph, receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, depending upon the extent to which the person substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action. Where the action is one which the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information (other than information provided by the person bringing the action) relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3730_1_target" name="3730_1">1</a></sup> Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation. Any payment to a person under the first or second sentence of this paragraph shall be made from the proceeds. Any such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Government does not proceed with an action under this section, the person bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. The amount shall be not less than 25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of such proceeds. Such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whether or not the Government proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a person who planned and initiated the violation of section 3729 upon which the action was brought, then the court may, to the extent the court considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action which the person would otherwise receive under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, taking into account the role of that person in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation. If the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of section 3729, that person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action. Such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the United States to continue the action, represented by the Department of Justice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Government does not proceed with the action and the person bringing the action conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim of the person bringing the action was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Certain Actions Barred</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought by a former or present member of the armed <!-- PDFPage:205 -->forces under subsection (b) of this section against a member of the armed forces arising out of such person's service in the armed forces.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought under subsection (b) against a Member of Congress, a member of the judiciary, or a senior executive branch official if the action is based on evidence or information known to the Government when the action was brought.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, &ldquo;senior executive branch official&rdquo; means any officer or employee listed in paragraphs (1) through (8) of section 101(f) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In no event may a person bring an action under subsection (b) which is based upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding in which the Government is already a party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3730_2_target" name="3730_2">2</a></sup> Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, &ldquo;original source&rdquo; means an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the Government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Government Not Liable for Certain Expenses</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Government is not liable for expenses which a person incurs in bringing an action under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Fees and Expenses to Prevailing Defendant</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In civil actions brought under this section by the United States, the provisions of section 2412(d) of title 28 shall apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Any employee who is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment by his or her employer because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others in furtherance of an action under this section, including investigation for, initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this section, shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole. Such relief shall include reinstatement with the same seniority status such employee would have had but for the discrimination, 2 times the amount of back pay, interest on the back pay, and compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees. An employee may bring an action in the appropriate district court of the United States for the relief provided in this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Issuance and service</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever the Attorney General has reason to believe that any person may be in possession, custody, or control of any documentary material or information relevant to a false claims law investigation, the Attorney General may, before commencing a civil proceeding under section 3730 or other false claims law, issue in writing and cause to be served upon such person, a civil investigative demand requiring such person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to produce such documentary material for inspection and copying,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to answer in writing written interrogatories with respect to such documentary material or information,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to give oral testimony concerning such documentary material or information, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to furnish any combination of such material, answers, or testimony.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Attorney General may not delegate the authority to issue civil investigative demands under this subsection. Whenever a civil investigative demand is an express demand for any product of discovery, the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, or an Assistant Attorney General shall cause to be served, in any manner authorized by this section, a copy of such demand upon the person from whom the discovery was obtained and shall notify the person to whom such demand is issued of the date on which such copy was served.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Contents and deadlines.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Each civil investigative demand issued under paragraph (1) shall state the nature of the conduct constituting the alleged violation of a false claims law which is under investigation, and the applicable provision of law alleged to be violated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) If such demand is for the production of documentary material, the demand shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) describe each class of documentary material to be produced with such definiteness and certainty as to permit such material to be fairly identified;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) prescribe a return date for each such class which will provide a reasonable period of time within which the material so demanded may be assembled and made available for inspection and copying; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) identify the false claims law investigator to whom such material shall be made available.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) If such demand is for answers to written interrogatories, the demand shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) set forth with specificity the written interrogatories to be answered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) prescribe dates at which time answers to written interrogatories shall be submitted; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) identify the false claims law investigator to whom such answers shall be submitted.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) If such demand is for the giving of oral testimony, the demand shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) prescribe a date, time, and place at which oral testimony shall be commenced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) identify a false claims law investigator who shall conduct the examination and the custodian to whom the transcript of such examination shall be submitted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) specify that such attendance and testimony are necessary to the conduct of the investigation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) notify the person receiving the demand of the right to be accompanied by an attorney and any other representative; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) describe the general purpose for which the demand is being issued and the general nature of the testimony, including the primary areas of inquiry, which will be taken pursuant to the demand.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Any civil investigative demand issued under this section which is an express demand for any product of discovery shall not be returned or returnable until 20 days after a copy of such demand has been served upon the person from whom the discovery was obtained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) The date prescribed for the commencement of oral testimony pursuant to a civil investigative demand issued under this section shall be a date which is not less than seven days after the date on which demand is received, unless the Attorney General or an Assistant Attorney General designated by the Attorney General determines that exceptional circumstances are present which warrant the commencement of such testimony within a lesser period of time.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:208 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) The Attorney General shall not authorize the issuance under this section of more than one civil investigative demand for oral testimony by the same person unless the person requests otherwise or unless the Attorney General, after investigation, notifies that person in writing that an additional demand for oral testimony is necessary. The Attorney General may not, notwithstanding section 510 of title 28, authorize the performance, by any other officer, employee, or agency, of any function vested in the Attorney General under this subparagraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Protected Material or Information.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A civil investigative demand issued under subsection (a) may not require the production of any documentary material, the submission of any answers to written interrogatories, or the giving of any oral testimony if such material, answers, or testimony would be protected from disclosure under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the standards applicable to subpoenas or subpoenas duces tecum issued by a court of the United States to aid in a grand jury investigation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the standards applicable to discovery requests under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to the extent that the application of such standards to any such demand is appropriate and consistent with the provisions and purposes of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Effect on other orders, rules, and laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any such demand which is an express demand for any product of discovery supersedes any inconsistent order, rule, or provision of law (other than this section) preventing or restraining disclosure of such product of discovery to any person. Disclosure of any product of discovery pursuant to any such express demand does not constitute a waiver of any right or privilege which the person making such disclosure may be entitled to invoke to resist discovery of trial preparation materials.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Service; Jurisdiction.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>By whom served</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any civil investigative demand issued under subsection (a) may be served by a false claims law investigator, or by a United States marshal or a deputy marshal, at any place within the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Service in foreign countries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any such demand or any petition filed under subsection (j) may be served upon any person who is not found within the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States in such manner as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure prescribe for service in a foreign country. To the extent that the courts of the United States can assert jurisdiction over any such person consistent with due process, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have the same jurisdiction to take any action respecting compliance with this section by any such person that such court would have if such person were personally within the jurisdiction of such court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Service Upon Legal Entities and Natural Persons.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Legal entities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Service of any civil investigative demand issued under subsection (a) or of any petition filed under subsection (j) may be made upon a partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity by&mdash;</p>

In the case of service by registered or certified mail, such return shall be accompanied by the return post office receipt of delivery of such demand.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Documentary Material.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Sworn certificates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The production of documentary material in response to a civil investigative demand served under this section shall be made under a sworn certificate, in such form as the demand designates, by&mdash;</p>
