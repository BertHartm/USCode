<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3716. Administrative offset</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) After trying to collect a claim from a person under section 3711(a) of this title, the head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency may collect the claim by administrative offset. The head of the agency may collect by administrative offset only after giving the debtor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) written notice of the type and amount of the claim, the intention of the head of the agency to collect the claim by administrative offset, and an explanation of the rights of the debtor under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an opportunity to inspect and copy the records of the agency related to the claim;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an opportunity for a review within the agency of the decision of the agency related to the claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) an opportunity to make a written agreement with the head of the agency to repay the amount of the claim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Before collecting a claim by administrative offset, the head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency must either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) adopt, without change, regulations on collecting by administrative offset promulgated by the Department of Justice, the General Accounting Office, or the Department of the Treasury; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) prescribe regulations on collecting by administrative offset consistent with the regulations referred to in paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1)(A) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a disbursing official of the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Defense, the United States Postal Service, or any other government corporation, or any disbursing official of the United States designated by the Secretary of the Treasury, shall offset at least annually the amount of a payment which a payment certifying agency has certified to the disbursing official for disbursement, by an amount equal to the amount of a claim which a creditor agency has certified to the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An agency that designates disbursing officials pursuant to section 3321(c) of this title is not required to certify claims arising out of its operations to the Secretary of the Treasury before such agency's disbursing officials offset such claims.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Payments certified by the Department of Education under a program administered by the Secretary of Education under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 shall not be subject to administrative offset under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Neither the disbursing official nor the payment certifying agency shall be liable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for the amount of the administrative offset on the basis that the underlying obligation, represented by the payment before the administrative offset was taken, was not satisfied; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for failure to provide timely notice under paragraph (8).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law (including sections 207 and 1631(d)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 407 and 1383(d)(1)), section 413(b) of Public Law 91&ndash;173 (30 U.S.C. 923(b)), and section 14 of the Act of August 29, 1935 (45 U.S.C. 231m)), except as provided in clause (ii), all payments due to an individual under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the Social Security Act,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) any law administered by the Railroad Retirement Board (other than payments that such Board determines to be tier 2 benefits),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be subject to offset under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) An amount of $9,000 which a debtor may receive under Federal benefit programs cited under clause (i) within a 12-month period shall be exempt from offset under this subsection. In applying the $9,000 exemption, the disbursing official shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) reduce the $9,000 exemption amount for the 12-month period by the amount of all Federal benefit payments made during such 12-month period which are not subject to offset under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) apply a prorated amount of the exemption to each periodic benefit payment to be made to the debtor during the applicable 12-month period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the amount of a periodic benefit payment shall be the amount after any reduction or deduction required under the laws authorizing the program under which such payment is authorized to be made (including any reduction or deduction to recover any overpayment under such program).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary of the Treasury shall exempt from administrative offset under this subsection payments under means-tested programs when requested by the head of the respective agency. The Secretary may exempt other payments from administrative offset under this subsection upon the written request of the head of a payment certifying agency. A written request for exemption of other payments must provide justification for the exemption under standards prescribed by the Secretary. Such standards shall give due consideration to whether administrative offset would tend to interfere substantially with or defeat the purposes of the payment certifying agency's program. The Secretary shall report to the Congress annually on exemptions granted under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The provisions of sections 205(b)(1), 809(a)(1), and 1631(c)(1) of the Social Security Act shall not apply to any administrative offset executed pursuant to this section against benefits authorized by title II, VIII, or title XVI of the Social Security Act, respectively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of the Treasury may charge a fee sufficient to cover the full cost of implementing this subsection. The fee may be collected either by the retention of a portion of amounts collected pursuant to this subsection, or by billing the agency referring or transferring a claim for those amounts. Fees charged to the agencies shall be based on actual administrative offsets completed. Amounts received by the United States as fees under this subsection shall be deposited into the account of the Department of the Treasury under section 3711(g)(7) of this title, and shall be collected and accounted for in accordance with the provisions of that section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Commissioner of Social Security <!-- PDFPage:207 -->and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, may prescribe such rules, regulations, and procedures as the Secretary of the Treasury considers necessary to carry out this subsection. The Secretary shall consult with the heads of affected agencies in the development of such rules, regulations, and procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any Federal agency that is owed by a person a past due, legally enforceable nontax debt that is over 180 days delinquent, including nontax debt administered by a third party acting as an agent for the Federal Government, shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of all such nontax debts for purposes of administrative offset under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) The disbursing official conducting an administrative offset with respect to a payment to a payee shall notify the payee in writing of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the occurrence of the administrative offset to satisfy a past due legally enforceable debt, including a description of the type and amount of the payment otherwise payable to the payee against which the offset was executed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the identity of the creditor agency requesting the offset; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) a contact point within the creditor agency that will handle concerns regarding the offset.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the payment to be offset is a periodic benefit payment, the disbursing official shall take reasonable steps, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, to provide the notice to the payee not later than the date on which the payee is otherwise scheduled to receive the payment, or as soon as practical thereafter, but no later than the date of the administrative offset. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the failure of the debtor to receive such notice shall not impair the legality of such administrative offset.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall take precedence over requests for administrative offset pursuant to other laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the use of any other administrative offset authority existing under statute or common law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) This section does not apply&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to a claim under this subchapter that has been outstanding for more than 10 years; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) when a statute explicitly prohibits using administrative offset or setoff to collect the claim or type of claim involved.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary may waive the requirements of sections 552a(<em>o</em>) and (p) of title 5 for administrative offset or claims collection upon written certification by the head of a State or an executive, judicial, or legislative agency seeking to collect the claim that the requirements of subsection (a) of this section have been met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Data Integrity Board of the Department of the Treasury established under 552a(u) of title 5 shall review and include in reports under paragraph (3)(D) of that section a description of any matching activities conducted under this section. If the Secretary has granted a waiver under subsection (f) of this section, no other Data Integrity Board is required to take any action under section 552a(u) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) The Secretary may, in the discretion of the Secretary, apply subsection (a) with respect to any past-due, legally-enforceable debt owed to a State if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the appropriate State disbursing official requests that an offset be performed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a reciprocal agreement with the State is in effect which contains, at a minimum&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) requirements substantially equivalent to subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) any other requirements which the Secretary considers appropriate to facilitate the offset and prevent duplicative efforts.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This subsection does not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the collection of a debt or claim on which the administrative costs associated with the collection of the debt or claim exceed the amount of the debt or claim;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any collection of any other type, class, or amount of claim, as the Secretary considers necessary to protect the interest of the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the disbursement of any class or type of payment exempted by the Secretary of the Treasury at the request of a Federal agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In applying this section with respect to any debt owed to a State, subsection (c)(3)(A) shall not apply.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13019, Sept. 28, 1996, 61 F.R. 51763, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, Public Law 104&ndash;134 [&sect;31001] (110 Stat. 1321&ndash;358 <em>et seq</em>.) [see Short Title of 1996 Amendment note set out under section 3701 of this title], was enacted into law on April 26, 1996, as part of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996. While the primary purpose of the Debt Collection Improvement Act is to increase the collection of nontax debts owed to the Federal Government, the Act also contains important provisions that can be used to assist families in collecting past-due child support obligations.</p>
<p class="note-body">The failure of some parents to meet their child support obligations threatens the health, education, and well-being of their children. Compounding this problem, States have experienced difficulties enforcing child support obligations once a parent has moved to another State. With this Executive order, my Administration takes additional steps to support our children and strengthen American families by facilitating the collection of delinquent child support obligations from persons who may be entitled or eligible to receive certain Federal payments or Federal assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Administrative Offsets</em>. (a)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury (&ldquo;the Secretary&rdquo;), in accordance with the provisions of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 and to the extent permitted by law, and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and other affected agencies, shall promptly develop and implement procedures necessary for the Secretary to collect past-due child support debts by administrative offset, and shall issue such rules, regulations, and procedures as the Secretary, in consultation with the heads of affected agencies, deems appropriate to govern administrative offsets by the Department of the Treasury and other executive departments and agencies that disburse Federal payments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The Secretary may enter into reciprocal agreements with States concerning the collection by the Secretary of delinquent child support debts through administrative offsets.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, within 120 days of the date of this order, implement procedures necessary to report to the Secretary of the Treasury information on past-due child support claims referred by States (including claims enforced by States pursuant to cooperative agreements with or by Indian tribal governments) to the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The head of each executive department and agency that certifies payments to the Secretary or to another disbursing official shall review each class of payments that the department or agency certifies to determine if any such class should be exempt from offset and, if any class is so identified, submit to the Secretary a request for such an exemption together with the reasons therefor. With respect to classes of payments under means-tested programs existing on the date of this order, such submission shall be made within 30 days of the date of this order. With respect to classes of payments other than payments under means-tested programs existing on the date of this order, such submissions shall be made within 30 days of the date the Secretary establishes standards pursuant to section 3716(c)(3) of title 31, United States Code. With respect to a class of payments established after the date of this order, such submissions shall be made not later than 30 days after such class is established.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The head of each executive department and agency that certifies payments to the Secretary shall promptly implement any rule, regulation, or procedure issued by the Secretary pursuant to this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The head of each executive department and agency that is authorized by law to disburse payments shall promptly implement any rule, regulation, or procedure issued by the Secretary pursuant to this section and shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) match, consistent with computer privacy matching laws, the payment certification records of such department or agency with records of persons delinquent in child support payments as directed by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) conduct administrative offsets to collect delinquent child support payments.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:209 --><p class="note-body">(f) The Secretary shall, to the extent permitted by law, share with the Secretary of Health and Human Services any information contained in payment certification records of persons who are delinquent in child support obligations that would assist in the collection of such debts, whether or not an administrative offset is conducted.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Denial of Federal Assistance</em>. (a) The Secretary shall, to the extent permitted by law, ensure that information concerning individuals whose payments are subject to administrative offset because of delinquent child support obligations is made available to the head of each executive department and agency that provides Federal financial assistance to individuals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In conformance with section 2(e) of this order, the head of each executive department and agency shall, with respect to any individuals whose payments are subject to administrative offset because of a delinquent child support obligation, promptly implement procedures to deny Federal financial assistance to such individuals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and other affected agencies, shall promptly issue guidelines for departments and agencies concerning minimum due-process standards to be included in the procedures required by subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) For purposes of this section, Federal financial assistance means any Federal loan (other than a disaster loan), loan guarantee, or loan insurance.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e)(1) A class of Federal financial assistance shall not be subject to denial if the head of the concerned department or agency determines:</p>
<p class="note-body">(A) in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, that such action:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) is not permitted by law; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) would likely result in valid legal claims for damages against the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body">(B) that such action would be inconsistent with the best interests of the child or children with respect to whom a child support obligation is owed; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(C) that such action should be waived.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The head of each executive department and agency shall provide written notification to the Secretary upon determining that the denial of a class of Federal financial assistance is not permitted by law or should be waived.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) The head of each executive department and agency shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) review all laws under the jurisdiction of the department or agency that do not permit the denial of Federal financial assistance to individuals and whose payments are subject to administrative offset because of a delinquent child support obligation and, where appropriate, transmit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget recommendations for statutory changes; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) to the extent practicable, review all rules, regulations, and procedures implementing laws under the jurisdiction of the department or agency governing the provision of any Federal financial assistance to individuals and, where appropriate, conform such rules, regulations, and procedures to the provisions of this order and the rules, regulations, and procedures issued by the Secretary pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Reports</em>. (a) The head of each executive department and agency shall provide to the Secretary such information as the Secretary may request concerning the implementation of this order, the provisions of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 applicable to delinquent child support obligations, and the rules, regulations, and procedures issued by the Secretary pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary shall report annually to the President concerning the implementation by departments and agencies of this order and the provisions of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 applicable to delinquent child support obligations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The rate of interest charged under subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is the rate in effect on the date from which interest begins to accrue under subsection (b) of this section; and</p>

The contract shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the head of the agency retains the authority to resolve a dispute, compromise a claim, end collection action, and refer a matter to the Attorney General to bring a civil action; and</p>

Each such contract shall include such terms and conditions as the Attorney General considers necessary and appropriate, including a provision specifying the amount of the fee to be paid to the private counsel under such contract or the method for calculating that fee. The <!-- PDFPage:211 -->amount of the fee payable for legal services furnished under any such contract may not exceed the fee that counsel engaged in the private practice of law in the area or areas where the legal services are furnished typically charge clients for furnishing legal services in the collection of claims of indebtedness, as determined by the Attorney General, considering the amount, age, and nature of the indebtedness and whether the debtor is an individual or a business entity. Nothing in this subparagraph shall relieve the Attorney General of the competition requirements set forth in title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 and following).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Attorney General shall use his best efforts to enter into contracts under this paragraph with law firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and law firms that are qualified HUBZone small business concerns (as defined in section 3(p) of the Small Business Act), so as to enable each agency to comply with paragraph (3).</p>

For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the term &ldquo;law firm owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals&rdquo; means a law firm that meets the requirements set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of section 8(d)(3)(C) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(3)(C)(i) and (ii)) and regulations issued under those clauses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) &ldquo;socially and economically disadvantaged individuals&rdquo; shall be presumed to include these groups and individuals described in the last paragraph of section 8(d)(3)(C) of the Small Business Act; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the term &ldquo;qualified HUBZone small business concern&rdquo; has the meaning given that term in section 3(p) of the Small Business Act.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding sections 516, 518(b), 519, and 547(2) of title 28, a private counsel retained under paragraph (1) of this subsection may represent the United States in litigation in connection with legal services furnished pursuant to the contract entered into with that counsel under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) &ldquo;settle&rdquo; means consider, determine, adjust, and dispose of a claim by disallowance or by complete or partial allowance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The head of an agency may settle and pay not more than $40,000 for a claim against the Government made by a member of the uniformed services under the jurisdiction of the agency or by an officer or employee of the agency for damage to, or loss of, personal property incident to service.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) A claim may be allowed under this section only if it is presented in writing within 2 years after the claim accrues. However, if a claim under subsection (b) of this section accrues during war or an armed conflict in which an armed force of the United States is involved, or has accrued within 2 years before war or an armed conflict begins, and for cause shown, the claim must be presented within 2 years after the cause no longer exists or after the war or armed conflict ends, whichever is earlier.

<p class="statutory-body">(i) Notwithstanding a contract, the representative of a claimant may not receive more than 10 percent of a payment of a claim made under this section for services related to the claim. A person violating this subsection shall be fined not more than $1,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) The President may prescribe policies to carry out this section (except subsection (b) to the extent that subsection (b) applies to the military departments, the Department of Defense, and the Coast Guard). Subject to those policies, the head of each agency shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section, &ldquo;assignment&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a transfer or assignment of any part of a claim against the United States Government or of an interest in the claim; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the authorization to receive payment for any part of the claim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) An assignment may be made only after a claim is allowed, the amount of the claim is decided, and a warrant for payment of the claim has been issued. The assignment shall specify the warrant, must be made freely, and must be attested to by 2 witnesses. The person making the assignment shall acknowledge it before an official who may acknowledge a deed, and the official shall certify the assignment. The certificate shall state that the official completely explained the assignment when it was acknowledged. An assignment under this subsection is valid for any purpose.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:226 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply to an assignment to a financing institution of money due or to become due under a contract providing for payments totaling at least $1,000 when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the contract does not forbid an assignment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) unless the contract expressly provides otherwise, the assignment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is for the entire amount not already paid;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is made to only one party, except that it may be made to a party as agent or trustee for more than one party participating in the financing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may not be reassigned; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the assignee files a written notice of the assignment and a copy of the assignment with the contracting official or the head of the agency, the surety on a bond on the contract, and any disbursing official for the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) During a war or national emergency proclaimed by the President or declared by law and ended by proclamation or law, a contract with the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, the Department of Energy (when carrying out duties and powers formerly carried out by the Atomic Energy Commission), or other agency the President designates may provide, or may be changed without consideration to provide, that a future payment under the contract to an assignee is not subject to reduction or setoff. A payment subsequently due under the contract (even after the war or emergency is ended) shall be paid to the assignee without a reduction or setoff for liability of the assignor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to the Government independent of the contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) because of renegotiation, fine, penalty (except an amount that may be collected or withheld under, or because the assignor does not comply with, the contract), taxes, social security contributions, or withholding or failing to withhold taxes or social security contributions, arising from, or independent of, the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) An assignee under this section does not have to make restitution of, refund, or repay the amount received because of the liability of the assignor to the Government that arises from or is independent of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Government may not collect or reclaim money paid to a person receiving an amount under an assignment or allotment of pay or allowances authorized by law when liability may exist because of the death of the person making the assignment or allotment.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3730. Civil actions for false claims</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Responsibilities of the Attorney General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Attorney General diligently shall investigate a violation under section 3729. If the Attorney General finds that a person has violated or is violating section 3729, the Attorney General may bring a civil action under this section against the person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Actions by Private Persons</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person may bring a civil action for a violation of section 3729 for the person and for the United States Government. The action shall be brought in the name of the Government. The action may be dismissed only if the court and the Attorney General give written consent to the dismissal and their reasons for consenting.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses shall be served on the Government pursuant to Rule 4(d)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The complaint shall be filed in camera, shall remain under seal for at least 60 days, and shall not be served on the defendant until the court so orders. The Government may elect to intervene and proceed with the action within 60 days after it receives both the complaint and the material evidence and information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Government may, for good cause shown, move the court for extensions of the time during which the complaint remains under seal under paragraph (2). Any such motions may be supported by affidavits or other submissions in camera. The defendant shall not be required to respond to any complaint filed under this section until 20 days after the complaint is unsealed and served upon the defendant pursuant to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Before the expiration of the 60-day period or any extensions obtained under paragraph (3), the Government shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) proceed with the action, in which case the action shall be conducted by the Government; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) notify the court that it declines to take over the action, in which case the person bringing the action shall have the right to conduct the action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) When a person brings an action under this subsection, no person other than the Government may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Rights of the Parties to Qui Tam Actions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Government proceeds with the action, it shall have the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, and shall not be bound by an act of the person bringing the action. Such person shall have the right to continue as a party to the action, subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Government may dismiss the action notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action if the person has been notified by the Government of the filing of the motion and the court has provided the person with an opportunity for a hearing on the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Government may settle the action with the defendant notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action if the court determines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable under all the circumstances. Upon a showing of good cause, such hearing may be held in camera.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Upon a showing by the Government that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would interfere with or unduly delay the Government's prosecution of the case, or would be repetitious, irrelevant, or for purposes of harassment, the court may, in its discretion, impose limitations on the person's participation, such as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) limiting the number of witnesses the person may call;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) limiting the length of the testimony of such witnesses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) limiting the person's cross-examination of witnesses; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) otherwise limiting the participation by the person in the litigation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Upon a showing by the defendant that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would be for purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense, the court may limit the participation by the person in the litigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Government elects not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action shall have the right to conduct the action. If the Government so requests, it shall be served with copies of all pleadings filed in the action and shall be supplied with copies of all deposition transcripts (at the Government's expense). When a person proceeds with the action, the court, without limiting the status and rights of the person initiating the action, may nevertheless permit the Government to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Whether or not the Government proceeds with the action, upon a showing by the Government that certain actions of discovery by the person initiating the action would interfere with the Government's investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts, the court may stay such discovery for a period of not more than 60 days. Such a showing shall be conducted in camera. The court may extend the 60-day period upon a further showing in camera that the Government has pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the civil action will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:230 --><p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the Government may elect to pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to the Government, including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil money penalty. If any such alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding, the person initiating the action shall have the same rights in such proceeding as such person would have had if the action had continued under this section. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court of the United States, if all time for filing such an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Award to Qui Tam Plaintiff</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Government proceeds with an action brought by a person under subsection (b), such person shall, subject to the second sentence of this paragraph, receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, depending upon the extent to which the person substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action. Where the action is one which the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information (other than information provided by the person bringing the action) relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3730_1_target" name="3730_1">1</a></sup> Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation. Any payment to a person under the first or second sentence of this paragraph shall be made from the proceeds. Any such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Government does not proceed with an action under this section, the person bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. The amount shall be not less than 25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of such proceeds. Such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whether or not the Government proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a person who planned and initiated the violation of section 3729 upon which the action was brought, then the court may, to the extent the court considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action which the person would otherwise receive under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, taking into account the role of that person in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation. If the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of section 3729, that person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action. Such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the United States to continue the action, represented by the Department of Justice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Government does not proceed with the action and the person bringing the action conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim of the person bringing the action was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Certain Actions Barred</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought by a former or present member of the armed forces under subsection (b) of this section against a member of the armed forces arising out of such person's service in the armed forces.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought under subsection (b) against a Member of Congress, a member of the judiciary, or a senior executive branch official if the action is based on evidence or information known to the Government when the action was brought.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, &ldquo;senior executive branch official&rdquo; means any officer or employee listed in paragraphs (1) through (8) of section 101(f) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In no event may a person bring an action under subsection (b) which is based upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding in which the Government is already a party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3730_2_target" name="3730_2">2</a></sup> Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, &ldquo;original source&rdquo; means an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the Government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Government Not Liable for Certain Expenses</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Government is not liable for expenses which a person incurs in bringing an action under this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:231 --><p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Fees and Expenses to Prevailing Defendant</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In civil actions brought under this section by the United States, the provisions of section 2412(d) of title 28 shall apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Any employee who is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment by his or her employer because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others in furtherance of an action under this section, including investigation for, initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this section, shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole. Such relief shall include reinstatement with the same seniority status such employee would have had but for the discrimination, 2 times the amount of back pay, interest on the back pay, and compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees. An employee may bring an action in the appropriate district court of the United States for the relief provided in this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<!-- PDFPage:233 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Issuance and service</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever the Attorney General has reason to believe that any person may be in possession, custody, or control of any documentary material or information relevant to a false claims law investigation, the Attorney General may, before commencing a civil proceeding under section 3730 or other false claims law, issue in writing and cause to be served upon such person, a civil investigative demand requiring such person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to produce such documentary material for inspection and copying,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to answer in writing written interrogatories with respect to such documentary material or information,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to give oral testimony concerning such documentary material or information, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to furnish any combination of such material, answers, or testimony.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Attorney General may not delegate the authority to issue civil investigative demands under this subsection. Whenever a civil investigative demand is an express demand for any product of discovery, the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, or an Assistant Attorney General shall cause to be served, in any manner authorized by this section, a copy of such demand upon the person from whom the discovery was obtained and shall notify the person to whom such demand is issued of the date on which such copy was served.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Contents and deadlines.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Each civil investigative demand issued under paragraph (1) shall state the nature of the conduct constituting the alleged violation of a false claims law which is under investigation, and the applicable provision of law alleged to be violated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) If such demand is for the production of documentary material, the demand shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) describe each class of documentary material to be produced with such definiteness and certainty as to permit such material to be fairly identified;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) prescribe a return date for each such class which will provide a reasonable period of time within which the material so demanded may be assembled and made available for inspection and copying; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) identify the false claims law investigator to whom such material shall be made available.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) If such demand is for answers to written interrogatories, the demand shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) set forth with specificity the written interrogatories to be answered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) prescribe dates at which time answers to written interrogatories shall be submitted; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) identify the false claims law investigator to whom such answers shall be submitted.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) If such demand is for the giving of oral testimony, the demand shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) prescribe a date, time, and place at which oral testimony shall be commenced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) identify a false claims law investigator who shall conduct the examination and the custodian to whom the transcript of such examination shall be submitted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) specify that such attendance and testimony are necessary to the conduct of the investigation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) notify the person receiving the demand of the right to be accompanied by an attorney and any other representative; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) describe the general purpose for which the demand is being issued and the general nature of the testimony, including the primary areas of inquiry, which will be taken pursuant to the demand.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Any civil investigative demand issued under this section which is an express demand for any product of discovery shall not be returned or returnable until 20 days after a copy of such demand has been served upon the person from whom the discovery was obtained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) The date prescribed for the commencement of oral testimony pursuant to a civil investigative demand issued under this section shall be a date which is not less than seven days after the date on which demand is received, unless the Attorney General or an Assistant Attorney General designated by the Attorney General determines that exceptional circumstances are present which warrant the commencement of such testimony within a lesser period of time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) The Attorney General shall not authorize the issuance under this section of more than one civil investigative demand for oral testimony by the same person unless the person requests otherwise or unless the Attorney General, after investigation, notifies that person in writing that an additional demand for oral testimony is necessary. The Attorney General may not, notwithstanding section 510 of title 28, authorize the performance, by any other officer, employee, or agency, of any function vested in the Attorney General under this subparagraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Protected Material or Information.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A civil investigative demand issued under subsection (a) may not require the production of any documentary material, the submission of any answers to written interrogatories, or the giving of any oral testimony if such material, answers, or testimony would be protected from disclosure under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the standards applicable to subpoenas or subpoenas duces tecum issued by a court of the United States to aid in a grand jury investigation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the standards applicable to discovery requests under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to the extent that the application of such standards to any such demand is appropriate and consistent with the provisions and purposes of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Effect on other orders, rules, and laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any such demand which is an express demand for any product of discovery supersedes any inconsistent order, rule, or provision of law (other than this section) preventing or restraining disclosure of such product of discovery to any person. Disclosure of any product of discovery pursuant to any such express demand does not constitute a waiver of any <!-- PDFPage:234 -->right or privilege which the person making such disclosure may be entitled to invoke to resist discovery of trial preparation materials.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Service; Jurisdiction.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>By whom served</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any civil investigative demand issued under subsection (a) may be served by a false claims law investigator, or by a United States marshal or a deputy marshal, at any place within the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Service in foreign countries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any such demand or any petition filed under subsection (j) may be served upon any person who is not found within the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States in such manner as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure prescribe for service in a foreign country. To the extent that the courts of the United States can assert jurisdiction over any such person consistent with due process, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have the same jurisdiction to take any action respecting compliance with this section by any such person that such court would have if such person were personally within the jurisdiction of such court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Service Upon Legal Entities and Natural Persons.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Legal entities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Service of any civil investigative demand issued under subsection (a) or of any petition filed under subsection (j) may be made upon a partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) delivering an executed copy of such demand or petition to any partner, executive officer, managing agent, or general agent of the partnership, corporation, association, or entity, or to any agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process on behalf of such partnership, corporation, association, or entity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) delivering an executed copy of such demand or petition to the principal office or place of business of the partnership, corporation, association, or entity; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) depositing an executed copy of such demand or petition in the United States mails by registered or certified mail, with a return receipt requested, addressed to such partnership, corporation, association, or entity at its principal office or place of business.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Natural persons</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Service of any such demand or petition may be made upon any natural person by&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Proof of Service</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A verified return by the individual serving any civil investigative demand issued under subsection (a) or any petition filed under subsection (j) setting forth the manner of such service shall be proof of such service. In the case of service by registered or certified mail, such return shall be accompanied by the return post office receipt of delivery of such demand.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Documentary Material.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Sworn certificates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The production of documentary material in response to a civil investigative demand served under this section shall be made under a sworn certificate, in such form as the demand designates, by&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The certificate shall state that all of the documentary material required by the demand and in the possession, custody, or control of the person to whom the demand is directed has been produced and made available to the false claims law investigator identified in the demand.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Production of materials</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any person upon whom any civil investigative demand for the production of documentary material has been served under this section shall make such material available for inspection and copying to the false claims law investigator identified in such demand at the principal place of business of such person, or at such other place as the false claims law investigator and the person thereafter may agree and prescribe in writing, or as the court may direct under subsection (j)(1). Such material shall be made so available on the return date specified in such demand, or on such later date as the false claims law investigator may prescribe in writing. Such person may, upon written agreement between the person and the false claims law investigator, substitute copies for originals of all or any part of such material.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Interrogatories</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each interrogatory in a civil investigative demand served under this section shall be answered separately and fully in writing under oath and shall be submitted under a sworn certificate, in such form as the demand designates, by&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of a person other than a natural person, the person or persons responsible for answering each interrogatory.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If any interrogatory is objected to, the reasons for the objection shall be stated in the certificate instead of an answer. The certificate shall state that all information required by the demand and in the possession, custody, control, or knowledge of the person to whom the demand is directed has been submitted. To the extent that any information is not furnished, the information shall be identified and reasons set forth with particularity regarding the reasons why the information was not furnished.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Oral Examinations.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The examination of any person pursuant to a civil investigative demand for oral testimony served under this section shall be taken before an officer authorized to administer oaths and affirmations by the laws of the United States or of the place <!-- PDFPage:235 -->where the examination is held. The officer before whom the testimony is to be taken shall put the witness on oath or affirmation and shall, personally or by someone acting under the direction of the officer and in the officer's presence, record the testimony of the witness. The testimony shall be taken stenographically and shall be transcribed. When the testimony is fully transcribed, the officer before whom the testimony is taken shall promptly transmit a copy of the transcript of the testimony to the custodian. This subsection shall not preclude the taking of testimony by any means authorized by, and in a manner consistent with, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Persons present</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The false claims law investigator conducting the examination shall exclude from the place where the examination is held all persons except the person giving the testimony, the attorney for and any other representative of the person giving the testimony, the attorney for the Government, any person who may be agreed upon by the attorney for the Government and the person giving the testimony, the officer before whom the testimony is to be taken, and any stenographer taking such testimony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Where testimony taken</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The oral testimony of any person taken pursuant to a civil investigative demand served under this section shall be taken in the judicial district of the United States within which such person resides, is found, or transacts business, or in such other place as may be agreed upon by the false claims law investigator conducting the examination and such person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Transcript of testimony</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the testimony is fully transcribed, the false claims law investigator or the officer before whom the testimony is taken shall afford the witness, who may be accompanied by counsel, a reasonable opportunity to examine and read the transcript, unless such examination and reading are waived by the witness. Any changes in form or substance which the witness desires to make shall be entered and identified upon the transcript by the officer or the false claims law investigator, with a statement of the reasons given by the witness for making such changes. The transcript shall then be signed by the witness, unless the witness in writing waives the signing, is ill, cannot be found, or refuses to sign. If the transcript is not signed by the witness within 30 days after being afforded a reasonable opportunity to examine it, the officer or the false claims law investigator shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver, illness, absence of the witness, or the refusal to sign, together with the reasons, if any, given therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Certification and delivery to custodian</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The officer before whom the testimony is taken shall certify on the transcript that the witness was sworn by the officer and that the transcript is a true record of the testimony given by the witness, and the officer or false claims law investigator shall promptly deliver the transcript, or send the transcript by registered or certified mail, to the custodian.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <cap-smallcap>Furnishing or inspection of transcript by witness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon payment of reasonable charges therefor, the false claims law investigator shall furnish a copy of the transcript to the witness only, except that the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, or an Assistant Attorney General may, for good cause, limit such witness to inspection of the official transcript of the witness&rsquo; testimony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) <cap-smallcap>Conduct of oral testimony</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) Any person compelled to appear for oral testimony under a civil investigative demand issued under subsection (a) may be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel. Counsel may advise such person, in confidence, with respect to any question asked of such person. Such person or counsel may object on the record to any question, in whole or in part, and shall briefly state for the record the reason for the objection. An objection may be made, received, and entered upon the record when it is claimed that such person is entitled to refuse to answer the question on the grounds of any constitutional or other legal right or privilege, including the privilege against self-incrimination. Such person may not otherwise object to or refuse to answer any question, and may not directly or through counsel otherwise interrupt the oral examination. If such person refuses to answer any question, a petition may be filed in the district court of the United States under subsection (j)(1) for an order compelling such person to answer such question.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If such person refuses to answer any question on the grounds of the privilege against self-incrimination, the testimony of such person may be compelled in accordance with the provisions of part V of title 18.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) <cap-smallcap>Witness fees and allowances</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any person appearing for oral testimony under a civil investigative demand issued under subsection (a) shall be entitled to the same fees and allowances which are paid to witnesses in the district courts of the United States.</p>
