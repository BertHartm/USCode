<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary of State may settle, for not more than $1,500 in any one case, a claim for personal injury or death of an individual not a national of the United States in a foreign country in which the United States exercises privileges of extraterritoriality when the injury or death is caused by an officer, employee, or agent of the United States Government (except of a military department of the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard). An officer or employee of the Government may not present a claim. A claim under this section may be allowed only if it is presented to the Secretary within one year after it accrues.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary shall certify to Congress a settlement under this section for payment out of an appropriation that may be made to pay the settlement. The Secretary shall include a brief statement on the type of the claim, the amount claimed, and the amount of the settlement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A claim may be paid under this section only if the claimant accepts the amount of the settlement in complete satisfaction of the claim against the Government.</p>
