<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;In addition to the bonds and notes authorized by sections <!-- PDFPage:132 -->752, 753, and 757c of this title&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;subject to the limitation imposed by section 757b of this title&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;for expenditures authorized by law&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;for the purposes of this Act .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and to meet public expenditures authorized by law&rdquo; for clarity and because they are inclusive. The words &ldquo;under section 3111 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;at or before maturity, of any outstanding bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness or Treasury bills of the United States&rdquo; because of the restatement. The words &ldquo;at not less than par&rdquo; are omitted as superseded by section 3 of the Public Debt Act of 1942 (ch. 205, 56 Stat. 189), restated in section 3121 of the revised title. The text of 31:754(a)(2d sentence) is omitted as superseded by section 3121(a) of the revised title. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;and at such rate or rates of interest, payable at such time or times as he may prescribe&rdquo; are omitted because they are superseded by section 3121(a), (b)(1), and (c) of the revised title. In clause (2), the words &ldquo;on a discount basis and payable at maturity without interest&rdquo; are omitted because they are superseded by section 3121(a) of the revised title. The words &ldquo;of the Government&rdquo; are added for consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;terms and&rdquo; after &ldquo;upon such&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;for issuing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. under section 3121 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;subject to such terms and conditions&rdquo; because of the restatement. The words &ldquo;Notwithstanding section 3121(a)(5) of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall be payable at such time&rdquo; for clarity because the section cited contains the general authority to which subsection (c)(last sentence) of this section is an exception.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;account of&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
