<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall not be required to reissue United States currency notes upon redemption.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) outstanding currency referred to in subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Secretary makes a determination under this subsection, the Secretary shall reduce the amount of that currency outstanding by the amount the Secretary determines will not be redeemed and credit the appropriate receipt account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) To provide a historical collection of United States currency, the Secretary may withhold from cancellation and destruction and transfer to a special account one piece of each design, issue, or series of each denomination of each kind of currency (including circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) after redemption. The Secretary may make appropriate entries in Treasury accounts because of the transfers.</p>
