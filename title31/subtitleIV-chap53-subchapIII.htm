<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Money laundering and related financial crimes frequently appear to be concentrated in particular geographic areas, financial systems, industry sectors, or financial institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) While the Secretary has the responsibility to act with regard to Federal offenses which are being committed in a particular locality or are directed at a single institution, because modern financial systems and institutions are interconnected to a degree which was not possible until recently, money laundering and other related financial crimes are likely to have local, State, national, and international effects wherever they are committed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Purpose and objective</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the purpose of this section to provide a mechanism for designating any area where money laundering or a related financial crime appears to be occurring at a higher than average rate such that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Specific initiatives</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any head of a department, bureau, or law enforcement agency, including any State or local prosecutor, involved in the detection, prevention, and suppression of money laundering and related financial crimes and any State or local official or prosecutor may submit&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The number of bank and nonbank financial institution transactions which originate in such area or involve institutions located in such area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The number of stock or commodities transactions which originate in such area or involve institutions located in such area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Whether the area is a key transportation hub with any international ports or airports or an extensive highway system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Whether the area is an international center for banking or commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The extent to which financial crimes and financial crime-related activities in such area are having a harmful impact in other areas of the country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The number or nature of requests for information or analytical assistance which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are made to the analytical component of the Department of the Treasury; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) The extent to which State and local governments and State and local law enforcement agencies have committed resources to respond to the financial crime problem in the area and the degree to which the commitment of such resources reflects a determination by such government and agencies to address the problem aggressively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) The extent to which a significant increase in the allocation of Federal resources to combat financial crimes in such area is necessary to provide an adequate State and local response to financial crimes and financial crime-related activities in such area.</p>
