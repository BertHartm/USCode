<p class="note-body">In the section, before clause (1), the words &ldquo;for a project to be financed by at least 2 assistance programs&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;under two or more Federal programs in support of any project&rdquo; for consistency in the revised chapter. The words &ldquo;shall take action&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Actions taken by Federal agency heads pursuant to this chapter that relate to&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;that will ensure&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall be designed to assure&rdquo;, to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;so far as reasonably possible&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In clause (4), the word &ldquo;impediments&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. The word &ldquo;providing&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;Federal provision of&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;joint assistance under the application&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;on a joint basis&rdquo;, to eliminate unnecessary words. Clause (5) is substituted for 42:4253(5) because of the restatement.</p>
