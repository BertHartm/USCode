<h4 class="note-head">Improvement of International Standards and Cooperation To Fight Terrorist Financing</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;458, title VII, &sect;&sect;7701, 7702, 7704, Dec. 17, 2004, 118 Stat. 3858&ndash;3860, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 7701. IMPROVING INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND COOPERATION TO FIGHT TERRORIST FINANCING.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The global war on terrorism and cutting off terrorist financing is a policy priority for the United States and its partners, working bilaterally and multilaterally through the United Nations, the United Nations Security Council and its committees, such as the 1267 and 1373 Committees, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), and various international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), and the regional multilateral development banks, and other multilateral fora.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The international financial community has become engaged in the global fight against terrorist financing. The Financial Action Task Force has focused on the new threat posed by terrorist financing to the international financial system, resulting in the establishment of the FATF's Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing as the international standard on combating terrorist financing. The Group of Seven and the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers are developing action plans to curb the financing of terror. In addition, other economic and regional fora, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum, and the Western Hemisphere Financial Ministers, have been used to marshal political will and actions in support of combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) standards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) FATF's Forty Recommendations on Money Laundering and the Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing are the recognized global standards for fighting money laundering and terrorist financing. The FATF has engaged in an assessment process for jurisdictions based on their compliance with these standards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) In March 2004, the IMF and IBRD Boards agreed to make permanent a pilot program of collaboration with the FATF to assess global compliance with the FATF Forty Recommendations on Money Laundering and the Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing. As a result, anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) assessments are now a regular part of their Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Offshore Financial Center assessments, which provide for a comprehensive analysis of the strength of a jurisdiction's financial system. These reviews assess potential systemic vulnerabilities, consider sectoral development needs and priorities, and review the state of implementation of and compliance with key financial codes and regulatory standards, among them the AML and CFT standards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) To date, 70 FSAPs have been conducted, with over 24 of those incorporating AML and CFT assessments. The international financial institutions (IFIs), the FATF, and the FATF-style regional bodies together are expected to assess AML and CFT regimes in up to 40 countries or jurisdictions per year. This will help countries and jurisdictions identify deficiencies in their AML and CFT regimes and help focus technical assistance efforts.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:342 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Technical assistance programs from the United States and other nations, coordinated with the Department of State and other departments and agencies, are playing an important role in helping countries and jurisdictions address shortcomings in their AML and CFT regimes and bringing their regimes into conformity with international standards. Training is coordinated within the United States Government, which leverages multilateral organizations and bodies and international financial institutions to internationalize the conveyance of technical assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) In fulfilling its duties in advancing incorporation of AML and CFT standards into the IFIs as part of the IFIs&rsquo; work on protecting the integrity of the international monetary system, the Department of the Treasury, under the guidance of the Secretary of the Treasury, has effectively brought together all of the key United States Government agencies. In particular, United States Government agencies continue to work together to foster broad support for this important undertaking in various multilateral fora, and United States Government agencies recognize the need for close coordination and communication within our own Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Sense of Congress Regarding Success in Multilateral Organizations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury should continue to promote the dissemination of international AML and CFT standards, and to press for full implementation of the FATF 40 + 8 Recommendations by all countries in order to curb financial risks and hinder terrorist financing around the globe. The efforts of the Secretary in this regard should include, where necessary or appropriate, multilateral action against countries whose counter-money laundering regimes and efforts against the financing of terrorism fall below recognized international standards.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 7702. DEFINITIONS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;In this subtitle [subtitle G (&sect;&sect;7701&ndash;7704) of title VII of Pub. L. 108&ndash;458, amending sections 262<em>o</em>&ndash;2 and 262r&ndash;4 of Title 22, Foreign Relations and Intercourse]&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the term &lsquo;international financial institutions&rsquo; has the same meaning as in section 1701(c)(2) of the International Financial Institutions Act [22 U.S.C. 262r(c)(2)];</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the term &lsquo;Financial Action Task Force&rsquo; means the international policy-making and standard-setting body dedicated to combating money laundering and terrorist financing that was created by the Group of Seven in 1989; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the terms &lsquo;Interagency Paper on Sound Practices to Strengthen the Resilience of the U.S. Financial System&rsquo; and &lsquo;Interagency Paper&rsquo; mean the interagency paper prepared by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission that was announced in the Federal Register on April 8, 2003.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 7704. COORDINATION OF UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT EFFORTS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Secretary of the Treasury, or the designee of the Secretary, as the lead United States Government official to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), shall continue to convene the interagency United States Government FATF working group. This group, which includes representatives from all relevant Federal agencies, shall meet at least once a year to advise the Secretary on policies to be pursued by the United States regarding the development of common international AML and CFT standards, to assess the adequacy and implementation of such standards, and to recommend to the Secretary improved or new standards, as necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001; Findings and Purposes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;56, title III, &sect;302, Oct. 26, 2001, 115 Stat. 296, as amended by Pub. L. 108&ndash;458, title VI, &sect;6202(c), Dec. 17, 2004, 118 Stat. 3745, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) money laundering, estimated by the International Monetary Fund to amount to between 2 and 5 percent of global gross domestic product, which is at least $600,000,000,000 annually, provides the financial fuel that permits transnational criminal enterprises to conduct and expand their operations to the detriment of the safety and security of American citizens;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) money laundering, and the defects in financial transparency on which money launderers rely, are critical to the financing of global terrorism and the provision of funds for terrorist attacks;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) money launderers subvert legitimate financial mechanisms and banking relationships by using them as protective covering for the movement of criminal proceeds and the financing of crime and terrorism, and, by so doing, can threaten the safety of United States citizens and undermine the integrity of United States financial institutions and of the global financial and trading systems upon which prosperity and growth depend;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) certain jurisdictions outside of the United States that offer &lsquo;offshore&rsquo; banking and related facilities designed to provide anonymity, coupled with weak financial supervisory and enforcement regimes, provide essential tools to disguise ownership and movement of criminal funds derived from, or used to commit, offenses ranging from narcotics trafficking, terrorism, arms smuggling, and trafficking in human beings, to financial frauds that prey on law-abiding citizens;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) transactions involving such offshore jurisdictions make it difficult for law enforcement officials and regulators to follow the trail of money earned by criminals, organized international criminal enterprises, and global terrorist organizations;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) correspondent banking facilities are one of the banking mechanisms susceptible in some circumstances to manipulation by foreign banks to permit the laundering of funds by hiding the identity of real parties in interest to financial transactions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) private banking services can be susceptible to manipulation by money launderers, for example corrupt foreign government officials, particularly if those services include the creation of offshore accounts and facilities for large personal funds transfers to channel funds into accounts around the globe;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) United States anti-money laundering efforts are impeded by outmoded and inadequate statutory provisions that make investigations, prosecutions, and forfeitures more difficult, particularly in cases in which money laundering involves foreign persons, foreign banks, or foreign countries;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the ability to mount effective counter-measures to international money launderers requires national, as well as bilateral and multilateral action, using tools specially designed for that effort; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices and the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, of both of which the United States is a member, have each adopted international anti-money laundering principles and recommendations.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this title [see Short Title of 2001 Amendment note set out under section 5301 of this title] are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to increase the strength of United States measures to prevent, detect, and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to ensure that&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:343 --><p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) banking transactions and financial relationships and the conduct of such transactions and relationships, do not contravene the purposes of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, section 21 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1829b], or chapter 2 of title I of Public Law 91&ndash;508 (84 Stat. 1116) [12 U.S.C. 1951 et seq.], or facilitate the evasion of any such provision; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) the purposes of such provisions of law continue to be fulfilled, and such provisions of law are effectively and efficiently administered;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to strengthen the provisions put into place by the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 (18 U.S.C. 981 note) [see Short Title of 1986 Amendment note set out under section 981 of Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure], especially with respect to crimes by non-United States nationals and foreign financial institutions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to provide a clear national mandate for subjecting to special scrutiny those foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions operating outside of the United States, and classes of international transactions or types of accounts that pose particular, identifiable opportunities for criminal abuse;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to provide the Secretary of the Treasury (in this title referred to as the &lsquo;Secretary&rsquo;) with broad discretion, subject to the safeguards provided by the Administrative Procedure Act under title 5, United States Code [5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., 701 et seq.], to take measures tailored to the particular money laundering problems presented by specific foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions operating outside of the United States, and classes of international transactions or types of accounts;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) to ensure that the employment of such measures by the Secretary permits appropriate opportunity for comment by affected financial institutions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) to provide guidance to domestic financial institutions on particular foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions operating outside of the United States, and classes of international transactions or types of accounts that are of primary money laundering concern to the United States Government;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) to ensure that the forfeiture of any assets in connection with the anti-terrorist efforts of the United States permits for adequate challenge consistent with providing due process rights;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) to clarify the terms of the safe harbor from civil liability for filing suspicious activity reports;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) to strengthen the authority of the Secretary to issue and administer geographic targeting orders, and to clarify that violations of such orders or any other requirement imposed under the authority contained in chapter 2 of title I of Public Law 91&ndash;508 [12 U.S.C. 1951 et seq.] and subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, may result in criminal and civil penalties;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) to ensure that all appropriate elements of the financial services industry are subject to appropriate requirements to report potential money laundering transactions to proper authorities, and that jurisdictional disputes do not hinder examination of compliance by financial institutions with relevant reporting requirements;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) to strengthen the ability of financial institutions to maintain the integrity of their employee population; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) to strengthen measures to prevent the use of the United States financial system for personal gain by corrupt foreign officials and to facilitate the repatriation of any stolen assets to the citizens of countries to whom such assets belong.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Bulk Cash Smuggling Into or Out of the United States</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;56, title III, &sect;371(a), (b), Oct. 26, 2001, 115 Stat. 336, 337, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Effective enforcement of the currency reporting requirements of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, and the regulations prescribed under such subchapter, has forced drug dealers and other criminals engaged in cash-based businesses to avoid using traditional financial institutions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In their effort to avoid using traditional financial institutions, drug dealers and other criminals are forced to move large quantities of currency in bulk form to and through the airports, border crossings, and other ports of entry where the currency can be smuggled out of the United States and placed in a foreign financial institution or sold on the black market.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The transportation and smuggling of cash in bulk form may now be the most common form of money laundering, and the movement of large sums of cash is one of the most reliable warning signs of drug trafficking, terrorism, money laundering, racketeering, tax evasion and similar crimes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The intentional transportation into or out of the United States of large amounts of currency or monetary instruments, in a manner designed to circumvent the mandatory reporting provisions of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code,, [sic] is the equivalent of, and creates the same harm as, the smuggling of goods.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The arrest and prosecution of bulk cash smugglers are important parts of law enforcement's effort to stop the laundering of criminal proceeds, but the couriers who attempt to smuggle the cash out of the United States are typically low-level employees of large criminal organizations, and thus are easily replaced. Accordingly, only the confiscation of the smuggled bulk cash can effectively break the cycle of criminal activity of which the laundering of the bulk cash is a critical part.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The current penalties for violations of the currency reporting requirements are insufficient to provide a deterrent to the laundering of criminal proceeds. In particular, in cases where the only criminal violation under current law is a reporting offense, the law does not adequately provide for the confiscation of smuggled currency. In contrast, if the smuggling of bulk cash were itself an offense, the cash could be confiscated as the corpus delicti of the smuggling offense.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this section [enacting this section] are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to make the act of smuggling bulk cash itself a criminal offense;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to authorize forfeiture of any cash or instruments of the smuggling offense; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to emphasize the seriousness of the act of bulk cash smuggling.&rdquo;</p>
