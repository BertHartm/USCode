<p class="note-body">In this subchapter, the words &ldquo;surviving spouse&rdquo;, &ldquo;spouse&rdquo;, &ldquo;surviving spouse's&rdquo;, and &ldquo;parent&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;widow&rdquo;, &ldquo;wife&rdquo;, &ldquo;surviving widow's&rdquo;, and &ldquo;mother&rdquo;, respectively, because of 5:7202(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (3), the words &ldquo;or retired Comptroller General&rdquo; are omitted as executed because a retired Comptroller General could elect survivor benefits and include retirement service only if the Comptroller General had retired by July 13, 1959. The word &ldquo;total&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;complete months&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;twelfth parts thereof, excluding from the aggregate the fractional part of a month, if any&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;an individual is Comptroller General&rdquo; are added for clarity.</p>
