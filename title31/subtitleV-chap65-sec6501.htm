The words &ldquo;the transfer of anything of value for a public purpose of support or stimulation that is (A) authorized by a law of the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;programs that provide assistance&rdquo; for consistency with section 6101(3) of the revised title.

<p class="note-body">In clause (4)(B), the words &ldquo;a private, nonprofit community organization eligible to receive amounts under the Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9901 et seq.)&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;a community action agency under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as amended&rdquo; because of section 683(c)(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 97&ndash;35, 95 Stat. 519).</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (4)(C), the words &ldquo;whether public or private&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;law of the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Federal laws&rdquo; for consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (5), the words &ldquo;head of a Federal agency&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because heads of Federal agencies already have the authority to delegate.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (6), the words &ldquo;local government&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;political subdivision&rsquo; or &lsquo;local government&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and to have only one defined term in the chapter. The words &ldquo;unit of general local government&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;local unit of government, including specifically a county, municipality, city, town, township&rdquo; to incorporate the definition in clause (9).</p>
