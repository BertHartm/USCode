<p class="statutory-body">(a) The head of an executive or legislative agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall try to collect a claim of the United States Government for money or property arising out of the activities of, or referred to, the agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may compromise a claim of the Government of not more than $100,000 (excluding interest) or such higher amount as the Attorney General may from time to time prescribe that has not been referred to another executive or legislative agency for further collection action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) may suspend or end collection action on a claim referred to in clause (2) of this subsection when it appears that no person liable on the claim has the present or prospective ability to pay a significant amount of the claim or the cost of collecting the claim is likely to be more than the amount recovered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Comptroller General has the same authority that the head of the agency has under subsection (a) of this section when the claim is referred to the Comptroller General for further collection action.

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The head of an executive or legislative agency may not act under subsection (a)(2) or (3) of this section on a claim that appears to be fraudulent, false, or misrepresented by a party with an interest in the claim, or that is based on conduct in violation of the antitrust laws.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) A compromise under this section is final and conclusive unless gotten by fraud, misrepresentation, presenting a false claim, or mutual mistake of fact.

<p class="statutory-body">(e) The head of an executive or legislative agency acts under&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:183 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) regulations prescribed by the head of the agency; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notice required by section 552a(e)(4) of title 5 indicates that information in the system may be disclosed to a consumer reporting agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the head of the agency has reviewed the claim and decided that the claim is valid and overdue;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the head of the agency has notified the individual in writing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) that payment of the claim is overdue;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) that, within not less than 60 days after sending the notice, the head of the agency intends to disclose to a consumer reporting agency that the individual is responsible for the claim;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) of the specific information to be disclosed to the consumer reporting agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) of the rights the individual has to a complete explanation of the claim, to dispute information in the records of the agency about the claim, and to administrative repeal or review of the claim;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the individual has not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) repaid or agreed to repay the claim under a written repayment plan that the individual has signed and the head of the agency has agreed to; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) filed for review of the claim under paragraph (2) of this subsection;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the head of the agency has established procedures to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) disclose promptly, to each consumer reporting agency to which the original disclosure was made, a substantial change in the condition or amount of the claim;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) verify or correct promptly information about the claim on request of a consumer reporting agency for verification of information disclosed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) get satisfactory assurances from each consumer reporting agency that the agency is complying with all laws of the United States related to providing consumer credit information; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the information disclosed to the consumer reporting agency is limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) information necessary to establish the identity of the individual, including name, address, and taxpayer identification number;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the amount, status, and history of the claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the agency or program under which the claim arose.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before disclosing information to a consumer reporting agency under paragraph (1) of this subsection and at other times allowed by law, the head of an executive or legislative agency shall provide, on request of an individual alleged by the agency to be responsible for the claim, for a review of the obligation of the individual, including an opportunity for reconsideration of the initial decision on the claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Before disclosing information to a consumer reporting agency under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the head of an executive or legislative agency shall take reasonable action to locate an individual for whom the head of the agency does not have a current address to send the notice under paragraph (1)(C).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under conditions the head of an executive or legislative agency considers appropriate, the head of the agency may make a contract with a person for collection services to recover indebtedness owed the United States Government. The contract shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the head of the agency retains the authority to resolve a dispute, compromise a claim, end collection action, and refer a matter to the Attorney General to bring a civil action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the person is subject to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) section 552a of title 5, to the extent provided in section 552a(m); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) laws and regulations of the United States Government and State governments related to debt collection practices.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1)(A) The Attorney General may make contracts retaining private counsel to furnish legal services, including representation in negotiation, compromise, settlement, and litigation, in the case of any claim of indebtedness owed the United States. Each such contract shall include such terms and conditions as the Attorney General considers necessary and appropriate, including a provision specifying the amount of the fee to be paid to the private counsel under such contract or the method for calculating that fee. The amount of the fee payable for legal services furnished under any such contract may not exceed the fee that counsel engaged in the private practice of law in the area or areas where the legal services are furnished typically charge clients for furnishing legal services in the collection of claims of indebtedness, as determined by the Attorney General, considering the amount, age, and nature of the indebtedness and whether the debtor is an individual or a business entity. If the Attorney General makes a contract for legal services to be furnished in any judicial district of the United States under the first sentence of this paragraph, the Attorney General shall use his best efforts to obtain, from among attorneys regularly engaged in the private practice of law in such district, at least four such contracts for legal services with private individuals or firms in such district. Nothing in this subparagraph shall relieve the Attorney General of the competition requirements set forth in title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 and following).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Attorney General shall use his best efforts to enter into contracts under this paragraph with law firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, so as to enable each agency to comply with paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an executive or legislative agency may, subject to the approval of the Attorney General, refer to a private counsel retained under paragraph (1) of this subsection claims of indebtedness owed the United States arising out of activities of that agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each agency shall use its best efforts to assure that not less than 10 percent of the amounts of all claims referred to private counsel by that agency under paragraph (2) are referred to law firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the term &ldquo;law firm owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals&rdquo; means a law firm that meets the requirements set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of section 8(d)(3)(C) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(3)(C)(i) and (ii)) and regulations issued under those clauses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) &ldquo;socially and economically disadvantaged individuals&rdquo; shall be presumed to include these groups and individuals described in the last paragraph of section 8(d)(3)(C) of the Small Business Act.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding sections 516, 518(b), 519, and 547(2) of title 28, a private counsel retained under paragraph (1) of this subsection may represent the United States in litigation in connection with legal services furnished pursuant to the contract entered into with that counsel under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A contract made with a private counsel under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a provision permitting the Attorney General to terminate either the contract or the private counsel's representation of the United States in particular cases if the Attorney General finds that such action is for the convenience of the Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a provision stating that the head of the executive or legislative agency which refers a claim under the contract retains the authority to resolve a dispute regarding the claim, to compromise the claim, or to terminate a collection action on the claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a provision requiring the private counsel to transmit monthly to the Attorney General and the head of the executive or legislative agency referring a claim under the contract a report on the services relating to the claim rendered under the contract during the month and the progress made during the month in collecting the claim under the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Notwithstanding the fourth sentence of section 803(6) of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 1692a(6)), a private counsel performing legal services pursuant to a contract made under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be considered to be a debt collector for the purposes of such Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Any counterclaim filed in any action to recover indebtedness owed the United States which is brought on behalf of the United States by private counsel retained under this subsection may not be asserted unless the counterclaim is served directly on the Attorney General or the United States Attorney for the judicial district in which, or embracing the place in which, the action is brought. Such service shall be made in accordance with the rules of procedure of the court in which the action is brought.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Attorney General shall transmit to the Congress an annual report on the activities of the Department of Justice to recover indebtedness owed the United States which was referred to the Department of Justice for collection. Each such report shall include a list, by agency, of&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:189 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the total number and amounts of claims which were referred for legal services to the Department of Justice and to private counsel under subsection (b) during the 1-year period covered by the report;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the total number and amount of those claims referred for legal services to the Department of Justice which were collected or were not collected or otherwise resolved during the 1-year period covered by the report; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the total number and amount of those claims referred for legal services to private counsel under subsection (b)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which were collected or were not collected or otherwise resolved during the 1-year period covered by the report;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which were not collected or otherwise resolved under a contract terminated by the Attorney General during the 1-year period covered by the report; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) on which the Attorney General terminated the private counsel's representation during the 1-year period covered by the report without terminating the contract with the private counsel under which the claims were referred.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Notwithstanding section 3302(b) of this title, a contract under subsection (a) or (b) of this section may provide that a fee a person charges to recover indebtedness owed the United States Government is payable from the amount recovered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A contract under subsection (a) or (b) of this section is effective only to the extent and in the amount provided in an appropriation law. This limitation does not apply in the case of a contract that authorizes a person to collect a fee as provided in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) This section does not apply to the collection of debts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) In order to assist Congress in determining whether use of private counsel is a cost-effective method of collecting Government debts, the Attorney General shall, following consultation with the General Accounting Office, maintain and make available to the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, statistical data relating to the comparative costs of debt collection by participating United States Attorneys&rsquo; Offices and by private counsel.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The requirements of subsection (b) shall not be treated as met in the case of the recovery of an OASDI overpayment from any individual under this section unless the notification under subsection (b)(1) describes the conditions under which the Commissioner of Social Security is required to waive recovery of an overpayment, as provided under section 204(b) of the Social Security Act.</p>
