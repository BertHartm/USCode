The Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) determine the amount allocated to the State under subsection (b) or (c) of this section and allocate the larger amount to the State; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Relative income factor</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The relative income factor of a State is a fraction in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the numerator is the per capita income of the United States; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Relative rate of labor force</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The relative rate of the labor force unemployed in a State is a fraction in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the numerator is the percentage of the labor force of the State that is unemployed in the calendar year preceding the payment period (as determined by the Secretary of Labor for general statistical purposes); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the denominator is the percentage of the labor force of the United States that is unemployed in the calendar year preceding the payment period (as determined by the Secretary of Labor for general statistical purposes).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Alternative Formula</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For the payment period beginning October 1, 1994, the amount allocated to a State under this subsection for a payment period is the total amount the State would receive if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) $1,166,666,667 were allocated among the States on the basis of population by allocating to each State an amount bearing the same ratio to the total amount to be allocated under this paragraph as the population of the State bears to the population of all States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) $1,166,666,667 were allocated among the States on the basis of population inversely weighted for per capita income, by allocating to each State an amount bearing the same ratio to the total amount to be allocated under this paragraph as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the population of the State, multiplied by a fraction in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the numerator is the per capita income of all States; and</p>

In this paragraph, the term &ldquo;urbanized population&rdquo; means the population of an area consisting of a central city or cities of at least 50,000 inhabitants and the surrounding closely settled area for the city or cities considered as an urbanized area as published by the Bureau of the Census for 1990 in the publication General Population Characteristics for Urbanized Areas.</p>

The income tax amount for a payment period shall be at least 1 percent but not more than 6 percent of the United States Government individual income tax liability attributed to the State for the taxable year ending during the last calendar year ending before the beginning of the payment period. The Secretary shall determine the Government income tax liability attributed to the State by using the data published by the Secretary for 1991 in the publication Statistics of Income Bulletin (Winter 1993&ndash;1994).</p>
