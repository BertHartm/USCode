<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Domestic control of coinage</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), in order to protect the national security through domestic control of the coinage process, the Secretary shall acquire only such articles, materials, supplies, and services (including equipment, manufacturing facilities, patents, patent rights, technical knowledge, and assistance) for the production of coins as have been produced or manufactured in the United States unless the Secretary determines it to be inconsistent with the public interest, or the cost to be unreasonable, and publishes in the Federal Register a written finding stating the basis for the determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Subparagraph (A) shall apply only in the case of a bid or offer from a supplier the principal place of business of which is in a foreign country which does not accord to United States companies the same competitive opportunities for procurements in connection with the production of coins as it accords to domestic companies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Determination.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any determination of the Secretary referred to in paragraph (2) shall not be reviewable in any administrative proceeding or court of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Other rights unaffected</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This paragraph does not alter or annul any right of review that arises under any provision of any law or regulation of the United States other than paragraph (2).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Nothing in paragraph (2) of this subsection in any way affects the procurement by the Secretary of gold and silver for the production of coins by the United States Mint.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person knowingly violating an order or license issued or regulation prescribed under paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall be fined not more than $10,000, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Coins exported, melted, or treated in violation of an order or license issued or regulation prescribed, and metal resulting from the melting or treatment, shall be forfeited to the United States Government. The powers of the Secretary and the remedies available to enforce forfeitures are those provided in part II of subchapter C of chapter 75 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954&nbsp;<sup><a href="#5111_1_target" name="5111_1">1</a></sup> (26 U.S.C. 7321 et seq.).</p>
