<p class="note-body">In the section, before clause (1), the words &ldquo;have the responsibility to assure compliance with the requirements of this chapter&rdquo; in 31:1054(a) are omitted as unnecessary because of section 321 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;(except under section 5315 of this title and regulations prescribed under section 5315)&rdquo; are added because 31:1141&ndash;1143 was not enacted as a part of the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act that is restated in this subchapter. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;duties and powers&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;responsibilities&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words &ldquo;bank supervisory agency, or other&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In clause (2), the words &ldquo;by regulation&rdquo; and &ldquo;as he may deem&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;and regulations prescribed under this subchapter&rdquo; are added because of the restatement. In clause (3), the word &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;make&rdquo; in 31:1055 for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The words &ldquo;otherwise imposed&rdquo;, 31:1055(1st sentence), and the words &ldquo;in his discretion&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
