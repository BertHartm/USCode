<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words before clause (1) are added because of the restatement. In clause (5), the words &ldquo;that is 0.835 inch in diameter&rdquo; are added because the Secretary of the Treasury has prescribed the diameter and the diameter of a coin may not be changed under 31:276. The words &ldquo;5 grams&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;seventy-seven and sixteen-hundredths grains troy&rdquo; for consistency in the revised chapter. In clause (6), the words &ldquo;that is 0.75 inch in diameter&rdquo; are added because the Secretary has prescribed the diameter and the diameter of a coin may not be changed under 31:276. The words &ldquo;except as provided under subsection (c) of this section&rdquo; are added for clarity and because of the restatement. The words &ldquo;3.11 grams&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;forty-eight grains&rdquo; for consistency in the revised chapter.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;In minting 5-cent coins&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;in minor-coinage alloys&rdquo; in 31:346 because 5-cent coins are the minor coins composed of nickel. The words &ldquo;Secretary shall use&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall be used&rdquo; because of the source provisions restated in section 321 of the revised title. The word &ldquo;bars&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;ingots&rdquo; for consistency in the revised chapter. The words &ldquo;2.5 percent&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;twenty-five thousandths&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words &ldquo;from the percent of nickel required&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the legal standard .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the proportion of nickel&rdquo; because of the restatement. The words &ldquo;In silver ingots, six-thousandths&rdquo; are omitted as superseded by the source provisions restated in the section. The words &ldquo;In gold ingots, one-thousandth&rdquo; in section 3533 of the Revised Statutes are omitted because gold coinage was discontinued by 31:315b. The words &ldquo;Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section&rdquo; are added for clarity and because of the restatement.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;a different weight and alloy of copper and zinc&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;such action&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d)(1), the words &ldquo;an impression emblematic of liberty&rdquo; in 31:324 are omitted as obsolete. The words &ldquo;The design on the reverse side of the dollar, half dollar, and quarter dollar is an eagle&rdquo; are sub<!-- PDFPage:259 -->stituted for &ldquo;and upon the reverse side shall be the figure or representation of an eagle .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but on the dime, 5-, and 1-cent piece, the figure of the eagle shall be omitted&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;The emblem on the obverse side of the dollar is&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;The one-dollar coin authorized by section 391(c) of this title shall bear on the obverse side&rdquo; in 31:324b&ndash;1, to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;Any coins minted after July 23, 1965, from 900 fine coin silver shall be inscribed with the year 1964&rdquo; in 31:324 are omitted because the Secretary no longer has authority to mint coins from 900 fine coin silver.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d)(2), the word &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;engraver&rdquo;, &ldquo;Director of the Mint&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Director of the Mint .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury&rdquo; because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. The word &ldquo;dies&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;from the original dies already authorized all the working dies required for use in the coinage of the several mints&rdquo; and &ldquo;original dies&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The word &ldquo;inscription&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;legend&rdquo; for consistency in the section. The words &ldquo;<em>Provided</em>, That no change be made in the diameter of any coin&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because the diameters are prescribed by subsection (a) of the revised section. The words &ldquo;procure services under section 3109 of title 5 in carrying out this paragraph&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;engage temporarily for this purpose the services of one or more artists, distinguished in their respective departments of art&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;who shall be paid for such service from the contingent appropriation for the mint at Philadelphia&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete. The text of section 3510(2d proviso) of the Revised Statutes is omitted as executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e)(2), the words &ldquo;80 percent&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;eight hundred parts&rdquo; in 31:391(d), and the words &ldquo;20 percent&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;two hundred parts&rdquo;, for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The words &ldquo;that are metallurgically bonded to&rdquo; are added for clarity and consistency with subsection (b). In clause (4), the words &ldquo;the late President of the United States&rdquo; in 31:324b are omitted as unnecessary. Clause (6) is added because 31:324 applies to coins minted under this subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f)(1), before clause (A), the words &ldquo;Notwithstanding this section and section 5111(a)(1) of this title are substituted for &ldquo;Notwithstanding any other provision of law&rdquo; in 31:399 for clarity. In clause (B), the words &ldquo;are an alloy of 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;be minted in accordance with the standard established in section 3514 of the Revised Statutes (31 U.S.C. 321)&rdquo; and 31:321 to eliminate unnecessary words and for clarity. In clause (C), the word &ldquo;symbolizing&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;emblematic&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f)(2), the words &ldquo;under such regulations as he may prescribe&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of section 321 of the revised title. The word &ldquo;Treasury&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;general fund of the Treasury&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">The text of 31:399(b)(3) is omitted as unnecessary because of section 5103 of the revised title.</p>

When practicable, the Secretary shall weigh the bullion in front of the depositor. The Secretary shall give the depositor a receipt for the bullion stating the description and weight of the bullion. When the Secretary has to melt the bullion or remove base metals before the value of the bullion can be determined, the weight is the weight after the melting or removal of the metals.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine the fineness, weight, and value of each deposit and bar under section 5121 of this title. The value and the amount of charges under subsection (b) of this section shall be based on the fineness and weight of the bullion. The Secretary shall give the depositor a statement of the charges and the net amount of the deposit to be paid in money or bars of the same species of bullion as that deposited.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary shall impose a charge equal to the average cost of material, labor, waste, and use of machinery of a United States mint or assay office for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) melting and refining bullion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) using copper as an alloy when bullion deposited is above standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) separating gold and silver combined in the bullion; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) preparing bars.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary shall pay to the depositor or to a person designated by the depositor money or bars equivalent to the bullion deposited as soon as practicable after the value of the deposit is determined. If demanded, the Secretary shall pay depositors in the order in which the bullion is deposited with the Secretary. However, when there is an unavoidable delay in determining the value of a deposit, the Secretary shall pay subsequent depositors. When practicable and convenient, the Secretary shall pay depositors in the denominations requested by the depositor. After the depositor is paid, the bullion is the property of the United States Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) To allow the Secretary to pay depositors with as little delay as possible, the Secretary shall keep in the mints and assay offices, when possible, money and bullion the Secretary decides are convenient and necessary.</p>
