<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;Secretary of the Treasury&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Treasurer&rdquo; because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. The words &ldquo;may issue a check or other draft&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall be subject to the draft of&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;public money&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;moneys&rdquo; because section 10 of the Act of August 6, 1846 (ch. 90, 9 Stat. 61), from which section 3644 of the Revised Statutes is derived, used the term &ldquo;public money&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;obligation of the United States Government&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;on the public account&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;may designate a depositary to issue a check or draft on public money held by the depositary to pay an obligation of the Government&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;is authorized to draw upon any of the depositaries&rdquo; for clarity and consistency. The words &ldquo;at such times and in such forms .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall be&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;United States Postal Service&rdquo; and &ldquo;Postmaster General&rdquo; are omitted because of 39:410. The words &ldquo;report to the Secretary on public money paid and received by the depositary&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;so drawn upon shall make returns to the Treasury Department&rdquo; for clarity and consistency.</p>
