<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is properly classified pursuant to such Executive order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The functions and activities of this section shall be considered to be inherently Governmental functions. The drafting of performance plans under this section shall be performed only by Federal employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) With respect to each agency with a Chief Human Capital Officer, the Chief Human Capital Officer shall prepare that portion of the annual performance plan described under subsection (a)(3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) For purposes of this section and sections 1116 through 1119, and sections 9703&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1115_2_target" name="1115_2">2</a></sup> and 9704 the term&mdash;</p>
