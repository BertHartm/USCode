<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is properly classified pursuant to such Executive order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The functions and activities of this section shall be considered to be inherently Governmental functions. The drafting of performance plans under this section shall be performed only by Federal employees.</p>
