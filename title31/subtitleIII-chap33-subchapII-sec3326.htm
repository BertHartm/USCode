<p class="statutory-body">(a) When the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller General decide that, with sufficient safeguards, existing procedures may be changed to simplify, improve, and economize the control and accounting of public money, they may prescribe joint regulations for waiving any part of the requirements in effect on September 12, 1950, that&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;in effect on September 12, 1950&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;existing&rdquo; for clarity. In clause (2), the words &ldquo;under each separate appropriation head or otherwise&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the word &ldquo;official&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;officers&rdquo; for consistency. The word &ldquo;Treasury&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;Treasurer of the United States&rdquo; because of the source provisions restated in section 321 of the revised title and Department of the Treasury Order 229 of January 14, 1974 (39 F.R. 2280). The words &ldquo;in the rendition of their accounts or for other&rdquo; and &ldquo;under necessary circumstances&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
