<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;officer or employee&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;official or agency&rdquo; for clarity and consistency with other titles of the United States Code. The word &ldquo;Government&rdquo; is added for consistency. The words &ldquo;section 1005 of Appendix to title 50&rdquo; are omitted because the section was repealed by section 8(a) of the Act of Sept. 6, 1966 (Pub. L. 89&ndash;554, 80 Stat. 651). The words &ldquo;or by any other&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;or by the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of the Navy&rdquo; are omitted because of 10:ch. 75. The word &ldquo;official&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;officer&rdquo; for consistency. The words &ldquo;bonds and other&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;Secretary of the Treasury&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Treasury Department&rdquo; for accuracy and consistency.</p>
