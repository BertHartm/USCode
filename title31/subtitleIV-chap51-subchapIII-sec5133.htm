<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;superintendent of each mint and the assay office at New York and the officer <!-- PDFPage:290 -->in charge of the assay office at San Francisco&rdquo; are added because of the source provisions restated in section 5131(b) and (c) of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;shall settle&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;and at such time as the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall appoint, there shall be an accurate and full settlement&rdquo; in 31:354(last sentence) to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;The Secretary shall audit&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;When all the coins, clippings, and other bullion have been delivered to the superintendent, it shall be his duty to examine&rdquo; in 31:355(1st, 2d sentences) to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (2), the words &ldquo;the waste of precious metals .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. decides is necessary for refining and minting&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;The difference between the amount charged and credited to each officer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as necessary wastage, if .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall be satisfied that there has been a bona fide waste of the precious metals&rdquo; for consistency in the subsection and to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (3), the words &ldquo;limitations prescribed for refining&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;that provided for the melter and refiner&rdquo; in 31:283(2d, last sentences) for consistency in the subsection. The word &ldquo;bona fide&rdquo; is omitted as being included in &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;It shall also be the duty of the superintendent to forward a correct statement of his balance sheet&rdquo; are omitted as superseded by the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. The words &ldquo;mints and assay offices&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;mint&rdquo; for consistency in the section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words &ldquo;National Bureau of Standards of the Department of Commerce&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Bureau of Standards of the United States&rdquo; because of 15:1511. The words &ldquo;from .01 grain&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;from the hundredths part of a grain&rdquo; for consistency. The words &ldquo;under the inspection of the superintendent and assayer&rdquo; are omitted as superseded by the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. The words &ldquo;and the accuracy of those used at the mint at Philadelphia shall be tested annually in the presence of the assay commissioners, at the time of the annual examination and test of coins&rdquo; are omitted because the position of assay commissioner was abolished by section 201 of the Act of March 14, 1980 (Pub. L. 96&ndash;209, 94 Stat. 98).</p>
