<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;head of an agency&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for a military department, the Secretary of the military department;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for the Department of Defense (except the military departments), the Secretary of Defense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) for another agency, the head of the agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) &ldquo;settle&rdquo; means consider, determine, adjust, and dispose of a claim by disallowance or by complete or partial allowance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The head of an agency may settle and pay not more than $40,000 for a claim against the Government made by a member of the uniformed services under the jurisdiction of the agency or by an officer or employee of the agency for damage to, or loss of, personal property incident to service. A claim allowed under this subsection may be paid in money or the personal property replaced in kind.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of State may waive the settlement and payment limitation referred to in paragraph (1) for claims for damage or loss by United States Government personnel under the jurisdiction of a chief of mission in a foreign country if such claims arise in circumstances where there is in effect a departure from the country authorized or ordered under circumstances described in section 5522(a) of title 5, if the Secretary determines that there exists exceptional circumstances that warrant such a waiver.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) On paying a claim under this section, the Government is subrogated for the amount of the payment to a right or claim that the claimant may have against a foreign country for the damage or loss for which the Government made the payment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the head of the agency decides that possession of the property was reasonable or useful under the circumstances; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) A claim may be allowed under this section only if it is presented in writing within 2 years after the claim accrues. However, if a claim under subsection (b) of this section accrues during war or an armed conflict in which an armed force of the United States is involved, or has accrued within 2 years before war or an armed conflict begins, and for cause shown, the claim must be presented within 2 years after the cause no longer exists or after the war or armed conflict ends, whichever is earlier.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a child's claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a parent's claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a brother's or sister's claim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Notwithstanding a contract, the representative of a claimant may not receive more than 10 percent of a payment of a claim made under this section for services related to the claim. A person violating this subsection shall be fined not more than $1,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) The President may prescribe policies to carry out this section (except subsection (b) to the extent that subsection (b) applies to the military departments, the Department of Defense, and the Coast Guard). Subject to those <!-- PDFPage:194 -->policies, the head of each agency shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section.</p>
