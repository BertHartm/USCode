<!-- PDFPage:339 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Theodore Roosevelt was this nation's 26th President and is considered by many to be our &lsquo;Conservationist President&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) As a frequent visitor to the West, Theodore Roosevelt witnessed the virtual destruction of some big game species and the overgrazing that destroyed the grasslands and with them the habitats for small mammals and songbirds and conservation increasingly became one of his major concerns.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) When he became President in 1901, Roosevelt pursued this interest in conservation by establishing the first 51 Bird Reserves, 4 Game Preserves, and 150 National Forests.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) He also established the United States Forest Service, signed into law the creation of 5 National Parks, and signed the Act for the Preservation of American Antiquities in 1906 under which he proclaimed 18 national monuments.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Approximately 230,000,000 acres of area within the United States was placed under public protection by Theodore Roosevelt.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;145, title I, &sect;101, Dec. 22, 2005, 119 Stat. 2664, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) There are sectors of the United States economy, including public transportation, parking meters, vending machines, and low-dollar value transactions, in which the use of a $1 coin is both useful and desirable for keeping costs and prices down.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) For a variety of reasons, the new $1 coin introduced in 2000 has not been widely sought-after by the public, leading to higher costs for merchants and thus higher prices for consumers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The success of the 50 States Commemorative Coin Program (31 U.S.C. 5112(<em>l</em>)) for circulating quarter dollars shows that a design on a United States circulating coin that is regularly changed in a manner similar to the systematic change in designs in such Program radically increases demand for the coin, rapidly pulling it through the economy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The 50 States Commemorative Coin Program also has been an educational tool, teaching both Americans and visitors something about each State for which a quarter has been issued.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) A national survey and study by the Government Accountability Office has indicated that many Americans who do not seek, or who reject, the new $1 coin for use in commerce would actively seek the coin if an attractive, educational rotating design were to be struck on the coin.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The President is the leader of our tripartite government and the President's spouse has often set the social tone for the White House while spearheading and highlighting important issues for the country.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Sacagawea, as currently represented on the new $1 coin, is an important symbol of American history.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Many people cannot name all of the Presidents, and fewer can name the spouses, nor can many people accurately place each President in the proper time period of American history.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) First Spouses have not generally been recognized on American coinage.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) In order to revitalize the design of United States coinage and return circulating coinage to its position as not only a necessary means of exchange in commerce, but also as an object of aesthetic beauty in its own right, it is appropriate to move many of the mottos and emblems, the inscription of the year, and the so-called &lsquo;mint marks&rsquo; that currently appear on the 2 faces of each circulating coin to the edge of the coin, which would allow larger and more dramatic artwork on the coins reminiscent of the so-called &lsquo;Golden Age of Coinage&rsquo; in the United States, at the beginning of the Twentieth Century, initiated by President Theodore Roosevelt, with the assistance of noted sculptors and medallic artists James Earle Fraser and Augustus Saint-Gaudens.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Placing inscriptions on the edge of coins, known as edge-incusing, is a hallmark of modern coinage and is common in large-volume production of coinage elsewhere in the world, such as the 2,700,000,000 2-Euro coins in circulation, but it has not been done on a large scale in United States coinage in recent years.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Although the Congress has authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue gold coins with a purity of 99.99 percent, the Secretary has not done so.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) Bullion coins are a valuable tool for the investor and, in some cases, an important aspect of coin collecting.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;145, title III, Dec. 22, 2005, 119 Stat. 2673, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 301. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, was one of the Nation's greatest leaders, demonstrating true courage during the Civil War, one of the greatest crises in the Nation's history.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Born of humble roots in Hardin County (present-day LaRue County), Kentucky, on February 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln rose to the Presidency through a combination of honesty, integrity, intelligence, and commitment to the United States.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:340 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) With the belief that all men are created equal, Abraham Lincoln led the effort to free all slaves in the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Abraham Lincoln had a generous heart, with malice toward none, and with charity for all.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Abraham Lincoln gave the ultimate sacrifice for the country he loved, dying from an assassin's bullet on April 15, 1865.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of Abraham Lincoln, for Lincoln's life is a model for accomplishing the &lsquo;American dream&rsquo; through honesty, integrity, loyalty, and a lifetime of education.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The year 2009 will be the bicentennial anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky, grew to adulthood in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, and led the nation in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The so-called &lsquo;Lincoln cent&rsquo; was introduced in 1909 on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, making the obverse design the most enduring on the nation's coinage.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) President Theodore Roosevelt was so impressed by the talent of Victor David Brenner that the sculptor was chosen to design the likeness of President Lincoln for the coin, adapting a design from a plaque Brenner had prepared earlier.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) In the nearly 100 years of production of the &lsquo;Lincoln cent&rsquo;, there have been only 2 designs on the reverse: the original, featuring 2 wheat-heads in memorial style enclosing mottoes, and the current representation of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) On the occasion of the bicentennial of President Lincoln's birth and the 100th anniversary of the production of the Lincoln cent, it is entirely fitting to issue a series of 1-cent coins with designs on the reverse that are emblematic of the 4 major periods of President Lincoln's life.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 302. REDESIGN OF LINCOLN CENT FOR 2009.</h4>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) his formative years in Indiana;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) his professional life in Illinois; and</p>
