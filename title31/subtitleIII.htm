<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In issuing obligations under sections 3102&ndash;3104 of this title, the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) whether an obligation is to be issued on an interest-bearing basis, a discount basis, or an interest-bearing and discount basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) regulations on the conditions under which the obligation will be offered for sale, including whether it will be offered for sale on a competitive or other basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the offering price and interest rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the method of computing the interest rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the dates for paying principal and interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the form and denominations of the obligations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) other conditions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, an obligation issued under this chapter and redeemable on demand of the owner or holder may be used to pay the United States Government for taxes imposed by it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An obligation of the Government issued after March 3, 1971, under law may not be redeemed before its maturity to pay a tax imposed by the Government in an amount more than the fair market value of the obligation at the time of its redemption. This paragraph does not apply to a Treasury bill issued under section 3104 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, an obligation authorized by this chapter may be issued in exchange for an obligation of an agency whose principal and interest are unconditionally guaranteed by the Government at or before maturity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, the Secretary may issue registered bonds in exchange for and instead of coupon bonds that have been or may be issued. The registered bonds shall be similar in all respects to the registered bonds issued under a law authorizing the issue of coupon bonds offered for exchange.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A decision of the Secretary about an issue of obligations under sections 3102&ndash;3104 of this title is final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary may accept voluntary services in carrying out the sale of public debt obligations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;registration-required obligation&rdquo; means an obligation except an obligation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) not of a type offered to the public;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) having a maturity (at issue) of not more than one year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) described in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An obligation is not a registration-required obligation if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there are arrangements reasonably designed to ensure that the obligation will be sold (or resold in connection with the original issue) only to a person that is not a United States person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for an obligation not in registered form&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) interest on the obligation is payable only outside the United States and its territories and possessions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a statement is on the face of the obligation that a United States person holding the obligation is subject to limitations under the United States income tax laws.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Every registration-required obligation of the Government shall be in registered form. A book entry obligation is deemed to be in registered form if the right to principal and stated interest on the obligation may be transferred only through a book entry consistent with regulations of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations necessary to carry out this subsection when there is a nominee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation standards for the safeguarding and use of obligations issued under this chapter, and obligations otherwise issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the United States. Such regulations shall apply only to a depository institution that is not a government securities broker or a government securities dealer and that holds such obligations as fiduciary, custodian, or otherwise for the account of a customer and not for its own account. Such regulations shall provide for the adequate segregation of obligations so held, including obligations which are purchased or sold subject to resale or repurchase.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Violation of a regulation prescribed under paragraph (1) shall constitute adequate basis for the issuance of an order under section 5239(a) or (b) of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 93(a) or (b)), section 8(b) or 8(c) of the Federal Deposit <!-- PDFPage:142 -->Insurance Act, section 5(d)(2) or 5(d)(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3121_1_target" name="3121_1">1</a></sup> of the Home Owners&rsquo; Loan Act of 1933, section 407(e) or 407(f)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3121_1_target" name="3121_1">1</a></sup> of the National Housing Act, or section 206(e) or 206(f) of the Federal Credit Union Act. Such an order may be issued with respect to a depository institution by its appropriate regulatory agency and with respect to a federally insured credit union by the National Credit Union Administration Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect in any way the powers of such agencies under any other provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall, prior to adopting regulations under this subsection, determine with respect to each appropriate regulatory agency and the National Credit Union Administration Board, whether its rules and standards adequately meet the purposes of regulations to be promulgated under this subsection, and if the Secretary so determines, shall exempt any depository institution subject to such rules or standards from the regulations promulgated under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) As used in this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) &ldquo;depository institution&rdquo; has the meaning stated in clauses (i) through (vi) of section 19(b)(1)(A) of the Federal Reserve Act and also includes a foreign bank, an agency or branch of a foreign bank, and a commercial lending company owned or controlled by a foreign bank (as such terms are defined in the International Banking Act of 1978).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) &ldquo;government securities broker&rdquo; has the meaning prescribed in section 3(a)(43) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) &ldquo;government securities dealer&rdquo; has the meaning prescribed in section 3(a)(44) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) &ldquo;appropriate regulatory agency&rdquo; has the meaning prescribed in section 3(a)(34)(G) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Stocks and obligations of the United States Government are exempt from taxation by a State or political subdivision of a State. The exemption applies to each form of taxation that would require the obligation, the interest on the obligation, or both, to be considered in computing a tax, except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a nondiscriminatory franchise tax or another nonproperty tax instead of a franchise tax, imposed on a corporation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an estate or inheritance tax.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The tax status of interest on obligations and dividends, earnings, or other income from evidences of ownership issued by the Government or an agency and the tax treatment of gain and loss from the disposition of those obligations and evidences of ownership is decided under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.). An obligation that the Federal Housing Administration had agreed, under a contract made before March 1, 1941, to issue at a future date, has the tax exemption privileges provided by the authorizing law at the time of the contract. This subsection does not apply to obligations and evidences of ownership issued by the District of Columbia, a territory or possession of the United States, or a department, agency, instrumentality, or political subdivision of the District, territory, or possession.</p>

A Federal reserve bank, a paying agent allowed to make payments in redeeming a bond or note, or an officer or employee of the Department of the Treasury is relieved from liability to the United States Government for the loss when the Secretary decides that the loss did not result from the fault or negligence of the bank, paying agent, officer, or employee. The Secretary shall relieve the bank, agent, officer, or employee from liability when the Secretary decides that written notice of liability or potential liability has not been given to the bank, agent, officer, or employee by the Government within 10 years from the date of the erroneous payment. However, the Secretary may not relieve a paying agent of an assumed unconditional liability to the Government.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Department of the Treasury has a special deposit revolving fund, the &ldquo;Check Forgery Insurance Fund&rdquo;. Necessary amounts are hereafter appropriated to the Fund out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and shall remain available until expended to make the payments required or authorized under this section. The Fund consists of amounts&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) appropriated to the Fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) received under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary of the Treasury shall pay from the Fund to a payee or special endorsee of a check drawn on the Treasury or a depositary designated by the Secretary the amount of the check without interest if in the determination of the Secretary the payee or special endorse&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3343_1_target" name="3343_1">1</a></sup> establishes that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the check was lost or stolen without the fault of the payee or a holder that is a special endorsee and whose endorsement is necessary for further negotiation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the check was negotiated later and paid by the Secretary or a depositary on a forged endorsement of the payee's or special endorsee's name; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the payee or special endorsee has not participated in any part of the proceeds of the negotiation or payment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Notwithstanding section 1306 of this title, a check drawn on a designated depositary may be paid in the currency of a foreign country when the appropriate accountable official authorizes payment in that currency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary shall deposit immediately to the credit of the Fund an amount recovered from a forger or a transferee or party on the check. The Secretary may use amounts in the Fund to reimburse payment certifying or authorizing agencies for any payment that the Secretary determines would otherwise have been payable from the Fund, and may reimburse certifying or authorizing agencies with amounts recovered because of payee nonentitlement. However, currency of a foreign country recovered because of a forged check drawn on a designated depositary shall be credited to the Fund or to the foreign currency fund that was charged when payment was made under subsection (b) of this section to the payee or special endorsee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary may waive any provision of this section as may be necessary to ensure that claimants receive timely payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Under such conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may delegate duties and powers of the Secretary under this section to the head of an agency. Consistent with a delegation from the Secretary under this subsection, the head of an agency may redelegate those duties and powers to officers or employees of the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) This section does not relieve&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a forger from civil or criminal liability; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a transferee or party on a check after the forgery from liability&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) on the express or implied warranty of prior endorsements of the transferee or party; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to refund amounts to the Secretary.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 101(f) [title VIII] of Pub. L. 104&ndash;208 provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 801. SHORT TITLE[.]</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This title may be cited as the &lsquo;Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996.&rsquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 802. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Much effort has been devoted to strengthening Federal internal accounting controls in the past. Although progress has been made in recent years, Federal accounting standards have not been uniformly implemented in financial management systems for agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Federal financial management continues to be seriously deficient, and Federal financial management and fiscal practices have failed to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) identify costs fully;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) reflect the total liabilities of congressional actions; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) accurately report the financial condition of the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Current Federal accounting practices do not accurately report financial results of the Federal Government or the full costs of programs and activities. The continued use of these practices undermines the Government's ability to provide credible and reliable financial data and encourages already widespread Government waste, and will not assist in achieving a balanced budget.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Waste and inefficiency in the Federal Government undermine the confidence of the American people in the government and reduce the federal Government's ability to address vital public needs adequately.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) To rebuild the accountability and credibility of the Federal Government, and restore public confidence in the Federal Government, agencies must incorporate accounting standards and reporting objectives established for the Federal Government into their financial management systems so that all the assets and liabilities, revenues, and expenditures or expenses, and the full costs of programs and activities of the Federal Government can be consistently and accurately recorded, monitored, and uniformly reported throughout the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Since its establishment in October 1990, the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (hereinafter referred to as the &lsquo;FASAB&rsquo;) has made substantial progress toward developing and recommending a comprehensive set of accounting concepts and standards for the Federal Government. When the accounting concepts and standards developed by FASAB are incorporated into Federal financial management systems, agencies will be able to provide cost and financial information that will assist the Congress and financial managers to evaluate the cost and performance of Federal programs and activities, and will therefore provide important information that has been lacking, but is needed for improved decision making by financial managers and the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The development of financial management systems with the capacity to support these standards and concepts will, over the long term, improve Federal financial management.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>[.]&mdash;The purposes of this Act [title] are to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) provide for consistency of accounting by an agency from one fiscal year to the next, and uniform accounting standards throughout the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) require Federal financial management systems to support full disclosure of Federal financial data, including the full costs of Federal programs and activities, to the citizens, the Congress, the President, and agency management, so that programs and activities can be considered based on their full costs and merits;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) increase the accountability and credibility of federal [sic] financial management;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) improve performance, productivity and efficiency of Federal Government financial management;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) establish financial management systems to support controlling the cost of Federal Government;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) build upon and complement the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (Public Law 101&ndash;576; 104 Stat 2838) [see Short Title of 1990 Amendment note set out under section 501 of this title], the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (Public Law 103&ndash;62[;] 107 Stat. 285) [see Short Title of 1993 Amendment note set out under section 1101 of this title] and the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (Public Law 103&ndash;356; 108 Stat. 3410) [see Short Title of 1994 Amendment note set out under section 3301 of this title]; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) increase the capability of agencies to monitor execution of the budget by more readily permitting <!-- PDFPage:172 -->reports that compare spending of resources to results of activities.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 803. IMPLEMENTATION OF FEDERAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENTS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each agency shall implement and maintain financial management systems that comply substantially with Federal financial management systems requirements, applicable Federal accounting standards, and the United States Government Standard General Ledger at the transaction level.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Comptroller General shall settle all accounts of the United States Government and supervise the recovery of all debts finally certified by the Comptroller General as due the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A decision of the Comptroller General under section 3529 of this title is conclusive on the Comptroller General when settling the account containing the payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Comptroller General shall settle an account of an accountable official within 3 years after the date the Comptroller General receives the account. A copy of the certificate of settlement shall be provided the official.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:180 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) The settlement of an account is conclusive on the Comptroller General after 3 years after the account is received by the Comptroller General. However, an amount may be charged against the account after the 3-year period when the Government has or may&nbsp;have&nbsp;lost money because the official acted fraudulently or criminally.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A 3-year period under this subsection is suspended during a war.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This subsection does not prohibit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) recovery of public money illegally or erroneously paid;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) recovery from an official of a balance due the Government under a settlement within the 3-year period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) an official from clearing an account of questioned items as prescribed by law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) On settling an account of the Government, the balance certified by the Comptroller General is conclusive on the executive branch of the Government. On the initiative of the Comptroller General or on request of an individual whose accounts are settled or the head of the agency to which the account relates, the Comptroller General may change the account within a year after settlement. The decision of the Comptroller General to change the account is conclusive on the executive branch.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) When an amount of money is expended under law for a treaty or relations with a foreign country, the President may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) authorize the amount to be accounted for each year specifically by settlement of the Comptroller General when the President decides the amount expended may be made public; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) make, or have the Secretary of State make, a certificate of the amount expended if the President decides the amount is not to be accounted for specifically. The certificate is a sufficient voucher for the amount stated in the certificate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Comptroller General shall keep all settled accounts, vouchers, certificates, and related papers until they are disposed of as prescribed by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) This subchapter does not prohibit the Comptroller General from suspending an item in an account to get additional evidence or explanations needed to settle an account.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the Comptroller General may relieve a present or former accountable official or agent of an agency responsible for the physical loss or deficiency of public money, vouchers, checks, securities, or records, or may authorize reimbursement from an appropriation or fund available for the activity in which the loss or deficiency occurred for the amount of the loss or deficiency paid by the official or agent as restitution, when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the head of the agency decides that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the official or agent was carrying out official duties when the loss or deficiency occurred, or the loss or deficiency occurred because of an act or failure to act by a subordinate of the official or agent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the loss or deficiency was not the result of fault or negligence by the official or agent;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the loss or deficiency was not the result of an illegal or incorrect payment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Comptroller General agrees with the decision of the head of the agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Comptroller General shall relieve an official of the armed forces referred to in subsection (a) responsible for the physical loss or deficiency of public money, vouchers, or records, or a payment described in section 3528(a)(4)(A) of this title, or shall authorize reimbursement, from an appropriation or fund available for reimbursement, of the amount of the loss or deficiency paid by or for the official as restitution, when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a physical loss or deficiency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the Secretary of Defense or the appropriate Secretary of the military department of the Department of Defense (or the Secretary of Transportation, in the case of a disbursing official of the Coast Guard when the Coast Guard is not operating as a service in the Navy) decides that the official was carrying out official duties when the loss or deficiency occurred;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the loss or deficiency was not the result of an illegal or incorrect payment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the loss or deficiency was not the result of fault or negligence by the official; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a payment described in section 3528(a)(4)(A) of this title, the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the appropriate military department (or the Secretary of Transportation, in the case of a disbursing official of the Coast Guard when the Coast Guard is not operating as a service in the Navy), after taking a diligent collection action, finds that the criteria of section 3528(b)(1) of this title are satisfied.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The finding of the Secretary involved is conclusive on the Comptroller General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) On the initiative of the Comptroller General or written recommendation of the head of an agency, the Comptroller General may relieve a present or former disbursing official of the agency responsible for a deficiency in an account because of an illegal, improper, or incorrect payment, and credit the account for the deficiency, when the Comptroller General decides that the payment was not the result of bad faith or lack of reasonable care by the official. However, the Comptroller General may deny relief when the Comptroller General decides the head of the agency did not carry out diligently collection action under procedures prescribed by the Comptroller General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) When the Comptroller General decides it is necessary to adjust the account of an official or agent granted relief under subsection (a) or (c) of this section, the amount of the relief shall be charged&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to an appropriation specifically provided to be charged; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if no specific appropriation, to the appropriation or fund available for the expense of the accountable function when the adjustment is carried out.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subsection (c) of this section does not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) affect the liability, or authorize the relief, of a payee, beneficiary, or recipient of an illegal, improper, or incorrect payment; or</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the Comptroller General shall provide for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests under this subchapter. Except as provided under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Comptroller General shall issue a final decision concerning a protest within 100 days after the date the protest is submitted to the Comptroller General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Comptroller General shall, by regulation prescribed pursuant to section 3555 of this title, establish an express option for deciding those protests which the Comptroller General determines suitable for resolution within 65 days after the date the protest is submitted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An amendment to a protest that adds a new ground of protest, if timely made, should be resolved, to the maximum extent practicable, within the time limit established under paragraph (1) of this subsection for final decision of the initial protest. If an amended protest cannot be resolved within such time limit, the Comptroller General may resolve the amended protest through the express option under paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Comptroller General may dismiss a protest that the Comptroller General determines is frivolous or which, on its face, does not state a valid basis for protest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) With respect to a solicitation for a contract, or a proposed award or the award of a contract, protested under this subchapter, the Comptroller General may determine whether the solicitation, proposed award, or award complies with statute and regulation. If the Comptroller General determines that the solicitation, proposed award, or award does not comply with a statute or regulation, the Comptroller General shall recommend that the Federal agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) refrain from exercising any of its options under the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) recompete the contract immediately;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) issue a new solicitation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) terminate the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) award a contract consistent with the requirements of such statute and regulation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) implement any combination of recommendations under clauses (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) implement such other recommendations as the Comptroller General determines to be necessary in order to promote compliance with procurement statutes and regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the head of the procuring activity responsible for a contract makes a finding under section 3553(d)(3)(C)(i)(I) of this title, the Comptroller General shall make recommendations under this subsection without regard to any cost or disruption from terminating, recompeting, or reawarding the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Federal agency fails to implement fully the recommendations of the Comptroller General under this subsection with respect to a solicitation for a contract or an award or proposed award of a contract within 60 days after receiving the recommendations, the head of the <!-- PDFPage:190 -->procuring activity responsible for that contract shall report such failure to the Comptroller General not later than 5 days after the end of such 60-day period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) If the Comptroller General determines that a solicitation for a contract or a proposed award or the award of a contract does not comply with a statute or regulation, the Comptroller General may recommend that the Federal agency conducting the procurement pay to an appropriate interested party the costs of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) filing and pursuing the protest, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and consultant and expert witness fees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) bid and proposal preparation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No party (other than a small business concern (within the meaning of section 3(a) of the Small Business Act)) may be paid, pursuant to a recommendation made under the authority of paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) costs for consultant and expert witness fees that exceed the highest rate of compensation for expert witnesses paid by the Federal Government; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) costs for attorneys&rsquo; fees that exceed $150 per hour unless the agency determines, based on the recommendation of the Comptroller General on a case by case basis, that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Comptroller General recommends under paragraph (1) that a Federal agency pay costs to an interested party, the Federal agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) pay the costs promptly; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the Federal agency does not make such payment, promptly report to the Comptroller General the reasons for the failure to follow the Comptroller General's recommendation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Comptroller General recommends under paragraph (1) that a Federal agency pay costs to an interested party, the Federal agency and the interested party shall attempt to reach an agreement on the amount of the costs to be paid. If the Federal agency and the interested party are unable to agree on the amount to be paid, the Comptroller General may, upon the request of the interested party, recommend to the Federal agency the amount of the costs that the Federal agency should pay.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) After trying to collect a claim from a person under section 3711(a) of this title, the head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency may collect the claim by administrative offset. The head of the agency may collect by administrative offset only after giving the debtor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) written notice of the type and amount of the claim, the intention of the head of the agency to collect the claim by administrative offset, and an explanation of the rights of the debtor under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an opportunity to inspect and copy the records of the agency related to the claim;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an opportunity for a review within the agency of the decision of the agency related to the claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) an opportunity to make a written agreement with the head of the agency to repay the amount of the claim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Before collecting a claim by administrative offset, the head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency must either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) adopt, without change, regulations on collecting by administrative offset promulgated by the Department of Justice, the General Accounting Office, or the Department of the Treasury; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) prescribe regulations on collecting by administrative offset consistent with the regulations referred to in paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1)(A) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a disbursing official of the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Defense, the United States Postal Service, or any other government corporation, or any disbursing official of the United States designated by the Secretary of the Treasury, shall offset at least annually the amount of a payment which a payment certifying agency has certified to the disbursing official for disbursement, by an amount equal to the amount of a claim which a creditor agency has certified to the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An agency that designates disbursing officials pursuant to section 3321(c) of this title is not required to certify claims arising out of its operations to the Secretary of the Treasury before such agency's disbursing officials offset such claims.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Payments certified by the Department of Education under a program administered by the Secretary of Education under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 shall not be subject to administrative offset under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Neither the disbursing official nor the payment certifying agency shall be liable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for the amount of the administrative offset on the basis that the underlying obligation, represented by the payment before the administrative offset was taken, was not satisfied; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for failure to provide timely notice under paragraph (8).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law (including sections 207 and 1631(d)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 407 and 1383(d)(1)), section 413(b) of Public Law 91&ndash;173 (30 U.S.C. 923(b)), and section 14 of the Act of August 29, 1935 (45 U.S.C. 231m)), except as provided in clause (ii), all payments due to an individual under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the Social Security Act,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) any law administered by the Railroad Retirement Board (other than payments that such Board determines to be tier 2 benefits),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be subject to offset under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) An amount of $9,000 which a debtor may receive under Federal benefit programs cited under clause (i) within a 12-month period shall be exempt from offset under this subsection. In applying the $9,000 exemption, the disbursing official shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) reduce the $9,000 exemption amount for the 12-month period by the amount of all Federal benefit payments made during such 12-month period which are not subject to offset under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) apply a prorated amount of the exemption to each periodic benefit payment to be made to the debtor during the applicable 12-month period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the amount of a periodic benefit payment shall be the amount after any reduction or deduction required under the laws authorizing the program under which such payment is authorized to be made (including any reduction or deduction to recover any overpayment under such program).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary of the Treasury shall exempt from administrative offset under this subsection payments under means-tested programs when requested by the head of the respective agency. The Secretary may exempt other payments from administrative offset under this subsection upon the written request of the head of a payment certifying agency. A written request for exemption of other payments must provide justification for the exemption under standards prescribed by the Secretary. Such standards shall give due consideration to whether administrative offset would tend to interfere substantially with or defeat the purposes of the payment certifying agency's program. The Secretary shall report to the Congress annually on exemptions granted under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The provisions of sections 205(b)(1) and 1631(c)(1) of the Social Security Act shall not apply to any administrative offset executed pursuant to this section against benefits authorized by either title II or title XVI of the Social Security Act, respectively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of the Treasury may charge a fee sufficient to cover the full cost of implementing this subsection. The fee may be col<!-- PDFPage:205 -->lected either by the retention of a portion of amounts collected pursuant to this subsection, or by billing the agency referring or transferring a claim for those amounts. Fees charged to the agencies shall be based on actual administrative offsets completed. Amounts received by the United States as fees under this subsection shall be deposited into the account of the Department of the Treasury under section 3711(g)(7) of this title, and shall be collected and accounted for in accordance with the provisions of that section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Commissioner of Social Security and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, may prescribe such rules, regulations, and procedures as the Secretary of the Treasury considers necessary to carry out this subsection. The Secretary shall consult with the heads of affected agencies in the development of such rules, regulations, and procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any Federal agency that is owed by a person a past due, legally enforceable nontax debt that is over 180 days delinquent, including nontax debt administered by a third party acting as an agent for the Federal Government, shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of all such nontax debts for purposes of administrative offset under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) The disbursing official conducting an administrative offset with respect to a payment to a payee shall notify the payee in writing of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the occurrence of the administrative offset to satisfy a past due legally enforceable debt, including a description of the type and amount of the payment otherwise payable to the payee against which the offset was executed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the identity of the creditor agency requesting the offset; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) a contact point within the creditor agency that will handle concerns regarding the offset.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the payment to be offset is a periodic benefit payment, the disbursing official shall take reasonable steps, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, to provide the notice to the payee not later than the date on which the payee is otherwise scheduled to receive the payment, or as soon as practical thereafter, but no later than the date of the administrative offset. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the failure of the debtor to receive such notice shall not impair the legality of such administrative offset.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall take precedence over requests for administrative offset pursuant to other laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the use of any other administrative offset authority existing under statute or common law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) This section does not apply&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to a claim under this subchapter that has been outstanding for more than 10 years; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) when a statute explicitly prohibits using administrative offset or setoff to collect the claim or type of claim involved.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary may waive the requirements of sections 552a(<em>o</em>) and (p) of title 5 for administrative offset or claims collection upon written certification by the head of a State or an executive, judicial, or legislative agency seeking to collect the claim that the requirements of subsection (a) of this section have been met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Data Integrity Board of the Department of the Treasury established under 552a(u) of title 5 shall review and include in reports under paragraph (3)(D) of that section a description of any matching activities conducted under this section. If the Secretary has granted a waiver under subsection (f) of this section, no other Data Integrity Board is required to take any action under section 552a(u) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) The Secretary may, in the discretion of the Secretary, apply subsection (a) with respect to any past-due, legally-enforceable debt owed to a State if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the appropriate State disbursing official requests that an offset be performed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a reciprocal agreement with the State is in effect which contains, at a minimum&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) requirements substantially equivalent to subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) any other requirements which the Secretary considers appropriate to facilitate the offset and prevent duplicative efforts.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This subsection does not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the collection of a debt or claim on which the administrative costs associated with the collection of the debt or claim exceed the amount of the debt or claim;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any collection of any other type, class, or amount of claim, as the Secretary considers necessary to protect the interest of the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the disbursement of any class or type of payment exempted by the Secretary of the Treasury at the request of a Federal agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In applying this section with respect to any debt owed to a State, subsection (c)(3)(A) shall not apply.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13019, Sept. 28, 1996, 61 F.R. 51763, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, Public Law 104&ndash;134 [&sect;31001] (110 Stat. 1321&ndash;358 <em>et seq</em>.) [see Short Title of 1996 Amendment note set out under section 3701 of this title], was enacted into law on April 26, 1996, as part of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996. While the primary purpose of the Debt Collection Improvement Act is to increase the collection of nontax debts owed to the Federal Government, the Act also contains important provisions that can be used to assist families in collecting past-due child support obligations.</p>
<p class="note-body">The failure of some parents to meet their child support obligations threatens the health, education, and well-being of their children. Compounding this problem, States have experienced difficulties enforcing child support obligations once a parent has moved to another State. With this Executive order, my Administration takes additional steps to support our children and strengthen American families by facilitating the collection of delinquent child support obligations from persons who may be entitled or eligible to receive certain Federal payments or Federal assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Administrative Offsets</em>. (a)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury (&ldquo;the Secretary&rdquo;), in accordance with the provisions of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 and to the extent permitted by law, and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and other affected agencies, shall promptly develop and implement procedures necessary for the Secretary to collect past-due child support debts by administrative offset, and shall issue such rules, regulations, and procedures as the Secretary, in consultation with the heads of affected agencies, deems appropriate to govern administrative offsets by the Department of the Treasury and other executive departments and agencies that disburse Federal payments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The Secretary may enter into reciprocal agreements with States concerning the collection by the Secretary of delinquent child support debts through administrative offsets.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, within 120 days of the date of this order, implement procedures necessary to report to the Secretary of the Treasury information on past-due child support claims referred by States (including claims enforced by States pursuant to cooperative agreements with or by Indian tribal governments) to the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The head of each executive department and agency that certifies payments to the Secretary or to another disbursing official shall review each class of payments that the department or agency certifies to determine if any such class should be exempt from offset and, if any class is so identified, submit to the Secretary a request for such an exemption together with the reasons therefor. With respect to classes of payments under means-tested programs existing on the date of this order, such submission shall be made within 30 days of the date of this order. With respect to classes of payments other than payments under means-tested programs existing on the date of this order, such submissions shall be made within 30 days of the date the Secretary establishes standards pursuant to section 3716(c)(3) of title 31, United States Code. With respect to a class of payments established after the date of this order, such submissions shall be made not later than 30 days after such class is established.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The head of each executive department and agency that certifies payments to the Secretary shall promptly implement any rule, regulation, or procedure issued by the Secretary pursuant to this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The head of each executive department and agency that is authorized by law to disburse payments shall promptly implement any rule, regulation, or procedure issued by the Secretary pursuant to this section and shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) match, consistent with computer privacy matching laws, the payment certification records of such de<!-- PDFPage:207 -->partment or agency with records of persons delinquent in child support payments as directed by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) conduct administrative offsets to collect delinquent child support payments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) The Secretary shall, to the extent permitted by law, share with the Secretary of Health and Human Services any information contained in payment certification records of persons who are delinquent in child support obligations that would assist in the collection of such debts, whether or not an administrative offset is conducted.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Denial of Federal Assistance</em>. (a) The Secretary shall, to the extent permitted by law, ensure that information concerning individuals whose payments are subject to administrative offset because of delinquent child support obligations is made available to the head of each executive department and agency that provides Federal financial assistance to individuals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In conformance with section 2(e) of this order, the head of each executive department and agency shall, with respect to any individuals whose payments are subject to administrative offset because of a delinquent child support obligation, promptly implement procedures to deny Federal financial assistance to such individuals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and other affected agencies, shall promptly issue guidelines for departments and agencies concerning minimum due-process standards to be included in the procedures required by subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) For purposes of this section, Federal financial assistance means any Federal loan (other than a disaster loan), loan guarantee, or loan insurance.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e)(1) A class of Federal financial assistance shall not be subject to denial if the head of the concerned department or agency determines:</p>
<p class="note-body">(A) in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, that such action:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) is not permitted by law; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) would likely result in valid legal claims for damages against the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body">(B) that such action would be inconsistent with the best interests of the child or children with respect to whom a child support obligation is owed; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(C) that such action should be waived.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The head of each executive department and agency shall provide written notification to the Secretary upon determining that the denial of a class of Federal financial assistance is not permitted by law or should be waived.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) The head of each executive department and agency shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) review all laws under the jurisdiction of the department or agency that do not permit the denial of Federal financial assistance to individuals and whose payments are subject to administrative offset because of a delinquent child support obligation and, where appropriate, transmit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget recommendations for statutory changes; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) to the extent practicable, review all rules, regulations, and procedures implementing laws under the jurisdiction of the department or agency governing the provision of any Federal financial assistance to individuals and, where appropriate, conform such rules, regulations, and procedures to the provisions of this order and the rules, regulations, and procedures issued by the Secretary pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Reports</em>.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under conditions the head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency considers appropriate, the head of the agency may enter into a contract with a person for collection service to recover indebtedness owed, or to locate or recover assets of, the United States Government. The head of an agency may not enter into a contract under the preceding sentence to locate or recover assets of the United States held by a State government or financial institution unless that agency has established procedures approved by the Secretary of the Treasury to identify and recover such assets. The contract shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the head of the agency retains the authority to resolve a dispute, compromise a claim, end collection action, and refer a matter to the Attorney General to bring a civil action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the person is subject to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) section 552a of title 5, to the extent provided in section 552a(m); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) laws and regulations of the United States Government and State governments related to debt collection practices.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1)(A) The Attorney General may make contracts retaining private counsel to furnish legal services, including representation in negotiation, compromise, settlement, and litigation, in the case of any claim of indebtedness owed the United States. Each such contract shall include such terms and conditions as the Attorney Gen<!-- PDFPage:209 -->eral considers necessary and appropriate, including a provision specifying the amount of the fee to be paid to the private counsel under such contract or the method for calculating that fee. The amount of the fee payable for legal services furnished under any such contract may not exceed the fee that counsel engaged in the private practice of law in the area or areas where the legal services are furnished typically charge clients for furnishing legal services in the collection of claims of indebtedness, as determined by the Attorney General, considering the amount, age, and nature of the indebtedness and whether the debtor is an individual or a business entity. Nothing in this subparagraph shall relieve the Attorney General of the competition requirements set forth in title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 and following).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Attorney General shall use his best efforts to enter into contracts under this paragraph with law firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and law firms that are qualified HUBZone small business concerns (as defined in section 3(p) of the Small Business Act), so as to enable each agency to comply with paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency may, subject to the approval of the Attorney General, refer to a private counsel retained under paragraph (1) of this subsection claims of indebtedness owed the United States arising out of activities of that agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each agency shall use its best efforts to assure that not less than 10 percent of the amounts of all claims referred to private counsel by that agency under paragraph (2) are referred to law firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and law firms that are qualified HUBZone small business concerns. For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the term &ldquo;law firm owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals&rdquo; means a law firm that meets the requirements set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of section 8(d)(3)(C) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(3)(C)(i) and (ii)) and regulations issued under those clauses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) &ldquo;socially and economically disadvantaged individuals&rdquo; shall be presumed to include these groups and individuals described in the last paragraph of section 8(d)(3)(C) of the Small Business Act; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the term &ldquo;qualified HUBZone small business concern&rdquo; has the meaning given that term in section 3(p) of the Small Business Act.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding sections 516, 518(b), 519, and 547(2) of title 28, a private counsel retained under paragraph (1) of this subsection may represent the United States in litigation in connection with legal services furnished pursuant to the contract entered into with that counsel under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A contract made with a private counsel under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a provision permitting the Attorney General to terminate either the contract or the private counsel's representation of the United States in particular cases if the Attorney General finds that such action is for the convenience of the Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a provision stating that the head of the executive or&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3718_1_target" name="3718_1">1</a></sup> legislative agency which refers a claim under the contract retains the authority to resolve a dispute regarding the claim, to compromise the claim, or to terminate a collection action on the claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a provision requiring the private counsel to transmit monthly to the Attorney General and the head of the executive or&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3718_1_target" name="3718_1">1</a></sup> legislative agency referring a claim under the contract a report on the services relating to the claim rendered under the contract during the month and the progress made during the month in collecting the claim under the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Notwithstanding the fourth sentence of section 803(6) of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 1692a(6)), a private counsel performing legal services pursuant to a contract made under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be considered to be a debt collector for the purposes of such Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Any counterclaim filed in any action to recover indebtedness owed the United States which is brought on behalf of the United States by private counsel retained under this subsection may not be asserted unless the counterclaim is served directly on the Attorney General or the United States Attorney for the judicial district in which, or embracing the place in which, the action is brought. Such service shall be made in accordance with the rules of procedure of the court in which the action is brought.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Attorney General shall transmit to the Congress an annual report on the activities of the Department of Justice to recover indebtedness owed the United States which was referred to the Department of Justice for collection. Each such report shall include a list, by agency, of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the total number and amounts of claims which were referred for legal services to the Department of Justice and to private counsel under subsection (b) during the 1-year period covered by the report;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the total number and amount of those claims referred for legal services to the Department of Justice which were collected or were not collected or otherwise resolved during the 1-year period covered by the report; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the total number and amount of those claims referred for legal services to private counsel under subsection (b)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which were collected or were not collected or otherwise resolved during the 1-year period covered by the report;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which were not collected or otherwise resolved under a contract terminated by the Attorney General during the 1-year period covered by the report; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) on which the Attorney General terminated the private counsel's representation during the 1-year period covered by the report without terminating the contract with the private counsel under which the claims were referred.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:210 --><p class="statutory-body">(d) Notwithstanding section 3302(b) of this title, a contract under subsection (a) or (b) of this section may provide that a fee a person charges to recover indebtedness owed, or to locate or recover assets of, the United States Government is payable from the amount recovered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A contract under subsection (a) or (b) of this section is effective only to the extent and in the amount provided in an appropriation law. This limitation does not apply in the case of a contract that authorizes a person to collect a fee as provided in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) This section does not apply to the collection of debts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) In order to assist Congress in determining whether use of private counsel is a cost-effective method of collecting Government debts, the Attorney General shall, following consultation with the General Accounting Office, maintain and make available to the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, statistical data relating to the comparative costs of debt collection by participating United States Attorneys&rsquo; Offices and by private counsel.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:217 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;agency&rdquo; does not include a nonappropriated fund activity or a contractor with the United States Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;head of an agency&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for a military department, the Secretary of the military department;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for the Department of Defense (except the military departments), the Secretary of Defense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) for another agency, the head of the agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) &ldquo;settle&rdquo; means consider, determine, adjust, and dispose of a claim by disallowance or by complete or partial allowance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The head of an agency may settle and pay not more than $40,000 for a claim against the Government made by a member of the uniformed services under the jurisdiction of the agency or by an officer or employee of the agency for damage to, or loss of, personal property incident to service. If, however, the claim arose from an emergency evacuation or from extraordinary circumstances, the amount settled and paid under the authority of the preceding sentence may exceed $40,000, but may not exceed $100,000. A claim allowed under this subsection may be paid in money or the personal property replaced in kind.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of State may waive the settlement and payment limitation referred to in paragraph (1) for claims for damage or loss by United States Government personnel under the jurisdiction of a chief of mission in a foreign country if such claims arise in circumstances where there is in effect a departure from the country authorized or ordered under circumstances described in section 5522(a) of title 5, if the Secretary determines that there exists exceptional circumstances that warrant such a waiver.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) On paying a claim under this section, the Government is subrogated for the amount of the payment to a right or claim that the claimant may have against a foreign country for the damage or loss for which the Government made the payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Mayor of the District of Columbia may settle and pay a claim against the District of Columbia government made by an officer or employee of the District of Columbia government to the same extent the head of an agency may settle and pay a claim under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A claim may not be allowed under this section if the personal property damage or loss occurred at quarters occupied by the claimant in a State or the District of Columbia that were not assigned or provided in kind by the United States Government or the District of Columbia government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) A claim may be allowed under this section only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the claim is substantiated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the head of the agency decides that possession of the property was reasonable or useful under the circumstances; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) no part of the loss was caused by any negligent or wrongful act of the claimant or an agent or employee of the claimant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) A claim may be allowed under this section only if it is presented in writing within 2 years after the claim accrues. However, if a claim under subsection (b) of this section accrues during war or an armed conflict in which an armed force of the United States is involved, or has accrued within 2 years before war or an armed conflict begins, and for cause shown, the claim must be presented within 2 years after the cause no longer exists or after the war or armed conflict ends, whichever is earlier. An armed conflict begins and ends as stated in a concurrent resolution of Congress or a decision of the President.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The head of the agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may settle and pay a claim made by the surviving spouse, child, parent, or brother or sister of a dead member, officer, or employee if the claim is otherwise payable under this section; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the spouse's claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a child's claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a parent's claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a brother's or sister's claim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Notwithstanding a contract, the representative of a claimant may not receive more than 10 percent of a payment of a claim made under this section for services related to the claim. A person violating this subsection shall be fined not more than $1,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) The President may prescribe policies to carry out this section (except subsection (b) to the extent that subsection (b) applies to the military departments, the Department of Defense, and the Coast Guard). Subject to those policies, the head of each agency shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) Settlement of a claim under this section is final and conclusive.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the authorization to receive payment for any part of the claim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) An assignment may be made only after a claim is allowed, the amount of the claim is decided, and a warrant for payment of the claim has been issued. The assignment shall specify the warrant, must be made freely, and must be attested to by 2 witnesses. The person making the assignment shall acknowledge it before an official who may acknowledge a deed, and the <!-- PDFPage:224 -->official shall certify the assignment. The certificate shall state that the official completely explained the assignment when it was acknowledged. An assignment under this subsection is valid for any purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply to an assignment to a financing institution of money due or to become due under a contract providing for payments totaling at least $1,000 when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the contract does not forbid an assignment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) unless the contract expressly provides otherwise, the assignment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is for the entire amount not already paid;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is made to only one party, except that it may be made to a party as agent or trustee for more than one party participating in the financing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may not be reassigned; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the assignee files a written notice of the assignment and a copy of the assignment with the contracting official or the head of the agency, the surety on a bond on the contract, and any disbursing official for the contract.</p>

A payment subsequently due under the contract (even after the war or emergency is ended) shall be paid to the assignee without a reduction or setoff for liability of the assignor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to the Government independent of the contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) because of renegotiation, fine, penalty (except an amount that may be collected or withheld under, or because the assignor does not comply with, the contract), taxes, social security contributions, or withholding or failing to withhold taxes or social security contributions, arising from, or independent of, the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) An assignee under this section does not have to make restitution of, refund, or repay the amount received because of the liability of the assignor to the Government that arises from or is independent of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Government may not collect or reclaim money paid to a person receiving an amount under an assignment or allotment of pay or allowances authorized by law when liability may exist because of the death of the person making the assignment or allotment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses shall be served on the Government pursuant to Rule 4(d)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The complaint shall be filed in camera, shall remain under seal for at least 60 days, and shall not be served on the defendant until the court so orders.

Any such motions may be supported by affidavits or other submissions in camera. The defendant shall not be required to respond to any complaint filed under this section until 20 days after the complaint is unsealed and served upon the defendant pursuant to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Before the expiration of the 60-day period or any extensions obtained under paragraph (3), the Government shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) proceed with the action, in which case the action shall be conducted by the Government; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) limiting the number of witnesses the person may call;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Upon a showing by the defendant that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would be for purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense, the court may limit the participation by the person in the litigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Government elects not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action shall have the right to conduct the action. If the Government so requests, it shall be served with copies of all pleadings filed in the action and shall be supplied with copies of all deposition transcripts (at the Government's expense). When a person proceeds with the action, the court, without limiting the status and rights of the person initiating the action, may nevertheless permit the Government to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Whether or not the Government proceeds with the action, upon a showing by the Government that certain actions of discovery by the person initiating the action would interfere with the Government's investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts, the court may stay such discovery for a period of not more than 60 days. Such a <!-- PDFPage:228 -->showing shall be conducted in camera. The court may extend the 60-day period upon a further showing in camera that the Government has pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the civil action will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the Government may elect to pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to the Government, including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil money penalty. If any such alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding, the person initiating the action shall have the same rights in such proceeding as such person would have had if the action had continued under this section. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court of the United States, if all time for filing such an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Award to Qui Tam Plaintiff</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Government proceeds with an action brought by a person under subsection (b), such person shall, subject to the second sentence of this paragraph, receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, depending upon the extent to which the person substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action. Where the action is one which the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information (other than information provided by the person bringing the action) relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3730_1_target" name="3730_1">1</a></sup> Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation. Any payment to a person under the first or second sentence of this paragraph shall be made from the proceeds. Any such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Government does not proceed with an action under this section, the person bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. The amount shall be not less than 25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of such proceeds. Such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whether or not the Government proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a person who planned and initiated the violation of section 3729 upon which the action was brought, then the court may, to the extent the court considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action which the person would otherwise receive under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, taking into account the role of that person in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation. If the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of section 3729, that person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action. Such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the United States to continue the action, represented by the Department of Justice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Government does not proceed with the action and the person bringing the action conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim of the person bringing the action was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Certain Actions Barred</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought by a former or present member of the armed forces under subsection (b) of this section against a member of the armed forces arising out of such person's service in the armed forces.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought under subsection (b) against a Member of Congress, a member of the judiciary, or a senior executive branch official if the action is based on evidence or information known to the Government when the action was brought.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, &ldquo;senior executive branch official&rdquo; means any officer or employee listed in paragraphs (1) through (8) of section 101(f) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In no event may a person bring an action under subsection (b) which is based upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding in which the Government is already a party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3730_2_target" name="3730_2">2</a></sup> Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, &ldquo;original source&rdquo; means an individual who has direct and <!-- PDFPage:229 -->independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the Government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Government Not Liable for Certain Expenses</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Government is not liable for expenses which a person incurs in bringing an action under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Fees and Expenses to Prevailing Defendant</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In civil actions brought under this section by the United States, the provisions of section 2412(d) of title 28 shall apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Any employee who is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment by his or her employer because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others in furtherance of an action under this section, including investigation for, initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this section, shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole. Such relief shall include reinstatement with the same seniority status such employee would have had but for the discrimination, 2 times the amount of back pay, interest on the back pay, and compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees. An employee may bring an action in the appropriate district court of the United States for the relief provided in this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Issuance and service</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever the Attorney General has reason to believe that any person may be in possession, custody, or control of any documentary material or information relevant to a false claims law investigation, the Attorney General may, before commencing a civil proceeding under section 3730 or other false claims law, issue in writing and cause to be served upon such person, a civil investigative demand requiring such person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to produce such documentary material for inspection and copying,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to answer in writing written interrogatories with respect to such documentary material or information,</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Attorney General may not delegate the authority to issue civil investigative demands under this subsection.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Contents and deadlines.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Each civil investigative demand issued under paragraph (1) shall state the nature of the conduct constituting the alleged violation of a false claims law which is under investigation, and the applicable provision of law alleged to be violated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) prescribe a return date for each such class which will provide a reasonable period of time within which the material so demanded may be assembled and made available for inspection and copying; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) identify the false claims law investigator to whom such material shall be made available.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) If such demand is for answers to written interrogatories, the demand shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) set forth with specificity the written interrogatories to be answered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) prescribe dates at which time answers to written interrogatories shall be submitted; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) If such demand is for the giving of oral testimony, the demand shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) prescribe a date, time, and place at which oral testimony shall be commenced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) identify a false claims law investigator who shall conduct the examination and the custodian to whom the transcript of such examination shall be submitted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) specify that such attendance and testimony are necessary to the conduct of the investigation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) notify the person receiving the demand of the right to be accompanied by an attorney and any other representative; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) describe the general purpose for which the demand is being issued and the general nature of the testimony, including the primary areas of inquiry, which will be taken pursuant to the demand.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Any civil investigative demand issued under this section which is an express demand for any product of discovery shall not be returned or returnable until 20 days after a copy of such demand has been served upon the person from whom the discovery was obtained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) The date prescribed for the commencement of oral testimony pursuant to a civil investigative demand issued under this section shall be a date which is not less than seven days after the date on which demand is received, unless the Attorney General or an Assistant Attorney General designated by the Attorney General determines that exceptional circumstances are present which warrant the commencement of such testimony within a lesser period of time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) The Attorney General shall not authorize the issuance under this section of more than one civil investigative demand for oral testimony by the same person unless the person requests otherwise or unless the Attorney General, after investigation, notifies that person in writing that an additional demand for oral testimony is necessary. The Attorney General may not, notwithstanding section 510 of title 28, authorize the performance, by any other officer, employee, or agency, of any function vested in the Attorney General under this subparagraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A civil investigative demand issued under subsection (a) may not require the production of any documentary material, the submission of any answers to written interrogatories, or the giving of any oral testimony if such material, answers, or testimony would be protected from disclosure under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the standards applicable to subpoenas or subpoenas duces tecum issued by a court of the United States to aid in a grand jury investigation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the standards applicable to discovery requests under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to the extent that the application of such standards to any such demand is <!-- PDFPage:232 -->appropriate and consistent with the provisions and purposes of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Effect on other orders, rules, and laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any such demand which is an express demand for any product of discovery supersedes any inconsistent order, rule, or provision of law (other than this section) preventing or restraining disclosure of such product of discovery to any person. Disclosure of any product of discovery pursuant to any such express demand does not constitute a waiver of any right or privilege which the person making such disclosure may be entitled to invoke to resist discovery of trial preparation materials.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Service; Jurisdiction.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Service in foreign countries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any such demand or any petition filed under subsection (j) may be served upon any person who is not found within the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States in such manner as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure prescribe for service in a foreign country. To the extent that the courts of the United States can assert jurisdiction over any such person consistent with due process, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have the same jurisdiction to take any action respecting compliance with this section by any such person that such court would have if such person were personally within the jurisdiction of such court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Service Upon Legal Entities and Natural Persons.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Proof of Service</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A verified return by the individual serving any civil investigative demand issued under subsection (a) or any petition filed under subsection (j) setting forth the manner of such service shall be proof of such service. In the case of service by registered or certified mail, such return shall be accompanied by the return post office receipt of delivery of such demand.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The examination of any person pursuant to a civil investigative demand for oral testimony served under this section shall be taken before an officer authorized to administer oaths and affirmations by the laws of the United States or of the place where the examination is held. The officer before whom the testimony is to be taken shall put the witness on oath or affirmation and shall, personally or by someone acting under the direction of the officer and in the officer's presence, record the testimony of the witness. The testimony shall be taken stenographically and shall be transcribed. When the testimony is fully transcribed, the officer before whom the testimony is taken shall promptly transmit a copy of the transcript of the testimony to the custodian. This subsection shall not preclude the taking of testimony by any means authorized by, and in a manner consistent with, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Persons present</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The false claims law investigator conducting the examination shall exclude from the place where the examination is held all persons except the person giving the testimony, the attorney for and any other representative of the person giving the testimony, the attorney for the Government, any person who may be agreed upon by the attorney for the Government and the person giving the testimony, the officer before whom the testimony is to be taken, and any stenographer taking such testimony.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Transcript of testimony</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the testimony is fully transcribed, the false claims law investigator or the officer before whom the testimony is taken shall afford the witness, who may be accompanied by counsel, a reasonable opportunity to examine and read the transcript, unless such examination and reading are waived by the witness. Any changes in form or substance which the witness desires to make shall be entered and identified upon the transcript by the officer or the false claims law investigator, with a statement of the reasons given by the witness for making such changes. The transcript shall then be signed by the witness, unless the witness in writing waives the signing, is ill, cannot be found, or refuses to sign. If the transcript is not signed by the witness within 30 days after being afforded a reasonable opportunity to examine it, the officer or the false claims law investigator shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver, illness, absence of the witness, or the refusal to sign, together with the reasons, if any, given therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Certification and delivery to custodian</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The officer before whom the testimony is taken shall certify on the transcript that the witness was sworn by the officer and that the transcript is a true record of the testimony given by the witness, and the officer or false claims law investigator shall promptly deliver the transcript, or send the transcript by registered or certified mail, to the custodian.</p>

Counsel may advise such person, in confidence, with respect to any question asked of such person. Such person or counsel may object on the record to any question, in whole or in part, and shall briefly state for the record the reason for the objection. An objection may be made, received, and entered upon the record when it is claimed that such person is entitled to refuse to answer the question on the grounds of any constitutional or other legal right or privilege, including the privilege against self-incrimination. Such person may not otherwise object to or refuse to answer any question, and may not directly or through counsel otherwise interrupt the oral examination. If such person refuses to answer any question, a petition may be filed in the district court of the United States under subsection (j)(1) for an order compelling such person to answer such question.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If such person refuses to answer any question on the grounds of the privilege against self-incrimination, the testimony of such person may be compelled in accordance with the provisions of part V of title 18.</p>

Upon the completion of any such case or proceeding, such attorney shall return to the custodian any such material, answers, or transcripts so delivered which have not passed into the control of such court, grand jury, or agency through introduction into the record of such case or proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Conditions for return of material</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If any documentary material has been produced by any person in the course of any false claims law investigation pursuant to a civil investigative demand under this section, and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any case or proceeding before the court or grand jury arising out of such investigation, or any proceeding before any Federal agency involving such material, has been completed, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) no case or proceeding in which such material may be used has been commenced within a reasonable time after completion of the examination and analysis of all documentary material and other information assembled in the course of such investigation,</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Appointment of successor custodians</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the event of the death, disability, or separation from service in the Department of Justice of the custodian of any documentary material, answers to interrogatories, or transcripts of oral testimony produced pursuant to a civil investigative demand under this section, or in the event of the official relief of such custodian from responsibility for the custody and control of such material, answers, or transcripts, the Attorney General shall promptly&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) designate another false claims law investigator to serve as custodian of such material, answers, or transcripts, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) transmit in writing to the person who produced such material, answers, or testimony notice of the identity and address of the successor so designated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Any person who is designated to be a successor under this paragraph shall have, with regard to such material, answers, or transcripts, the same duties and responsibilities as were imposed by this section upon that person's predecessor in office, except that the successor shall not be held responsible for any default or dereliction which occurred before that designation.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3902. Interest penalties</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under regulations prescribed under section 3903 of this title, the head of an agency acquiring property or service from a business concern, who does not pay the concern for each complete delivered item of property or service by the required payment date, shall pay an interest penalty to the concern on the amount of the payment due. The interest shall be computed at the rate of interest established by the Secretary of the Treasury, and published in the Federal Register, for interest payments under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611), which is in effect at the time the agency accrues the obligation to pay a late payment interest penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The interest penalty shall be paid for the period beginning on the day after the required payment date and ending on the date on which payment is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A business concern shall be entitled to an interest penalty of $1.00 or more which is owed such business concern under this section, and such penalty shall be paid without regard to whether the business concern has requested payment of such penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each payment subject to this chapter for which a late payment interest penalty is required to be paid shall be accompanied by a no<!-- PDFPage:247 -->tice stating the amount of the interest penalty included in such payment and the rate by which, and period for which, such penalty was computed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a business concern&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is owed an interest penalty by an agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is not paid the interest penalty in a payment made to the business concern by the agency on or after the date on which the interest penalty becomes due;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is not paid the interest penalty by the agency within 10 days after the date on which such payment is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) makes a written demand, not later than 40 days after the date on which such payment is made, that the agency pay such a penalty,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">such business concern shall be entitled to an amount equal to the sum of the late payment interest penalty to which the contractor is entitled and an additional penalty equal to a percentage of such late payment interest penalty specified by regulation by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, subject to such maximum as may be specified in such regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The temporary unavailability of funds to make a timely payment due for property or services does not relieve the head of an agency from the obligation to pay interest penalties under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) An amount of an interest penalty unpaid after any 30-day period shall be added to the principal amount of the debt, and a penalty accrues thereafter on the added amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) This section does not authorize the appropriation of additional amounts to pay an interest penalty. The head of an agency shall pay a penalty under this section out of amounts made available to carry out the program for which the penalty is incurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) A recipient of a grant from the head of an agency may provide in a contract for the acquisition of property or service from a business concern that, consistent with the usual business practices of the recipient and applicable State and local law, the recipient will pay an interest penalty on amounts overdue under the contract under conditions agreed to by the recipient and the concern. The recipient may not pay the penalty from amounts received from an agency. Amounts expended for the penalty may not be counted toward a matching requirement applicable to the grant. An obligation to pay the penalty is not an obligation of the United States Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) This section shall apply to contracts for the procurement of property or services entered into pursuant to section 4(h) of the Act of June 29, 1948 (15 U.S.C. 714b(h)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the case of a payment to which producers on a farm are entitled under the terms of an agreement entered into under the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.), an interest penalty shall be paid to the producers if the payment has not been made by the required payment or loan closing date. The interest penalty shall be paid&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) on the amount of payment or loan due; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for the period beginning on the first day beginning after the required payment or loan closing date and ending on the date the amount is paid or loaned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) As used in this subsection, the &ldquo;required payment or loan closing date&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) for a purchase agreement, the 30th day after delivery of the warehouse receipt for the commodity subject to the purchase agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for a loan agreement, the 30th day beginning after the date of receipt of an application with all requisite documentation and signatures, unless the applicant requests that the disbursement be deferred;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) for refund of amounts received greater than the amount required to repay a commodity loan, the first business day after the Commodity Credit Corporation receives payment for such loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) for land diversion payments (other than advance payments), the 30th day beginning after the date of completion of the production adjustment contract by the producer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) for an advance land diversion payment, 30 days after the date the Commodity Credit Corporation executes the contract with the producer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) for a deficiency payment (other than advance payments) based upon a 12-month or 5-month period, 91 days after the end of such period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) for an advance deficiency payment, 30 days after the date the Commodity Credit Corporation executes the contract with the producer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Payment of the interest penalty under this subsection shall be made out of funds available under section 8 of the Act of June 29, 1948 (15 U.S.C. 714f).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Section 3907 of this title shall not apply to interest penalty payments made under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) A claim for an interest penalty not paid under this chapter may be filed under section 6 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 605).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) An interest penalty under this chapter does not continue to accrue&mdash;</p>

A penalty accruing under section 12 may accrue on an unpaid contract payment and on the unpaid penalty under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Except as provided in section 3904 of this title, this chapter does not require an interest penalty on a payment that is not made because of a dispute between the head of an agency and a business concern over the amount of payment or compliance with the contract.
