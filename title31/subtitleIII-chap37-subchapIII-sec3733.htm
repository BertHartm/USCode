<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Issuance and service</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever the Attorney General has reason to believe that any person may be in possession, custody, or control of any documentary material or information relevant to a false claims law investigation, the Attorney General may, before commencing a civil proceeding under section 3730 or other false claims law, issue in writing and cause to be served upon such person, a civil investigative demand requiring such person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to produce such documentary material for inspection and copying,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to answer in writing written interrogatories with respect to such documentary material or information,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to give oral testimony concerning such documentary material or information, or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Attorney General may not delegate the authority to issue civil investigative demands under this subsection. Whenever a civil investigative demand is an express demand for any product of discovery, the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, or an Assistant Attorney General shall cause to be served, in any manner authorized by this section, a copy of such demand upon the person from whom the discovery was obtained and shall notify the person to whom such demand is issued of the date on which such copy was served.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Contents and deadlines.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Each civil investigative demand issued under paragraph (1) shall state the nature of the conduct constituting the alleged violation of a false claims law which is under investigation, and the applicable provision of law alleged to be violated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) prescribe a return date for each such class which will provide a reasonable period of time within which the material so demanded may be assembled and made available for inspection and copying; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) identify the false claims law investigator to whom such material shall be made available.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) If such demand is for answers to written interrogatories, the demand shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) set forth with specificity the written interrogatories to be answered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) prescribe dates at which time answers to written interrogatories shall be submitted; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) If such demand is for the giving of oral testimony, the demand shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) prescribe a date, time, and place at which oral testimony shall be commenced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) identify a false claims law investigator who shall conduct the examination and the custodian to whom the transcript of such examination shall be submitted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) specify that such attendance and testimony are necessary to the conduct of the investigation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) notify the person receiving the demand of the right to be accompanied by an attorney and any other representative; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) describe the general purpose for which the demand is being issued and the general nature of the testimony, including the primary areas of inquiry, which will be taken pursuant to the demand.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Any civil investigative demand issued under this section which is an express demand for any product of discovery shall not be returned or returnable until 20 days after a copy of such demand has been served upon the person from whom the discovery was obtained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) The date prescribed for the commencement of oral testimony pursuant to a civil investigative demand issued under this section shall be a date which is not less than seven days after the date on which demand is received, unless the Attorney General or an Assistant Attorney General designated by the Attorney General determines that exceptional circumstances are present which war<!-- PDFPage:228 -->rant the commencement of such testimony within a lesser period of time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) The Attorney General shall not authorize the issuance under this section of more than one civil investigative demand for oral testimony by the same person unless the person requests otherwise or unless the Attorney General, after investigation, notifies that person in writing that an additional demand for oral testimony is necessary. The Attorney General may not, notwithstanding section 510 of title 28, authorize the performance, by any other officer, employee, or agency, of any function vested in the Attorney General under this subparagraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Protected Material or Information.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A civil investigative demand issued under subsection (a) may not require the production of any documentary material, the submission of any answers to written interrogatories, or the giving of any oral testimony if such material, answers, or testimony would be protected from disclosure under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the standards applicable to subpoenas or subpoenas duces tecum issued by a court of the United States to aid in a grand jury investigation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the standards applicable to discovery requests under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to the extent that the application of such standards to any such demand is appropriate and consistent with the provisions and purposes of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Effect on other orders, rules, and laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any such demand which is an express demand for any product of discovery supersedes any inconsistent order, rule, or provision of law (other than this section) preventing or restraining disclosure of such product of discovery to any person. Disclosure of any product of discovery pursuant to any such express demand does not constitute a waiver of any right or privilege which the person making such disclosure may be entitled to invoke to resist discovery of trial preparation materials.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Service; Jurisdiction.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>By whom served</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any civil investigative demand issued under subsection (a) may be served by a false claims law investigator, or by a United States marshal or a deputy marshal, at any place within the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Service in foreign countries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any such demand or any petition filed under subsection (j) may be served upon any person who is not found within the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States in such manner as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure prescribe for service in a foreign country. To the extent that the courts of the United States can assert jurisdiction over any such person consistent with due process, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have the same jurisdiction to take any action respecting compliance with this section by any such person that such court would have if such person were personally within the jurisdiction of such court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Service Upon Legal Entities and Natural Persons.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Proof of Service</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A verified return by the individual serving any civil investigative demand issued under subsection (a) or any petition filed under subsection (j) setting forth the manner of such service shall be proof of such service. In the case of service by registered or certified mail, such return shall be accompanied by the return post office receipt of delivery of such demand.</p>

Such material shall be made so available on the return date specified in such demand, or on such later date as the false claims law investigator may prescribe in writing. Such person may, upon written agreement between the person and the false claims law investigator, substitute copies for originals of all or any part of such material.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Interrogatories</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each interrogatory in a civil investigative demand served under this section shall be answered separately and fully in writing under oath and shall be submitted under a sworn certificate, in such form as the demand designates, by&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The examination of any person pursuant to a civil investigative demand for oral testimony served under this section shall be taken before an officer authorized to administer oaths and affirmations by the laws of the United States or of the place where the examination is held. The officer before whom the testimony is to be taken shall put the witness on oath or affirmation and shall, personally or by someone acting under the direction of the officer and in the officer's presence, record the testimony of the witness. The testimony shall be taken stenographically and shall be transcribed. When the testimony is fully transcribed, the officer before whom the testimony is taken shall promptly transmit a copy of the transcript of the testimony to the custodian. This subsection shall not preclude the taking of testimony by any means authorized by, and in a manner consistent with, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Persons present</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The false claims law investigator conducting the examination shall exclude from the place where the examination is held all persons except the person giving the testimony, the attorney for and any other representative of the person giving the testimony, the attorney for the Government, any person who may be agreed upon by the attorney for the Government and the person giving the testimony, the officer before whom the testimony is to be taken, and any stenographer taking such testimony.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Transcript of testimony</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the testimony is fully transcribed, the false claims law investigator or the officer before whom the testimony is taken shall afford the witness, who may be accompanied by counsel, a reasonable opportunity to examine and read the transcript, unless such examination and reading are waived by the witness. Any changes in form or substance which the witness desires to make shall be entered and identified upon the transcript by the officer or the false claims law investigator, with a statement of the reasons given by the witness for making such changes. The transcript shall then be signed by the witness, unless the witness in writing waives the signing, is ill, cannot be found, or refuses to sign. If the transcript is not signed by the witness within 30 days after being afforded a reasonable opportunity to examine it, the officer or the false claims law investigator shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver, illness, absence of the witness, or the refusal to sign, together with the reasons, if any, given therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Certification and delivery to custodian</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The officer before whom the testimony is taken shall certify on the transcript that the witness was sworn by the officer and that the transcript is a true record of the testimony given by the witness, and the officer or false claims law investigator shall promptly deliver the transcript, or send the transcript by registered or certified mail, to the custodian.</p>

Counsel may advise such person, in confidence, with respect to any question asked of such person. Such person or counsel may object on the record to any question, in whole or in part, and shall briefly state for the record the reason for the objection. An objection may be made, received, and entered upon the record when it is claimed that such person is entitled to refuse to answer the question on the grounds of any constitutional or other legal right or privilege, including the privilege against self-incrimination. Such person may not otherwise object to or refuse to answer any question, and may not directly or through counsel otherwise interrupt the oral examination. If such person <!-- PDFPage:230 -->refuses to answer any question, a petition may be filed in the district court of the United States under subsection (j)(1) for an order compelling such person to answer such question.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If such person refuses to answer any question on the grounds of the privilege against self-incrimination, the testimony of such person may be compelled in accordance with the provisions of part V of title 18.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Designation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Attorney General shall designate a false claims law investigator to serve as custodian of documentary material, answers to interrogatories, and transcripts of oral testimony received under this section, and shall designate such additional false claims law investigators as the Attorney General determines from time to time to be necessary to serve as deputies to the custodian.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Responsibility for materials; disclosure</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) A false claims law investigator who receives any documentary material, answers to interrogatories, or transcripts of oral testimony under this section shall transmit them to the custodian. The custodian shall take physical possession of such material, answers, or transcripts and shall be responsible for the use made of them and for the return of documentary material under paragraph (4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The custodian may cause the preparation of such copies of such documentary material, answers to interrogatories, or transcripts of oral testimony as may be required for official use by any false claims law investigator, or other officer or employee of the Department of Justice, who is authorized for such use under regulations which the Attorney General shall issue. Such material, answers, and transcripts may be used by any such authorized false claims law investigator or other officer or employee in connection with the taking of oral testimony under this section.</p>

Nothing in this subparagraph is intended to prevent disclosure to the Congress, including any committee or subcommittee of the Congress, or to any other agency of the United States for use by such agency in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities. Disclosure of information to any such other agency shall be allowed only upon application, made by the Attorney General to a United States district court, showing substantial need for the use of the information by such agency in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities.</p>

Upon the completion of any such case or proceeding, such attorney shall return to the custodian any such material, answers, or transcripts so delivered which have not passed into the control of such court, grand jury, or agency through introduction into the record of such case or proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Conditions for return of material</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If any documentary material has been produced by any person in the course of any false claims law investigation pursuant to a civil investigative demand under this section, and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any case or proceeding before the court or grand jury arising out of such investigation, or any proceeding before any Federal agency involving such material, has been completed, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) no case or proceeding in which such material may be used has been commenced within a reasonable time after completion of the examination and analysis of all documentary material and other information assembled in the course of such investigation,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the custodian shall, upon written request of the person who produced such material, return to such person any such material (other than copies furnished to the false claims law investigator under subsection (f)(2) or made for the Department of Justice under paragraph (2)(B)) which has not passed into the control of any court, grand jury, or agency through introduction into the record of such case or proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Appointment of successor custodians</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the event of the death, disability, or separa<!-- PDFPage:231 -->tion from service in the Department of Justice of the custodian of any documentary material, answers to interrogatories, or transcripts of oral testimony produced pursuant to a civil investigative demand under this section, or in the event of the official relief of such custodian from responsibility for the custody and control of such material, answers, or transcripts, the Attorney General shall promptly&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) designate another false claims law investigator to serve as custodian of such material, answers, or transcripts, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) transmit in writing to the person who produced such material, answers, or testimony notice of the identity and address of the successor so designated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Any person who is designated to be a successor under this paragraph shall have, with regard to such material, answers, or transcripts, the same duties and responsibilities as were imposed by this section upon that person's predecessor in office, except that the successor shall not be held responsible for any default or dereliction which occurred before that designation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Judicial Proceedings.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Petition for enforcement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever any person fails to comply with any civil investigative demand issued under subsection (a), or whenever satisfactory copying or reproduction of any material requested in such demand cannot be done and such person refuses to surrender such material, the Attorney General may file, in the district court of the United States for any judicial district in which such person resides, is found, or transacts business, and serve upon such person a petition for an order of such court for the enforcement of the civil investigative demand.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Petition to modify or set aside demand</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) Any person who has received a civil investigative demand issued under subsection (a) may file, in the district court of the United States for the judicial district within which such person resides, is found, or transacts business, and serve upon the false claims law investigator identified in such demand a petition for an order of the court to modify or set aside such demand. In the case of a petition addressed to an express demand for any product of discovery, a petition to modify or set aside such demand may be brought only in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the proceeding in which such discovery was obtained is or was last pending.
