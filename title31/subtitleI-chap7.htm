<p class="note-body">In clause (1), &ldquo;agency&rdquo; (which is defined for purposes of this title in section 101 to mean a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States) is coextensive with and substituted for the term &ldquo;department or establishment&rdquo; which was defined in 31:2 as in part meaning &ldquo;any executive department, independent commission, board, bureau, office, agency, or other establishment of the Government, including any independent regulatory commission or board&rdquo;. This definition merely restates and continues, and does not in any way change or expand, the definition in 31:2. Under that definition, entities such as the Tennessee Valley Authority that have been interpreted to be outside the purview of the definition will continue to be outside the purview in the same manner and to the same extent that they were under 31:2. The words &ldquo;includes the District of Columbia government&rdquo; are used because of existing law but the inclusion of these words is not to be interpreted as construing the extent to which the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganizational Act (Pub. L. 93&ndash;198, 87 Stat. 774) supersedes the provisions codified in this title. The words &ldquo;of the United States&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The text of 31:2 (2d&ndash;4th pars.) is omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The text of section 2 (3d par.) of the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921 (ch. 18, 42 Stat. 20), is omitted as obsolete because of section 501 of the revised title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Each agency shall give the Comptroller General information the Comptroller General requires about the duties, powers, activities, organization, and financial transactions of the agency. The Comptroller General may inspect an agency record to get the information. This subsection does not apply to expenditures made under section 3524 or 3526(e) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) When an agency record is not made available to the Comptroller General within a reasonable time, the Comptroller General may make a written request to the head of the agency. The request shall state the authority for inspecting the records and the reason for the inspection. The head of the agency has 20 days after receiving the request to respond. The response shall describe the record withheld and the reason the record is being withheld. If the Comptroller General is not given an opportunity to inspect the record within the 20-day period, the Comptroller General may file a report with the President, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Attorney General, the head of the agency, and Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Through an attorney the Comptroller General designates in writing, the Comptroller General may bring a civil action in the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia to require the head of the agency to produce a record&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) after 20 days after a report is filed under paragraph (1) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) subject to subsection (d) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Attorney General may represent the head of the agency. The court may punish a failure to obey an order of the court under this subsection as a contempt of court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Subject to subsection (d) of this section, the Comptroller General may subpena a record of a person not in the United States Government when the record is not made available to the Comptroller General to which the Comptroller General has access by law or by agreement of that person from whom access is sought. A subpena shall identify the record and the authority for the inspection and may be issued by the Comptroller General. The Comptroller General <!-- PDFPage:56 -->may have an individual serve a subpena under this subsection by delivering a copy to the person named in the subpena or by mailing a copy of the subpena by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the residence or principal place of business of the person. Proof of service is shown by a verified return by the individual serving the subpena that states how the subpena was served or by the return receipt signed by the person served.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a person residing, found, or doing business in a judicial district refuses to comply with a subpena issued under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Comptroller General, through an attorney the Comptroller General designates in writing, may bring a civil action in that district court to require the person to produce the record. The court has jurisdiction of the action and may punish a failure to obey an order of the court under this subsection as a contempt of court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Comptroller General may not bring a civil action for a record withheld under subsection (b) of this section or issue a subpena under subsection (c) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the record related to activities the President designates as foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the record is specifically exempted from disclosure to the Comptroller General by a statute that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) without discretion requires that the record be withheld from the Comptroller General;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding the record from the Comptroller General; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) refers to particular types of records to be withheld from the Comptroller General; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) by the 20th day after a report is filed under subsection (b)(1) of this section, the President or the Director certifies to the Comptroller General and Congress that a record could be withheld under section 552(b)(5) or (7) of title 5 and disclosure reasonably could be expected to impair substantially the operations of the Government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President or the Director may not delegate certification under paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection. A certification shall include a complete explanation of the reasons for the certification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) The Comptroller General shall maintain the same level of confidentiality for a record made available under this section as is required of the head of the agency from which it is obtained. Officers and employees of the Government Accountability Office are subject to the same statutory penalties for unauthorized disclosure or use as officers or employees of the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Comptroller General shall keep information described in section 552(b)(6) of title 5 that the Comptroller General obtains in a way that prevents unwarranted invasions of personal privacy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This section does not authorize information to be withheld from Congress.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the term of a member of the Board is 5 years. A member may not be reappointed. An individual appointed to fill a vacancy occurring before the expiration of a term of office is appointed for the remainder of the term.

<p class="statutory-body">(C) A term established for a member under this paragraph shall be measured&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) from the date on which the member was originally appointed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of a member serving for the unexpired portion of a term, from the appointment date of the individual who was originally appointed to serve for such term.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:70 --><p class="statutory-body">(d) A member may be removed by a majority of the Board (except the member subject to removal) only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.
