<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) While the Secretary has the responsibility to act with regard to Federal offenses which are being committed in a particular locality or are directed at a single institution, because modern financial systems and institutions are interconnected to a degree which was not possible until recently, money laundering and other related financial crimes are likely to have local, State, national, and international effects wherever they are committed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Purpose and objective</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the purpose of this section to provide a mechanism for designating any area where money laundering or a related financial crime appears to be occurring at a higher than average rate such that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a comprehensive approach to the problem of such crime in such area can be developed, in cooperation with State and local law enforcement agencies, which utilizes the authority of the Secretary to prevent such activity; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Element of National Strategy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The designation of certain areas as areas in which money laundering and related financial crimes are extensive or present a substantial risk shall be an element of the national strategy developed pursuant to section 5341(b).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Specific initiatives</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any head of a department, bureau, or law enforcement agency, including any State or local prosecutor, involved in the detection, prevention, and suppression of money laundering and related financial crimes and any State or local official or prosecutor may submit&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Whether the area is a key transportation hub with any international ports or airports or an extensive highway system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Whether the area is an international center for banking or commerce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Unusual patterns, anomalies, or changes in the volume or nature of transactions conducted through financial institutions operating within or outside the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) The extent to which State and local governments and State and local law enforcement agencies have committed resources to respond to the financial crime problem in the area and the degree to which the commitment of such resources reflects a determination by such government and agencies to address the problem aggressively.</p>
