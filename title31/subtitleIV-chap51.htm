<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;money&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;money of account&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. As far as can be determined, the phrase &ldquo;money of account&rdquo; has not been interpreted by any court or Government agency. The phrase was used by Alexander Hamilton in his &ldquo;Report on the Establishment of the Mint&rdquo; (1791). In that Report, Hamilton propounded 6 questions, including:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&nbsp;1st. What ought to be the nature of the money unit of the United States?</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Thereafter, Hamilton uses the phrases &ldquo;money unit of the United States&rdquo; and &ldquo;money of account&rdquo; interchangeably and in the sense that the phrases are used to denote the monetary system for keeping financial accounts. In short, the phrases simply indicate that financial accounts are to be based on a decimal money system:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;., and it is certain that nothing can be more simple and convenient than the decimal subdivisions. There is every reason to expect that the method will speedily grow into general use, when it shall be seconded by corresponding coins. On this plan the unit in the money of account will continue to be, as established by that resolution [of August 8, 1786], a dollar, and its multiples, dimes, cents, and mills, or tenths, hundreths, [sic] and thousands.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Thus, the phrase &ldquo;money of account&rdquo; did not mean, by itself, that dollars or fractions of dollars must be equal to something having intrinsic or &ldquo;substantive&rdquo; value. This concept is supported by earlier writings of Thomas Jefferson in his &ldquo;Notes on the Establishment of a Money Unit, and of a Coinage for the United States&rdquo; (1784), and the 1782 report to the President of the Continental Congress on the coinage of the United States by the Superintendent of Finances, Robert Morris, which was apparently prepared by the Assistant Super<!-- PDFPage:280 -->intendent, Gouverneur Morris. See Paul L. Ford, <em>The Writings of Thomas Jefferson</em>, vol. III (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1894) pp. 446&ndash;457; William G. Sumner, <em>The Financier and the Finances of the American Revolution</em>, vol. II (Burt Franklin, 1891, reprinted 1970) pp. 36&ndash;47; and George T. Curtis, <em>History of the Constitution</em>, vol. I (Harper and Brothers, 1859) p. 443, n2. The words &ldquo;or units&rdquo; and &ldquo;and all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary of the Treasury&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) may prepare and distribute numismatic items; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) may mint coins for a foreign country if the minting does not interfere with regular minting operations, and shall prescribe a charge for minting the foreign coins equal to the cost of the minting (including labor, materials, and the use of machinery).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Department of the Treasury has a coinage metal fund and a coinage profit fund. The Secretary may use the coinage metal fund to buy metal to mint coins. The Secretary shall credit the coinage profit fund with the amount by which the nominal value of the coins minted from the metal exceeds the cost of the metal. The Secretary shall charge the coinage profit fund with waste incurred in minting coins and the cost of distributing the coins, including the cost of coin bags and pallets. The Secretary shall deposit in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts excess amounts in the coinage profit fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Procurements Relating to Coin Production.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may make contracts, on conditions the Secretary decides are appropriate and are in the public interest, to acquire articles, materials, supplies, and services (including equipment, manufacturing facilities, patents, patent rights, technical knowledge, and assistance) necessary to produce the coins referred to in this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Domestic control of coinage</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), in order to protect the national security through domestic control of the coinage process, the Secretary shall acquire only such articles, materials, supplies, and services (including equipment, manufacturing facilities, patents, patent rights, technical knowledge, and assistance) for the production of coins as have been produced or manufactured in the United States unless the Secretary determines it to be inconsistent with the public interest, or the cost to be unreasonable, and publishes in the Federal Register a written finding stating the basis for the determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Subparagraph (A) shall apply only in the case of a bid or offer from a supplier the principal place of business of which is in a foreign country which does not accord to United States companies the same competitive opportunities for procurements in connection with the production of coins as it accords to domestic companies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Determination.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any determination of the Secretary referred to in paragraph (2) shall not be reviewable in any administrative proceeding or court of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Other rights unaffected</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This paragraph does not alter or annul any right of review that arises under any provision of any law or regulation of the United States other than paragraph (2).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Nothing in paragraph (2) of this subsection in any way affects the procurement by the Secretary of gold and silver for the production of coins by the United States Mint.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Secretary may prohibit or limit the exportation, melting, or treatment of United States coins when the Secretary decides the prohibition or limitation is necessary to protect the coinage of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person knowingly violating an order or license issued or regulation prescribed under paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall be fined not more than $10,000, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Coins exported, melted, or treated in violation of an order or license issued or regulation prescribed, and metal resulting from the melting or treatment, shall be forfeited to the United States Government. The powers of the Secretary and the remedies available to enforce forfeitures are those provided in part II of subchapter C of chapter 75 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954&nbsp;<sup><a href="#5111_1_target" name="5111_1">1</a></sup> (26 U.S.C. 7321 et seq.).</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words before clause (1) are added because of the restatement.

The word &ldquo;bars&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;ingots&rdquo; for consistency in the revised chapter. The words &ldquo;2.5 percent&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;twenty-five thousandths&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words &ldquo;from the percent of nickel required&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the legal standard .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the proportion of nickel&rdquo; because of the restatement. The words &ldquo;In silver ingots, six-thousandths&rdquo; are omitted as superseded by the source provisions restated in the section. The words &ldquo;In gold ingots, one-thousandth&rdquo; in section 3533 of the Revised Statutes are omitted because gold coinage was discontinued by 31:315b. The words &ldquo;Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section&rdquo; are added for clarity and because of the restatement.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;a different weight and alloy of copper and zinc&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;such action&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d)(1), the words &ldquo;an impression emblematic of liberty&rdquo; in 31:324 are omitted as obsolete. The words &ldquo;The design on the reverse side of the dollar, half dollar, and quarter dollar is an eagle&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;and upon the reverse side shall be the figure or representation of an eagle .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but on the dime, 5-, and 1-cent piece, the figure of the eagle shall be omitted&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;The emblem on the obverse side of the dollar is&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;The one-dollar coin authorized by section 391(c) of this title shall bear on the obverse side&rdquo; in 31:324b&ndash;1, to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;Any coins minted after July 23, 1965, from 900 fine coin silver shall be inscribed with the year 1964&rdquo; in 31:324 are omitted because the Secretary no longer has authority to mint coins from 900 fine coin silver.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d)(2), the word &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;engraver&rdquo;, &ldquo;Director of the Mint&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Director of the Mint .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury&rdquo; because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. The word &ldquo;dies&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;from the original dies already authorized all the working dies required for use in the coinage of the several mints&rdquo; and &ldquo;original dies&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The word &ldquo;inscription&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;legend&rdquo; for consistency in the section. The words &ldquo;<em>Provided</em>, That no change be made in the diameter of any coin&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because the diameters are prescribed by subsection (a) of the revised section. The words &ldquo;procure services under section 3109 of title 5 in carrying out this paragraph&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;engage temporarily for this purpose the services of one or more artists, distinguished in their respective departments of art&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;who shall be paid for such service from the contingent appropriation for the mint at Philadelphia&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete. The text of section 3510(2d proviso) of the Revised Statutes is omitted as executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e)(2), the words &ldquo;80 percent&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;eight hundred parts&rdquo; in 31:391(d), and the words &ldquo;20 percent&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;two hundred parts&rdquo;, for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The words &ldquo;that are metallurgically bonded to&rdquo; are added for clarity and consistency with subsection (b). In clause (4), the words &ldquo;the late President of the United States&rdquo; in 31:324b are omitted as unnecessary. Clause (6) is added because 31:324 applies to coins minted under this subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f)(1), before clause (A), the words &ldquo;Notwithstanding this section and section 5111(a)(1) of this title are substituted for &ldquo;Notwithstanding any other provision of law&rdquo; in 31:399 for clarity. In clause (B), the words &ldquo;are an alloy of 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;be minted in accordance with the standard established in section 3514 of the Revised Statutes (31 U.S.C. 321)&rdquo; and 31:321 to eliminate unnecessary words and for clarity. In clause (C), the word &ldquo;symbolizing&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;emblematic&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f)(2), the words &ldquo;under such regulations as he may prescribe&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of section 321 of the revised title. The word &ldquo;Treasury&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;general fund of the Treasury&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">The text of 31:399(b)(3) is omitted as unnecessary because of section 5103 of the revised title.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Presidential Commemorative Dollar Coins; Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;145, title I, &sect;101, Dec. 22, 2005, 119 Stat. 2664, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:292 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) There are sectors of the United States economy, including public transportation, parking meters, vending machines, and low-dollar value transactions, in which the use of a $1 coin is both useful and desirable for keeping costs and prices down.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) For a variety of reasons, the new $1 coin introduced in 2000 has not been widely sought-after by the public, leading to higher costs for merchants and thus higher prices for consumers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The success of the 50 States Commemorative Coin Program (31 U.S.C. 5112(<em>l</em>)) for circulating quarter dollars shows that a design on a United States circulating coin that is regularly changed in a manner similar to the systematic change in designs in such Program radically increases demand for the coin, rapidly pulling it through the economy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The 50 States Commemorative Coin Program also has been an educational tool, teaching both Americans and visitors something about each State for which a quarter has been issued.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) A national survey and study by the Government Accountability Office has indicated that many Americans who do not seek, or who reject, the new $1 coin for use in commerce would actively seek the coin if an attractive, educational rotating design were to be struck on the coin.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The President is the leader of our tripartite government and the President's spouse has often set the social tone for the White House while spearheading and highlighting important issues for the country.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Sacagawea, as currently represented on the new $1 coin, is an important symbol of American history.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Many people cannot name all of the Presidents, and fewer can name the spouses, nor can many people accurately place each President in the proper time period of American history.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) First Spouses have not generally been recognized on American coinage.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) In order to revitalize the design of United States coinage and return circulating coinage to its position as not only a necessary means of exchange in commerce, but also as an object of aesthetic beauty in its own right, it is appropriate to move many of the mottos and emblems, the inscription of the year, and the so-called &lsquo;mint marks&rsquo; that currently appear on the 2 faces of each circulating coin to the edge of the coin, which would allow larger and more dramatic artwork on the coins reminiscent of the so-called &lsquo;Golden Age of Coinage&rsquo; in the United States, at the beginning of the Twentieth Century, initiated by President Theodore Roosevelt, with the assistance of noted sculptors and medallic artists James Earle Fraser and Augustus Saint-Gaudens.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Placing inscriptions on the edge of coins, known as edge-incusing, is a hallmark of modern coinage and is common in large-volume production of coinage elsewhere in the world, such as the 2,700,000,000 2-Euro coins in circulation, but it has not been done on a large scale in United States coinage in recent years.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Although the Congress has authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue gold coins with a purity of 99.99 percent, the Secretary has not done so.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) Bullion coins are a valuable tool for the investor and, in some cases, an important aspect of coin collecting.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;145, title III, Dec. 22, 2005, 119 Stat. 2673, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 301. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, was one of the Nation's greatest leaders, demonstrating true courage during the Civil War, one of the greatest crises in the Nation's history.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Born of humble roots in Hardin County (present-day LaRue County), Kentucky, on February 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln rose to the Presidency through a combination of honesty, integrity, intelligence, and commitment to the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) With the belief that all men are created equal, Abraham Lincoln led the effort to free all slaves in the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Abraham Lincoln had a generous heart, with malice toward none, and with charity for all.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Abraham Lincoln gave the ultimate sacrifice for the country he loved, dying from an assassin's bullet on April 15, 1865.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of Abraham Lincoln, for Lincoln's life is a model for accomplishing the &lsquo;American dream&rsquo; through honesty, integrity, loyalty, and a lifetime of education.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The year 2009 will be the bicentennial anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky, grew to adulthood in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, and led the nation in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The so-called &lsquo;Lincoln cent&rsquo; was introduced in 1909 on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, making the obverse design the most enduring on the nation's coinage.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) President Theodore Roosevelt was so impressed by the talent of Victor David Brenner that the sculptor was chosen to design the likeness of President Lincoln for the coin, adapting a design from a plaque Brenner had prepared earlier.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) In the nearly 100 years of production of the &lsquo;Lincoln cent&rsquo;, there have been only 2 designs on the reverse: the original, featuring 2 wheat-heads in memorial style enclosing mottoes, and the current representation of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) On the occasion of the bicentennial of President Lincoln's birth and the 100th anniversary of the production of the Lincoln cent, it is entirely fitting to issue a series of 1-cent coins with designs on the reverse that are emblematic of the 4 major periods of President Lincoln's life.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 302. REDESIGN OF LINCOLN CENT FOR 2009.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;During the year 2009, the Secretary of the Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in accordance with the following design specifications:</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Reverse</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The reverse of the coins shall bear 4 different designs each representing a different aspect of the life of Abraham Lincoln, such as&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) his birth and early childhood in Kentucky;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) his formative years in Indiana;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) his professional life in Illinois; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) his presidency, in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Issuance of Redesigned Lincoln Cents in</cap-smallcap> 2009.&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The 1-cent coins to which this section applies shall be issued with 1 of the 4 designs referred to in subsection (a)(2) beginning at the start of each calendar quarter of 2009.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Number</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall prescribe, on the basis of such factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, the number of 1-cent coins that shall be issued with each of the designs selected for each calendar quarter of 2009.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Design Selection</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The designs for the coins specified in this section shall be chosen by the Secretary&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in 2009 with the exact metallic content as the 1-cent coin contained in 1909 in such number as the Secretary determines to be appropriate for numismatic purposes.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the sense of the Congress that the original Victor David Brenner design for the 1-cent coin was a dramatic departure from previous American coinage that should be reproduced, using the original form and relief of the likeness of Abraham Lincoln, on the 1-cent coins issued in 2009.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amounts received from the purchase of gold are an asset of the general fund of the Treasury. Amounts received from the sale of gold shall be deposited by the Secretary in the general fund of the Treasury and shall be used for the sole purpose of reducing the national debt.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall acquire gold for the coins issued under section 5112(i) of this title by purchase of gold mined from natural deposits in the United States, or in a territory or possession of the United States, within one year after the month in which the ore from which it is derived was mined. The Secretary shall pay not more than the average world price for the gold. In the absence of available supplies of such gold at the average world price, the Secretary may use gold from reserves held by the United States to mint the coins issued under section 5112(i) of this title. The Secretary shall issue such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary may buy silver mined from natural deposits in the United States, or in a territory or possession of the United States, that is brought to a United States mint or assay office within one year after the month in which the ore from which it is derived was mined.

The Secretary shall obtain the silver for the coins authorized under section 5112(e) of this title by purchase from stockpiles established under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.). At such time as the silver stockpile is depleted, the Secretary shall obtain silver as described in paragraph (1) to mint coins authorized under section 5112(e). If it is not economically feasible to obtain such silver, the Secretary may obtain silver for coins authorized under section 5112(e) from other available sources. The Secretary shall not pay more than the average world price for silver under any circumstances. As used in this paragraph, the term &ldquo;average world price&rdquo; means the price determined by a widely recognized commodity exchange at the time the silver is obtained by the Secretary. The Secretary shall sell silver under conditions the Secretary considers appropriate for at least $1.292929292 a fine troy ounce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary of the Treasury shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) melt and refine bullion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as required, assay coins, metal, and bullion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) cast gold and silver bullion deposits into bars; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) cast alloys into bars for minting coins.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A person owning gold or silver bullion may deposit the bullion with the Secretary to be cast into fine, standard fineness, or unrefined bars weighing at least 5 troy ounces. When practicable, the Secretary shall weigh the bullion in front of the depositor. The Secretary shall give the depositor a receipt for the bullion stating the description and weight of the bullion. When the Secretary has to melt the bullion or remove base metals before the value of the bullion can be determined, the weight is the weight after the melting or removal of the metals. The Secretary may refuse a deposit of gold bullion if the deposit is less than $100 in value or the bullion is so base that it is unsuitable for the operations of the Bureau of the Mint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When the gold and silver are combined in bullion that is deposited and either the gold or silver is so little that it cannot be separated economically, the Secretary may not pay the <!-- PDFPage:304 -->depositor for the gold or silver that cannot be separated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, a person may exchange unrefined bullion for fine bars when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) gold and silver are combined in the bullion in proportions that cannot be economically refined; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) necessary supplies of acids cannot be procured at reasonable rates.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The charge for refining in an exchange under this subsection may be not more than the charge imposed in an exchange of unrefined bullion for refined bullion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary shall prepare bars for payment of deposits. The Secretary shall stamp each bar with a designation of the weight and fineness of the bar and a symbol the Secretary considers suitable to prevent fraudulent imitation of the bar.</p>
