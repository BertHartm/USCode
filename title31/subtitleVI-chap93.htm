<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) If a person is required under a law of the United States to give a surety bond, the person may give a Government obligation as security instead of a surety bond. The obligation shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) be given to the official having authority to approve the surety bond;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) be in an amount equal at par value to the amount of the required surety bond; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) authorize the official receiving the obligation to collect or sell the obligation if the person defaults on a required condition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) An official receiving a Government obligation under subsection (a) of this section may deposit it with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary of the Treasury;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a Federal reserve bank; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a depositary designated by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary, bank, or depositary shall issue a receipt that describes the obligation deposited.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Using a Government obligation instead of a surety bond for security is the same as using&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a personal or corporate surety bond;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a certified check;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a bank draft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a post office money order; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) cash.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When security is no longer required, a Government obligation given instead of a surety bond shall be returned to the person giving the obligation. If a person, supplying labor or material to a contractor defaulting under the Act of August 24, 1935 (known as the Miller Act) (40 U.S.C. 270a&ndash;270d), files with the United States Government the application and affidavit provided under section 3 of the Act (40 U.S.C. 270c), the Government&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may return to the contractor the Government obligation given as security (or proceeds <!-- PDFPage:338 -->of the Government obligation given) under the Act of August 24, 1935 (known as the Miller Act) (40 U.S.C. 270a&ndash;270d), only after the 90-day period for bringing a civil action under section 2 of the Act (40 U.S.C. 270b); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if a civil action is brought in the 90-day period, shall hold the Government obligation or the proceeds subject to the order of the court having jurisdiction of the action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) This section does not affect the&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) priority of a claim of the Government against a Government obligation given under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) right or remedy of the Government for default on an obligation provided under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Act of August 24, 1935 (known as the Miller Act) (40 U.S.C. 270a&ndash;270d); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) this section;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) authority of a court over a Government obligation given as security in a civil action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) authority of an official of the Government authorized by another law to receive a Government obligation as security.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) To avoid frequent substitution of Government obligations, the Secretary may prescribe regulations limiting the effect of this section to a Government obligation maturing more than one year after the date the obligation is given as security.</p>
