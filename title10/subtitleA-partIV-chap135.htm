<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall establish procedures for the conduct of the pilot program. As part of those procedures, the Secretary may allow space surveillance data and analysis of space surveillance data to be provided through a contractor of the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Duration of Pilot Program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The pilot program under this section shall be conducted during the three-year period beginning on a date specified by the Secretary of Defense, which date shall be not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this section.</p>
