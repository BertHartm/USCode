<p class="note-body">Section 4 of the Act of January 16, 1936, ch. 3, 49 Stat. 1092, provided that persons who were then members of the teaching staff should have the right to participate in benefits under the Act if they requested such participation within 60 days. Members who were then under the civil-service retirement system were required to choose whether they would remain under it or would participate in the system established by the 1936 Act. They could not come under both. The section also authorized the Secretary of the Navy to supplement the retired income of members who elected to come under the 1936 Act and whose age in 1936 was such that they could not purchase adequate annuities before retiring. The provisions whereby members could elect to participate were temporary and are executed. The provisions relating to retired income are superseded by &sect;4A, added by the Act of November 28, 1943, ch. 331, 57 Stat. 594. The only remaining effect of &sect;4 and the second proviso of &sect;4A is to exclude from the benefits and requirements of the 1936 Act persons who were members of the teaching staff in 1936 and did not elect to participate.</p>
