No Department of Defense funds may be spent for compensation for any military technician hired after February 10, 1996, who is not a member of the Selected Reserve, except that compensation may be paid for up to six months following loss of membership in the Selected Reserve if such loss of membership was not due to the failure to meet military standards.</p>
