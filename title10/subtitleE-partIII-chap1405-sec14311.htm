<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Delay During Investigations and Proceedings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the military department concerned, the appointment of an officer to a higher grade may be delayed if any of the following applies before the date on which the appointment would otherwise be made:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Sworn charges against the officer have been received by an officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the officer and the charges have not been disposed of.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) An investigation is being conducted to determine whether disciplinary action of any kind should be brought against the officer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A board of officers has been convened under section 14903 of this title to review the record of the officer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) A criminal proceeding in a Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction is pending against the officer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If disciplinary action is not taken against the officer, if the charges against the officer are withdrawn or dismissed, if the officer is not separated by the Secretary of the military department concerned as the result of having been required to show cause for retention, or if the officer is acquitted of the charges, as the case may be, then (unless action to delay the officer's appointment to the higher grade has been taken under subsection (b)) the officer shall be retained on the promotion list, list of officers found qualified for Federal recognition, or list of officers nominated by the President to the Senate for appointment in a higher reserve grade and shall, upon promotion to the next higher grade, have the same date of rank, the same effective date for the pay and allowances of the grade to which promoted, and the same position on the reserve active-status list as the officer would have had if no delay had intervened, unless the Secretary concerned determines that the officer was unqualified for promotion for any part of the delay. If the Secretary makes such a determination, the Secretary may adjust such date of rank, effective date of pay and allowances, and position on the reserve active-status list as the Secretary considers appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Delay for Lack of Qualifications</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the military department concerned, the appointment of an officer to a higher grade may also be delayed if there is cause to believe that the officer is mentally, physically, morally, or professionally unqualified to perform the duties of the grade to which selected. If the Secretary concerned later determines that the officer is qualified for promotion to the higher grade, the officer shall be retained on the promotion list, the list of officers found qualified for Federal recognition, or list of officers nominated by the President to the Senate for appointment in a higher reserve grade, and shall, upon promotion to that grade, have the same date of rank, the same effective date for pay and allowances of that grade, and the same position on the reserve active-status list as the officer would have had if no delay had intervened, unless the Secretary concerned determines that the officer was unqualified for promotion for any part of the delay. If the Secretary makes such a determination, the Secretary may adjust such date of rank, effective date of pay and allowances, and position on the reserve active-status list as the Secretary considers appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Notice to Officer</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The appointment of an officer to a higher grade may not be delayed under subsection (a) or (b) unless the officer is given written notice of the grounds for the delay. The preceding sentence does not apply if it is impracticable to give the officer written notice before the date on which the appointment to the higher grade would otherwise take effect, but in such a case the written notice shall be given as soon as practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An officer whose promotion is delayed under subsection (a) or (b) shall be given an opportunity to make a written statement to the Secretary of the military department concerned in response to the action taken. The Secretary shall give consideration to any such statement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Length of Delay in Promotion</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The appointment of an officer to a higher grade may not be delayed under subsection (a) or (b) for more than six months after the date on which the officer would otherwise have been promoted unless the Secretary concerned specifies a further period of delay. An officer's appointment may not be delayed more than 90 days after final action has been taken in any criminal case against the officer in a Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction or more than 90 days after final action has been taken in any court-martial case against the officer. Except for court action, a promotion may not be delayed more than 18 months after the date on which the officer would otherwise have been promoted.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1784 --><p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Delay Because of Limitations on Officer Strength in Grade or Duties to Which Assigned</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, the promotion of a reserve officer on the reserve active-status list who is serving on active duty, or who is on full-time National Guard duty for administration of the reserves or the National Guard, to a grade to which the strength limitations of section 12011 of this title apply shall be delayed if necessary to ensure compliance with those strength limitations. The delay shall expire when the Secretary determines that the delay is no longer required to ensure such compliance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The promotion of an officer described in paragraph (1) shall also be delayed while the officer is on duty described in that paragraph unless the Secretary of the military department concerned, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, determines that the duty assignment of the officer requires a higher grade than the grade currently held by the officer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The date of rank and position on the reserve active-status list of a reserve officer whose promotion to or Federal recognition in the next higher grade was delayed under paragraph (1) or (2) solely as the result of the limitations imposed under the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense or contained in section 12011 of this title shall be the date on which the officer would have been promoted to or recognized in the higher grade had such limitations not existed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If an officer whose promotion is delayed under paragraph (1) or (2) completes the period of active duty or full-time National Guard duty that the officer is required by law or regulation to perform as a member of a reserve component, the officer may request release from active duty or full-time National Guard duty. If the request is granted, the officer's promotion shall be effective upon the officer's release from such duty. The date of rank and position on the reserve active-status list of the officer shall be the date the officer would have been promoted to or recognized in the higher grade had the limitations imposed under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense contained in section 12011 of this title not existed. If an officer whose promotion is delayed under paragraph (1) or (2) has not completed the period of active duty or full-time National Guard duty that the officer is required by law or regulation to perform as a member of a reserve component, the officer may be retained on active duty or on full-time National Guard duty in the grade in which the officer was serving before the officer's being found qualified for Federal recognition or the officer's selection for the promotion until the officer completes that required period of duty.</p>
