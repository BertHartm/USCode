<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may, at the discretion of the Secretary, permit dependents of members of the armed forces and, to the extent provided in subsection (c), dependents of civilian employees of the Federal Government residing in a territory, commonwealth, or possession of the United States but not on a military installation, to enroll in an educational program provided by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection. If a member of the armed forces is assigned to a remote location or is assigned to an unaccompanied tour of duty, a dependent of the member who resides, on or off a military installation, in a territory, commonwealth, or possession of the United States, as authorized by the member's orders, may be enrolled in an educational program provided by the Secretary under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Factors for Secretary To Consider</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Factors to be considered by the Secretary of Defense in making a determination under subsection (a) shall include the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The extent to which the local educational agency is able to provide an appropriate educational program for such dependents.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
