<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Authority of Secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary of Defense makes a determination that appropriate educational programs are not available through a local educational agency for dependents of members of the armed forces and dependents of civilian employees of the Federal Government residing on a military installation in the United States (including territories, commonwealths, and possessions of the United States), the Secretary may enter into arrangements to provide for the elementary or secondary education of the dependents of such members of the armed forces and, to the extent authorized in subsection (c), the dependents of such civilian employees. The Secretary may, at the discretion of the Secretary, permit dependents of members of the armed forces and, to the extent provided in subsection (c), dependents of civilian employees of the Federal Government residing in a territory, commonwealth, or possession of the United States but not on a military installation, to enroll in an educational program provided by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Factors for Secretary To Consider</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Factors to be considered by the Secretary of Defense in making a determination under subsection (a) shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The extent to which such dependents are eligible for free public education in the local area adjacent to the military installation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The extent to which the local educational agency is able to provide an appropriate educational program for such dependents.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), an appropriate educational program is a program that, as determined by the Secretary, is comparable to a program of free public education provided for children by the following local educational agencies:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the case of a military installation located in a State (other than an installation referred to in subparagraph (B)), local educational agencies in the State that are similar to the local educational agency referred to in paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In the case of a military installation with boundaries contiguous to two or more States, local educational agencies in the contiguous States that are similar to the local educational agency referred to in paragraph (1)(B).</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Eligibility of Dependents of Federal Employees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A dependent of a Federal employee residing in permanent living quarters on a military installation at any time during the school year may enroll in an educational program provided by the Secretary of Defense pursuant to subsection (a) for dependents residing on such installation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A dependent referred to in subparagraph (A) may be enrolled in the program for more than five consecutive school years if the Secretary determines that, in the interest of the dependent's educational well-being, there is good cause to extend the enrollment for more than the five-year period described in such subparagraph. Any such extension may be made for only one school year at a time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an individual who is a dependent of a Federal employee in the excepted service (as defined in section 2103 of title 5) and who is enrolled in an educational program provided by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (a) in Puerto Rico, Wake Island, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A dependent of a Federal employee may continue enrollment in a program under this subsection for the remainder of a school year notwithstanding a change during such school year in the status of the Federal employee that, except for this paragraph, would otherwise terminate the eligibility of the dependent to be enrolled in the program. The preceding sentence does not limit the authority of the Secretary to remove the dependent from enrollment in the program at any time for good cause determined by the Secretary.</p>
