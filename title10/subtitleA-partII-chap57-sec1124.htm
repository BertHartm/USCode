<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. Any suggestion, invention, or scientific achievement by a member of the armed forces that contributes to the efficiency, economy, or other improvement of operations of the Government of the United States through its adoption or use by an executive department or agency other than the executive department having jurisdiction over the armed force of the member concerned may be the basis for honorary recognition or a cash award by the Secretary of Transportation in the case of a member of the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy or by the Secretary of Defense in the case of any other member of the armed forces.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. An executive department or agency that adopts or uses the suggestion, invention, or scientific achievement of a member of the armed forces who is not under its jurisdiction may recommend to the Department of Defense or to the Department of Transportation, as appropriate, a cash award or honorary recognition of the member and shall justify its recommendation with appropriate documentation and explanation of how the suggestion, invention, or scientific achievement contributes to the efficiency, economy, or other improvement of the operations of the Government of the United States. Awards shall be made under regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of Transportation, as appropriate.
