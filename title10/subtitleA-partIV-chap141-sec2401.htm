<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Secretary of a military department may make a contract for the lease of a vessel or aircraft or for the provision of a service through use by a contractor of a vessel or aircraft only as provided in subsection (b) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the contract will be a long-term lease or charter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the terms of the contract provide for a substantial termination liability on the part of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of a military department may make a contract that is an agreement to lease or charter or an agreement to provide services and that is (or will be) accompanied by a contract for the actual lease, charter, or provision of services only as provided in subsection (b) if the contract for the actual lease, charter, or provision of services is (or will be) a contract described in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary may make a contract described in subsection (a)(1) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary has been specifically authorized by law to make the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) before a solicitation for proposals for the contract was issued the Secretary notified the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on National Security and the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives of the Secretary's intention to issue such a solicitation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary has notified those committees of the proposed contract and provided a detailed description of the terms of the proposed contract and a justification for entering into the proposed contract rather than providing for the lease, charter, or services involved through purchase of the vessel or aircraft to be used under the contract, and a period of 30 days of continuous session of Congress has expired following the date on which notice was received by such committees.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(C), the continuity of a session of Congress is broken only by an adjournment of the Congress sine die, and the days on which either House is not in session because of an adjournment of more than three days to a day certain are excluded in a computation of such 30-day period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Funds may not be appropriated for any fiscal year to or for any armed force or obligated or expended for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the long-term lease or charter of any aircraft or naval vessel; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for the lease or charter of any aircraft or naval vessel the terms of which provide for a substantial termination liability on the part of the United States,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">unless funds for that purpose have been specifically authorized by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Funds appropriated to the Department of Defense may not be used to indemnify any person under the terms of a contract entered into under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for any amount paid or due by any person to the United States for any liability arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to pay any attorneys&rsquo; fees in connection with such contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1)(A) In this section, the term &ldquo;long-term lease or charter&rdquo; (except as provided in subparagraph (B)) means a lease, charter, service contract, or conditional sale agreement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the term of which is for a period of five years or longer or more than one-half the useful life of the vessel or aircraft; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the initial term of which is for a period of less than five years but which contains an option to renew or extend the agreement for a period which, when added to the initial term (or any previous renewal or extension), is five years or longer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such term includes the extension or renewal of a lease or charter agreement if the term of the extension or renewal thereof is for a period of five years or longer or if the term of the lease or charter agreement being extended or renewed was for a period of five years or longer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of an agreement under which the lessor first places the property in service under the agreement or the property has been in service for less than one year and there is allowable to the lessor or charterer an investment tax credit or depreciation for the property leased, chartered, or otherwise provided under the agreement under section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (unless the lessor or charterer has elected depreciation on a straightline method for such property), the term &ldquo;long-term lease or charter&rdquo; means a lease, charter, service contract, or conditional sale agreement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the term of which is for a period of three years or longer; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the initial term of which is for a period of less than three years but which contains an option to renew or extend the agreement for a period which, when added to the initial term (or any previous renewal or extension), is three years or longer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such term includes the extension or renewal of a lease or charter agreement if the term of the extension or renewal thereof is for a period of three years or longer or if the term of the lease or charter agreement being extended or renewed was for a period of three years or longer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this section, the United States shall be considered to have a substantial termination liability under a contract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if there is an agreement by the United States under the contract to pay an amount not less than the amount equal to 25 percent of the value of the vessel or aircraft under lease or charter, calculated on the basis of the present value of the termination liability of the United States under such charter or lease <!-- PDFPage:916 -->(as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the present value of the amount of the termination liability of the United States under the contract as of the end of the term of the contract (exclusive of any option to extend the contract); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the present value of the total of the payments to be made by the United States under the contract (excluding any option to extend the contract) attributable to capital-hire,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">is more than one-half the price of the vessel or aircraft involved.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Whenever a request is submitted to Congress for the authorization of the long-term lease or charter of aircraft or naval vessels or for the authorization of a lease or charter of aircraft or naval vessels which provides for a substantial termination liability on the part of the United States, the Secretary of Defense shall submit with that request an analysis of the cost to the United States (including lost tax revenues) of any such lease or charter arrangement compared with the cost to the United States of direct procurement of the aircraft or naval vessels by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any such analysis shall be reviewed and evaluated by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of the Treasury within 30 days after the date on which the request and analysis are submitted to Congress. The Director and Secretary shall conduct such review and evaluation on the basis of the guidelines issued pursuant to subsection (f) and shall report to Congress in writing on the results of their review and evaluation at the earliest practicable date, but in no event more than 45 days after the date on which the request and analysis are submitted to the Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever a request is submitted to Congress for the authorization of funds for the Department of Defense for the long-term lease or charter of aircraft or naval vessels authorized under this section, the Secretary of Defense&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall indicate in the request what portion of the requested funds is attributable to capital-hire; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall reflect such portion in the appropriate procurement account in the request.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of the Treasury shall jointly issue guidelines for determining under what circumstances the Department of Defense may use lease or charter arrangements for aircraft and naval vessels rather than directly procuring such aircraft and vessels.</p>
