<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) For members separated with less than six years of active service, 60 days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For members separated with six or more years of active service, 120 days.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Conversion Health Policies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall inform each member referred to in subsection (a) before the date of the member's discharge or release from active duty of the availability for purchase by the member of a conversion health policy for the member and the dependents of that member. A conversion health policy offered under this paragraph shall provide coverage for not less than an 18-month period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a member referred to in subsection (a) purchases a conversion health policy during the period applicable to the member (or within a reasonable time after that period as prescribed by the Secretary of Defense), the Secretary shall provide health care, or pay the costs of health care provided, to the member and the dependents of the member&mdash;</p>

Subject to paragraph (5), a member purchasing a policy from the Secretary shall be required to pay into the Military Health Care Account or other appropriate account an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary concerned shall give special consideration to requests for such care in cases in which the condition for which treatment is required was incurred or aggravated by the member or the dependent before the date of the separation of the member, particularly if the condition is a result of the particular circumstances of the service of the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;conversion health policy&rdquo; means a health insurance policy with a private insurer, developed through negotiations between the Secretary of Defense and a private insurer, that is available for purchase by or for the use of a person who is no longer a member of the armed forces or a covered beneficiary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Coast Guard</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall implement this section for the Coast Guard.</p>
