<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;award&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;present&rdquo; to cover the determination of the recipient as well as the actual presenting of the decoration. The words &ldquo;but not in the name of Congress&rdquo; are omitted, since a decoration is presented in the name of Congress only if the law so directs. The words &ldquo;Navy or the Marine Corps&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;naval service of the United States&rdquo; for clarity. To be eligible for the award, a person need not be a member of the naval service, but only serving in some capacity either with the Navy or with the Marine Corps.</p>

<p class="note-body"><b>1963</b>&mdash;Pub. L. 88&ndash;77 enlarged the authority to award the Navy cross, which was limited to those cases in which persons distinguished themselves in connection with military operations against an armed enemy, to permit its award for extraordinary heroism not justifying the award of a medal of honor, while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States, while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force, or while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.</p>
