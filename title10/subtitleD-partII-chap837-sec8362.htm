<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under such regulations and in such number as he may prescribe, the Secretary of the Air Force, or such authority as he directs, shall from time to time appoint and convene selection boards to consider reserve commissioned officers for promotion under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Each board shall be composed of at least five members who are senior in regular or reserve grade to, and who outrank, any officer considered by that board. Five members of a board constitute a quorum. So far as practicable, at least one-half of the members of the board must be reserve officers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A board serves for as long as the Secretary of the Air Force prescribes but not longer than one year. A member may not serve on two consecutive boards for promotions to the same grade, if the second board considers any officers considered but not recommended for promotion by the first.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Each member of a board must swear that he will perform his duties without prejudice or partiality, having in view the special fitness of officers and the efficiency of the Air Force.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A recommendation for promotion must be made by the majority of the total membership of the board. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a board that is to recommend officers for promotion whom it considers to be the best qualified may recommend only those officers whom it also considers to be fully qualified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) An officer eligible for consideration for promotion by a board under this chapter is entitled to send a letter, through official channels, calling attention to any matter of record in the armed forces concerning himself that he considers important to his case. The letter may not criticize any officer or reflect on his character, conduct, or motives. A letter sent under this subsection may not be considered by a selection board unless it is received by the time the board convenes.</p>
