<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall require the Secretary of each military department, the head of each Defense Agency, and the head of each Department of Defense Field Activity to ensure that the decisions made by that official regarding consolidation of contract requirements of the department, agency, or field activity, as the case may be, are made with a view to providing small business concerns with appropriate opportunities to participate in Department of Defense procurements as prime contractors and appropriate opportunities to participate in such procurements as subcontractors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Use of Acquisition Strategies Involving Consolidation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An official of a military department, Defense Agency, or Department of Defense Field Activity may not execute an acquisition strategy that includes a consolidation of contract requirements of the military department, agency, or activity with a total value in excess of $5,000,000, unless the senior procurement executive concerned first&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) conducts market research;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) identifies any alternative contracting approaches that would involve a lesser degree of consolidation of contract requirements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) determines that the consolidation is necessary and justified.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A senior procurement executive may determine that an acquisition strategy involving a consolidation of contract requirements is necessary and justified for the purposes of paragraph (1) if the benefits of the acquisition strategy substantially exceed the benefits of each of the possible alternative contracting approaches identified under subparagraph (B) of that paragraph. However, savings in administrative or personnel costs alone do not constitute, for such purposes, a sufficient justification for a consolidation of contract requirements in a procurement unless the total amount of the cost savings is expected to be substantial in relation to the total cost of the procurement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Benefits considered for the purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2) may include cost and, regardless of whether quantifiable in dollar amounts&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) quality;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) acquisition cycle;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) terms and conditions; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The terms &ldquo;consolidation of contract requirements&rdquo; and &ldquo;consolidation&rdquo;, with respect to contract requirements of a military department, Defense Agency, or Department of Defense Field Activity, mean a use of a solicitation to obtain offers for a single contract <!-- PDFPage:1155 -->or a multiple award contract to satisfy two or more requirements of that department, agency, or activity for goods or services that have previously been provided to, or performed for, that department, agency, or activity under two or more separate contracts smaller in cost than the total cost of the contract for which the offers are solicited.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;multiple award contract&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a contract that is entered into by the Administrator of General Services under the multiple award schedule program referred to in section 2302(2)(C) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a multiple award task order contract or delivery order contract that is entered into under the authority of sections 2304a through 2304d of this title or sections 303H through 303K of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 253h through 253k); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any other indeterminate delivery, indeterminate quantity contract that is entered into by the head of a Federal agency with two or more sources pursuant to the same solicitation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;senior procurement executive concerned&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) with respect to a military department, the official designated under section 16(c) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 414(c)) as the senior procurement executive for the military department; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of the establishment or expansion of a military installation, assistance may be made under paragraph (1) only if (A) community impact assistance or special impact assistance is not otherwise available, and (B) the establishment or expansion involves the assignment to the installation of (i) more than 2,000 military, civilian, and contractor Department of Defense personnel, or (ii) more military, civilian, and contractor Department of Defense personnel than the number equal to 10 percent of the number of persons employed in counties or independent municipalities within fifteen miles of the installation, whichever is lesser.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Condition for Proceeding Beyond Low-Rate Initial Production</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall provide that a major defense acquisition program may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production until initial operational test and evaluation of the program is completed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In this subsection, the term &ldquo;major defense acquisition program&rdquo; means a conventional weapons system that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is a major system within the meaning of that term in section 2302(5) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is designed for use in combat.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Operational Test and Evaluation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Operational testing of a major defense acquisition program may not be conducted until the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation of the Department of Defense approves (in writing) the adequacy of the plans (including the projected level of funding) for operational test and evaluation to be conducted in connection with that program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Director shall analyze the results of the operational test and evaluation conducted for each major defense acquisition program. At the conclusion of such testing, the Director shall prepare a report stating&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the opinion of the Director as to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) whether the test and evaluation performed were adequate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) whether the results of such test and evaluation confirm that the items or components actually tested are effective and suitable for combat; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) additional information on the operational capabilities of the items or components that the Director considers appropriate based on the testing conducted.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Director shall submit each report under paragraph (2) to the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, and the congressional defense committees. Each such report shall be submitted to those committees in precisely the same form and with precisely the same content as the report originally was submitted to the Secretary and Under Secretary and shall be accompanied by such comments as the Secretary may wish to make on the report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A final decision within the Department of Defense to proceed with a major defense acquisition program beyond low-rate initial production may not be made until the Director has submitted to the Secretary of Defense the report with respect to that program under paragraph (2) and the congressional defense committees have received that report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If, before a final decision described in paragraph (4) is made for a major defense acquisition program, a decision is made within the Department of Defense to proceed to operational use of that program or to make procurement funds available for that program, the Director shall submit to the Secretary of Defense and the congressional defense committees the report with respect to that program under paragraph (2) as soon as practicable after the decision described in this paragraph is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In this subsection, the term &ldquo;major defense acquisition program&rdquo; has the meaning given that term in section 139(a)(2)(B) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Determination of Quantity of Articles Required for Operational Testing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The quantity of articles of a new system that are to be procured for operational testing shall be determined by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation of the Department of Defense, in the case of a new system that is a major defense acquisition program (as defined in section 139(a)(2)(B) of this title); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the operational test and evaluation agency of the military department concerned, in the case of a new system that is not a major defense acquisition program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1169 --><p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Impartiality of Contractor Testing Personnel</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of a major defense acquisition program (as defined in subsection (a)(2)), no person employed by the contractor for the system being tested may be involved in the conduct of the operational test and evaluation required under subsection (a). The limitation in the preceding sentence does not apply to the extent that the Secretary of Defense plans for persons employed by that contractor to be involved in the operation, maintenance, and support of the system being tested when the system is deployed in combat.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Impartial Contracted Advisory and Assistance Services</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Director may not contract with any person for advisory and assistance services with regard to the test and evaluation of a system if that person participated in (or is participating in) the development, production, or testing of such system for a military department or Defense Agency (or for another contractor of the Department of Defense).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Director may waive the limitation under paragraph (1) in any case if the Director determines in writing that sufficient steps have been taken to ensure the impartiality of the contractor in providing the services. The Inspector General of the Department of Defense shall review each such waiver and shall include in the Inspector General's semi-annual report an assessment of those waivers made since the last such report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) A contractor that has participated in (or is participating in) the development, production, or testing of a system for a military department or Defense Agency (or for another contractor of the Department of Defense) may not be involved (in any way) in the establishment of criteria for data collection, performance assessment, or evaluation activities for the operational test and evaluation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The limitation in subparagraph (A) does not apply to a contractor that has participated in such development, production, or testing solely in testing for the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Source of Funds for Testing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The costs for all tests required under subsection (a) shall be paid from funds available for the system being tested.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Director's Annual Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As part of the annual report of the Director under section 139 of this title, the Director shall describe for each program covered in the report the status of test and evaluation activities in comparison with the test and evaluation master plan for that program, as approved by the Director. The Director shall include in such annual report a description of each waiver granted under subsection (e)(2) since the last such report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Operational Test and Evaluation Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;operational test and evaluation&rdquo; has the meaning given that term in section 139(a)(2)(A) of this title. For purposes of subsection (a), that term does not include an operational assessment based exclusively on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) computer modeling;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) simulation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an analysis of system requirements, engineering proposals, design specifications, or any other information contained in program documents.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Secretary of a military department may make a contract for the lease of a vessel, aircraft, or combat vehicle or for the provision of a service through use by a contractor of a vessel, aircraft, or combat vehicle only as provided in subsection (b) if&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of a military department may make a contract that is an agreement to lease or charter or an agreement to provide services and that is (or will be) accompanied by a contract for the actual lease, charter, or provision of services only as provided in subsection (b) if the contract for the actual lease, charter, or provision of services is (or will be) a contract described in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary may make a contract described in subsection (a)(1) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary has been specifically authorized by law to make the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) before a solicitation for proposals for the contract was issued the Secretary notified the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives of the Secretary's intention to issue such a solicitation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary has notified those committees of the proposed contract and provided a detailed description of the terms of the proposed contract and a justification for entering into the proposed contract rather than providing for the lease, charter, or services involved through purchase of the vessel, aircraft, or combat vehicle to be used under the contract, and a period of 30 days of continuous session of Congress has expired following the date on which notice was received by such committees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the Secretary has certified to those committees&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) that entering into the proposed contract as a means of obtaining the vessel, aircraft, or combat vehicle is the most cost-effective means of obtaining such vessel, aircraft, or combat vehicle; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) that the Secretary has determined that the lease complies with all applicable laws, Office of Management and Budget circulars, and Department of Defense regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(C), the continuity of a session of Congress is broken only by an adjournment of the Congress sine die, and the days on which either House is not in session because of an adjournment of more than three days to a day certain are excluded in a computation of such 30-day period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon receipt of a notice under paragraph (1)(C), a committee identified in paragraph (1)(B) may request the Inspector General of the Department of Defense or the Comptroller General of the United States to conduct a review of the proposed contract to determine whether or not such contract meets the requirements of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If a review is requested under paragraph (3), the Inspector General of the Department of Defense or the Comptroller General of the United States, as the case may be, shall submit to the Secretary and the congressional defense committees a report on such review before the expiration of the period specified in paragraph (1)(C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Funds may not be appropriated for any fiscal year to or for any armed force or obligated or expended for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the long-term lease or charter of any aircraft, naval vessel, or combat vehicle; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for the lease or charter of any aircraft, naval vessel, or combat vehicle the terms of which provide for a substantial termination liability on the part of the United States,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">unless funds for that purpose have been specifically authorized by law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to pay any attorneys&rsquo; fees in connection with such contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the term of which is for a period of five years or longer or more than one-half the useful life of the vessel, aircraft, or combat vehicle; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the initial term of which is for a period of less than five years but which contains an option to renew or extend the agreement for a period which, when added to the initial term (or any previous renewal or extension), is five years or longer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such term includes the extension or renewal of a lease or charter agreement if the term of the extension or renewal thereof is for a period of five years or longer or if the term of the lease or <!-- PDFPage:1172 -->charter agreement being extended or renewed was for a period of five years or longer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of an agreement under which the lessor first places the property in service under the agreement or the property has been in service for less than one year and there is allowable to the lessor or charterer an investment tax credit or depreciation for the property leased, chartered, or otherwise provided under the agreement under section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (unless the lessor or charterer has elected depreciation on a straightline method for such property), the term &ldquo;long-term lease or charter&rdquo; means a lease, charter, service contract, or conditional sale agreement&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if there is an agreement by the United States under the contract to pay an amount not less than the amount equal to 25 percent of the value of the vessel, aircraft, or combat vehicle under lease or charter, calculated on the basis of the present value of the termination liability of the United States under such charter or lease (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the present value of the amount of the termination liability of the United States under the contract as of the end of the term of the contract (exclusive of any option to extend the contract); and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">is more than one-half the price of the vessel, aircraft, or combat vehicle involved.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Whenever a request is submitted to Congress for the authorization of the long-term lease or charter of aircraft, naval vessels, or combat vehicles or for the authorization of a lease or charter of aircraft, naval vessels, or combat vehicles which provides for a substantial termination liability on the part of the United States, the Secretary of Defense shall submit with that request an analysis of the cost to the United States (including lost tax revenues) of any such lease or charter arrangement compared with the cost to the United States of direct procurement of the aircraft, naval vessels, or combat vehicles by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any such analysis shall be reviewed and evaluated by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of the Treasury within 30 days after the date on which the request and analysis are submitted to Congress. The Director and Secretary shall conduct such review and evaluation on the basis of the guidelines issued pursuant to subsection (f) and shall report to Congress in writing on the results of their review and evaluation at the earliest practicable date, but in no event more than 45 days after the date on which the request and analysis are submitted to the Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever a request is submitted to Congress for the authorization of funds for the Department of Defense for the long-term lease or charter of aircraft, naval vessels, or combat vehicles authorized under this section, the Secretary of Defense&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall indicate in the request what portion of the requested funds is attributable to capital-hire; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall reflect such portion in the appropriate procurement account in the request.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) If a lease or charter covered by this section is a capital lease or a lease-purchase&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the lease or charter shall be treated as an acquisition and shall be subject to all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for the acquisition of aircraft, naval vessels, or combat vehicles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) funds appropriated to the Department of Defense for operation and maintenance may not be obligated or expended for the lease or charter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In this subsection, the terms &ldquo;capital lease&rdquo; and &ldquo;lease-purchase&rdquo; have the meanings given those terms in Appendix B to Office of Management and Budget Circular A&ndash;11, as in effect on the date of the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of the Treasury shall jointly issue guidelines for determining under what circumstances the Department of Defense may use lease or charter arrangements for aircraft, naval vessels, and combat vehicles rather than directly procuring such aircraft, vessels, and combat vehicles.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:1177 --><p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) An agreement between the contractor in a contract for the acquisition of commercial items and a subcontractor under such contract that restricts sales by such subcontractor directly to persons other than the contractor may not be considered to unreasonably restrict sales by that subcontractor to the United States in violation of the provision included in such contract pursuant to subsection (a) if the agreement does not result in the United States being treated differently with regard to the restriction than any other prospective purchaser of such commercial items from that subcontractor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; has the meaning given such term in section 4(12) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403(12)).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Investigation of Complaints</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person who believes that the person has been subjected to a reprisal prohibited by subsection (a) may submit a complaint to the Inspector General of an agency. Unless the Inspector General determines that the complaint is frivolous, the Inspector General shall investigate the complaint and, upon completion of such investigation, submit a report of the findings of the investigation to the person, the contractor concerned, and the head of the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Remedy and Enforcement Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the head of the agency determines that a contractor has subjected a person to a reprisal prohibited by subsection (a), the head of the agency may take one or more of the following actions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Order the contractor to take affirmative action to abate the reprisal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Order the contractor to reinstate the person to the position that the person held before the reprisal, together with the compensation (including back pay), employment benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment that would apply to the person in that position if the reprisal had not been taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Order the contractor to pay the complainant an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees and expert witnesses&rsquo; fees) that were reasonably incurred by the complainant for, or in connection with, bringing the complaint regarding the reprisal, as determined by the head of the agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever a person fails to comply with an order issued under paragraph (1), the head of the agency shall file an action for enforcement of such order in the United States district court for a district in which the reprisal was found to have occurred. In any action brought under this paragraph, the court may grant appropriate relief, including injunctive relief and compensatory and exemplary damages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued under paragraph (1) may obtain review of the order's conformance with this subsection, and any regulations issued to carry out this section, in the United States court of appeals for a circuit in which the reprisal is alleged in the order to have occurred. No petition seeking such review may be filed more than 60 days after issuance of the order by the head of the agency. Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Construction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section may be construed to authorize the discharge of, demotion of, or discrimination against an employee for a disclosure other than a disclosure protected by subsection (a) or to modify or derogate from a right or remedy otherwise available to the employee.</p>
