<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Reuse Studies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the military department concerned publicly announces that a military installation is a candidate for closure or that a final decision has been made to close a military installation and the Secretary of Defense determines, because of the location, facilities, or other particular characteristics of the installation, that the installation may be suitable for some specific Federal, State, or local use potentially beneficial to the Nation, the Secretary of Defense may conduct such studies, including the preparation of an environmental impact statement in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), in connection with such installation and such potential use as may be necessary to provide information sufficient to make sound conclusions and recommendations regarding the possible use of the installation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Adjustment and Diversification Assistance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense may make grants, conclude cooperative agreements, and supplement funds available under Federal programs administered by agencies other than the <!-- PDFPage:872 -->Department of Defense in order to assist State and local governments in planning community adjustments and economic diversification required (A) by the proposed or actual establishment, realignment, or closure of a military installation, (B) by the cancellation or termination of a Department of Defense contract or the failure to proceed with an approved major weapon system program, (C) by a publicly announced planned major reduction in Department of Defense spending that would directly and adversely affect a community, (D) by the encroachment of a civilian community on a military installation, or (E) by the closure or the significantly reduced operations of a defense facility as the result of the merger, acquisition, or consolidation of the defense contractor operating the defense facility, if the Secretary determines that an action described in clause (A), (B), (C), or (E) is likely to have a direct and significantly adverse consequence on the affected community or, in the case of an action described in clause (D), if the Secretary determines that the encroachment of the civilian community is likely to impair the continued operational utility of the military installation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of the establishment or expansion of a military installation, assistance may be made under paragraph (1) only if (A) community impact assistance or special impact assistance is not otherwise available, and (B) the establishment or expansion involves the assignment to the installation of (i) more than 2,000 military, civilian, and contractor Department of Defense personnel, or (ii) more military, civilian, and contractor Department of Defense personnel than the number equal to 10 percent of the number of persons employed in counties or independent municipalities within fifteen miles of the installation, whichever is lesser.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of a publicly announced planned reduction in Department of Defense spending, the closure or significantly reduced operations of a defense facility, the cancellation or termination of a Department of Defense contract, or the failure to proceed with a previously approved major defense acquisition program, assistance may be made under paragraph (1) only if the reduction, cancellation, termination, or failure will have a direct and significant adverse impact on a community and will result in the loss of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 2,500 or more employee positions, in the case of a Metropolitan Statistical Area or similar area (as defined by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget);</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) one percent of the total number of civilian jobs in that area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) In the case of a State or local government eligible for assistance under paragraph (1), the Secretary of Defense may also make grants, conclude cooperative agreements, and supplement other Federal funds in order to assist the State or local government to carry out a community adjustment and economic diversification program (including State industrial extension or modernization efforts to facilitate the economic diversification of defense contractors and subcontractors) in addition to planning such a program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall establish criteria for the selection of community adjustment and economic diversification programs to receive assistance under subparagraph (A). Such criteria shall include a requirement that the State or local government agree&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to provide not less than 10 percent of the funding for the program from non-Federal sources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to provide business planning and market exploration services under the program to defense contractors and subcontractors that seek modernization or diversification assistance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) to provide training, counseling, and placement services for members of the armed forces and dislocated defense workers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall carry out this paragraph in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The Secretary of Defense may also make grants, conclude cooperative agreements, and supplement other Federal funds in order to assist a State or local government in planning community adjustments and economic diversification even though the State or local government is not currently eligible for assistance under paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines that a substantial portion of the economic activity or population of the geographic area to be subject to the advance planning is dependent on defense expenditures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary of Defense may also make grants, conclude cooperative agreements, and supplement other Federal funds in order to assist a State in enhancing its capacities&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to assist communities, businesses, and workers adversely affected by an action described in paragraph (1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to support local adjustment and diversification initiatives; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) to stimulate cooperation between statewide and local adjustment and diversification efforts.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2393. Prohibition against doing business with certain offerors or contractors</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary of a military department may not solicit an offer from, award a contract to, extend an existing contract with, or, when approval by the Secretary of the award of a subcontract is required, approve the award of a subcontract to, an offeror or contractor which to the Secretary's knowledge has been debarred or suspended by another Federal agency unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of debarment, the debarment of the offeror or contractor by all other agencies has been terminated or the period of time specified for such debarment has expired; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a suspension, the period of time specified by all other agencies for the suspension of the offeror or contractor has expired.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply in any case in which the Secretary concerned determines that there is a compelling reason to solicit an offer from, award a contract to, extend a contract with, or approve a subcontract with such offeror or contractor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Whenever the Secretary concerned makes a determination described in subsection (a)(2), he shall, at the time of the determination, transmit a notice to the Administrator of General Services describing the determination. The Administrator of General Services shall maintain each such notice in a file available for public inspection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;debar&rdquo; means to exclude, pursuant to established administrative procedures, from Government contracting and subcontracting for a specified period of time commensurate with the seriousness of the failure or offense or the inadequacy of performance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;suspend&rdquo; means to disqualify, pursuant to established administrative procedures, from Government contracting and subcontracting for a temporary period of time because a concern or individual is suspected of engaging in criminal, fraudulent, or seriously improper conduct.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe in regulations a requirement that each contractor under contract with the Department of Defense shall require each contractor to whom it awards a contract (in this section referred to as a subcontractor) to disclose to the contractor whether the subcontractor is or is not, as of the time of the award of the subcontract, debarred or suspended by the Federal Government from Government contracting or subcontracting. The requirement shall apply to any subcontractor whose subcontract is in an amount greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 4(11) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403(11))). The requirement shall not apply in the case of a subcontract for the acquisition of commercial items (as defined in section 4(12) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403(12))).</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of a military department may make a contract that is an agreement to lease or charter or an agreement to provide services and that is (or will be) accompanied by a contract for the actual lease, charter, or provision of services only as provided in subsection (b) if the contract for the actual lease, charter, or provision of services is (or will be) a contract described in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary may make a contract described in subsection (a)(1) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary has been specifically authorized by law to make the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) before a solicitation for proposals for the contract was issued the Secretary notified the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on National Security and the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives of the Secretary's intention to issue such a solicitation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary has notified those committees of the proposed contract and provided a detailed description of the terms of the proposed contract and a justification for entering into the proposed contract rather than providing for the lease, charter, or services involved through purchase of the vessel or aircraft to be used under the contract, and a period of 30 days of continuous session of Congress has expired following the date on which notice was received by such committees.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(C), the continuity of a session of Congress is broken only by an adjournment of the Congress sine die, and the days on which either House is not in session because of an adjournment of more than three days to a day certain are excluded in a computation of such 30-day period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Funds may not be appropriated for any fiscal year to or for any armed force or obligated or expended for&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the term of which is for a period of three years or longer; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the initial term of which is for a period of less than three years but which contains an option to renew or extend the agreement for a period which, when added to the initial term (or any previous renewal or extension), is three years or longer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such term includes the extension or renewal of a lease or charter agreement if the term of the extension or renewal thereof is for a period of three years or longer or if the term of the lease or charter agreement being extended or renewed was for a period of three years or longer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">is more than one-half the price of the vessel or aircraft involved.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Whenever a request is submitted to Congress for the authorization of the long-term lease or charter of aircraft or naval vessels or for the authorization of a lease or charter of aircraft or naval vessels which provides for a substantial termination liability on the part of the United States, the Secretary of Defense shall submit with that request an analysis of the cost to the United States (including lost tax revenues) of any such lease or charter arrangement compared with the cost to the United States of direct procurement of the aircraft or naval vessels by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any such analysis shall be reviewed and evaluated by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of the Treasury within 30 days after the date on which the request and analysis are submitted to Congress. The Director and Secretary shall conduct such review and evaluation on the basis of the guidelines issued pursuant to subsection (f) and shall report to Congress in writing on the results of their review and evaluation at the earliest practicable date, but in no event more than 45 days after the date on which the request and analysis are submitted to the Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever a request is submitted to Congress for the authorization of funds for the Department of Defense for the long-term lease or charter of aircraft or naval vessels authorized under this section, the Secretary of Defense&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition of Reprisals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An employee of a contractor may not be discharged, demoted, or otherwise discriminated against as a reprisal for disclosing to a Member of Congress or an authorized official of an agency or the Department of Justice information relating to a substantial violation of law related to a contract (including the competition for or negotiation of a contract).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Investigation of Complaints</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person who believes that the person has been subjected to a reprisal prohibited by subsection (a) may submit a complaint to the Inspector General of an agency. Unless the Inspector General determines that the complaint is frivolous, the Inspector General shall investigate the complaint and, upon completion of such investigation, submit a report of the findings of the investigation to the person, the contractor concerned, and the head of the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Remedy and Enforcement Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the head of the agency determines that a contractor has subjected a person to a reprisal prohibited by subsection (a), the head of the agency may take one or more of the following actions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Order the contractor to take affirmative action to abate the reprisal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Order the contractor to reinstate the person to the position that the person held before the reprisal, together with the compensation (including back pay), employment benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment that would apply to the person in that position if the reprisal had not been taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Order the contractor to pay the complainant an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees and expert witnesses&rsquo; fees) that were reasonably incurred by the complainant for, or in connection with, bringing the complaint regarding the reprisal, as determined by the head of the agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever a person fails to comply with an order issued under paragraph (1), the head of the agency shall file an action for enforcement of such order in the United States district court for a district in which the reprisal was found to have occurred. In any action brought under this paragraph, the court may grant appropriate relief, including injunctive relief and compensatory and exemplary damages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued under paragraph (1) may obtain review of the order's conformance with this subsection, and any regulations issued to carry out this section, in the United States court of appeals for a circuit in which the reprisal is alleged in the order to have occurred. No petition seeking such review may be filed more than 60 days after issuance of the order by the head of the agency. Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Construction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section may be construed to authorize the discharge of, demotion of, or discrimination against an employee for a disclosure other than a disclosure protected by subsection (a) or to modify or derogate from a right or remedy otherwise available to the employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section:</p>
