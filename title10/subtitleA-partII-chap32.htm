<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section is based on Pub. L. 95&ndash;79, title VIII, &sect;811(a), July 30, 1977, 91 Stat. 335, as amended by Pub. L. 96&ndash;107, title VIII, &sect;817, Nov. 9, 1979, 93 Stat. 818; Pub. L. 96&ndash;342, title X, &sect;1003, Sept. 8, 1980, 94 Stat. 1120; Pub. L. 97&ndash;86, title VI, &sect;602, Dec. 1, 1981, 95 Stat. 1110.</p>
<p class="note-body">Present law (section 811(a) of Public Law 95&ndash;79, as amended) provides that the authority to suspend the <!-- PDFPage:204 -->limitation on the number of general and flag officers who may be serving on active duty applies during war or national emergency. In codifying the limitation (in section 526 of title 10 as proposed to be added by section 1(b) of the bill), the committee determined that the same war and emergency waiver authority as applies to other limitations on the number of officers on active duty under the existing 10 U.S.C. 526 (redesignated as 10 U.S.C. 527 by the bill) should apply with respect to this limitation and accordingly amended the suspension authority in present law to include the codified general and flag officer limitation. This authority is slightly different from the waiver authority in the source law in that the suspension would expire 2 years after it takes effect or 1 year after the end of the war or national emergency, whichever occurs first, rather than upon termination of the war or emergency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In time of war, or of national emergency declared by Congress or the President after November 30, 1980, the President may suspend the operation of any provision of section 523, 525, or 526 of this title. So long as such war or national emergency continues, any such suspension may be extended by the President. Any such suspension shall, if not sooner ended, end on the last day of the two-year period beginning on the date on which the suspension (or the last extension thereof) takes effect or on the last day of the one-year period beginning on the date of the termination of the war or national emergency, whichever occurs first. With respect to the end of any such suspension, the preceding sentence supersedes the provisions of title II of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1621&ndash;1622) which provide that powers or authorities exercised by reason of a national emergency shall cease to be exercised after the date of the termination of the emergency.</p>
