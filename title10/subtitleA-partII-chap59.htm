If he is not eligible for retirement under any provision of law, but since the date when he accepted his original permanent appointment as a regular warrant officer he has at least three years of active service that could be credited to him under section 511 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, as amended (70 Stat. 114), he shall, if eligible therefor, be separated with separation pay under section 1174 of this title or severance pay under section 286a of title 14, as appropriate. However, instead of being paid separation pay or severance pay he may be enlisted under section 515 of this title. If he does not have three years of such service, he shall be separated under section 1165 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary concerned may defer, for not more than four months, the retirement or separation under subsection (a) of any warrant officer if, because of unavoidable circumstances, evaluation of his physical condition and determination of his entitlement to retirement or separation for physical disability require hospitalization or medical observation that cannot be completed before the date when he would otherwise be required to be retired or separated under this section.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Consistent with this section and the availability of appropriations for this purpose, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation may provide a financial incentive to members of the armed forces described in subsection (b) for voluntary appointment, enlistment, or transfer to a reserve component, requested and approved under subsection (c), for the period of time the member serves in a reserve component.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation may provide the incentive to a member of the armed forces if the member&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has served on active duty or full-time National Guard duty or any combination of active duty and full-time National Guard duty for more than 6 but less than 20 years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has served at least 5 years of continuous active duty or full-time National Guard duty or any combination of active duty and full-time National Guard duty immediately preceding the date of separation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) meets such other requirements as the Secretary may prescribe from time to time, which may include requirements relating to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) years of service;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) grade or rank; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) remaining period of obligated service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A member of the armed forces offered a voluntary separation incentive under this section shall be offered the opportunity to request separation under a program established pursuant to section 1174a of this title. If the Secretary concerned approves a request for separation under either such section, the member shall be separated under the authority of the section selected by such member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) A member of the armed forces described in subsection (b) may request voluntary appointment, enlistment, or transfer to a reserve component accompanied by this incentive, provided the member has completed 6 years of active service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary, in his discretion, may approve or disapprove a request according to the needs of the armed forces.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) After September 30, 1999, the Secretary may not approve a request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) The annual payment of the incentive shall equal 2.5 percent of the monthly basic pay the member receives on the date appointed, enlisted, or transferred to the reserve component, multiplied by twelve and multiplied again by the member's years of service. The annual payment will be made for a period equal to the number of years that is equal to twice the number of years of service of the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A member entitled to voluntary separation incentive payments who is also entitled to basic pay for active or reserve service, or compensation for inactive duty training, may elect to have a reduction in the voluntary separation incentive payable for the same period in an amount not to exceed the amount of the basic pay or compensation received for that period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A member who has received the voluntary separation incentive and who qualifies for retired or retainer pay under this title shall have deducted from each payment of such retired or retainer pay so much of such pay as is based on the service for which he received the voluntary separation incentive until the total amount deducted equals the total amount of voluntary separation incentive received. If the member elected to have a reduction in voluntary separation incentive for any period pursuant to paragraph (2), the deduction required under the preceding sentence shall be reduced accordingly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A member who is receiving voluntary separation incentive payments shall not be deprived of this incentive by reason of entitlement to disability compensation under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, but there shall be deducted from voluntary separation incentive payments an amount equal to the amount of any such disability compensation concurrently received. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no deduction may be made from voluntary separation incentive payments for any disability compensation received because of an earlier period of active duty if the voluntary separation incentive is received because of discharge or release from a later period of active duty.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:469 --><p class="statutory-body">(5) The years of service of a member for purposes of this section shall be computed in accordance with section 1405 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The member's right to incentive payments shall not be transferable, except that the member may designate beneficiaries to receive the payments in the event of the member's death.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Department of Defense Retirement Board of Actuaries (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) shall perform the same functions regarding the Fund, as provided in this subsection, as such Board performs regarding the Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Not later than January 1, 1993, the Board shall determine the amount that is the present value, as of that date, of the future benefits payable under this section in the case of persons who are separated pursuant to this section before that date. The amount so determined is the original unfunded liability of the Fund. The Board shall determine an appropriate amortization period and schedule for liquidation of the original unfunded liability. The Secretary shall make deposits to the Fund in accordance with that amortization schedule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) For persons separated under this section on or after January 1, 1993, the Secretary shall deposit in the Fund during the period beginning on that date and ending on September 30, 1999&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) carry out an actuarial valuation of the Fund and determine any unfunded liability of the Fund which deposits under paragraphs (5) and (6) do not liquidate, taking into consideration any cumulative actuarial gain or loss to the Fund;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) determine the period over which that unfunded liability should be liquidated; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) determine for the following fiscal year, the total amount, and the monthly amount, of the Department of Defense contributions that must be made to the Fund during that fiscal year in order to fund the unfunded liabilities of the Fund over the applicable amortization periods.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Board shall carry out its responsibilities for each fiscal year in sufficient time for the amounts referred to in subparagraph (A)(iii) to be included in budget requests for that fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary of Defense shall pay into the Fund at the end of each month as the Department of Defense contribution to the Fund the amount necessary to liquidate unfunded liabilities of the Fund in accordance with the amortization schedules determined by the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Amounts paid into the Fund under this subsection shall be paid from funds available for the pay of members of the armed forces under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of each military department.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(i) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation may issue such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this section.</p>
