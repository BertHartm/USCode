<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall require the Secretary of each military department, the head of each Defense Agency, and the head of each Department of Defense Field Activity to ensure that the decisions made by that official regarding consolidation of contract requirements of the department, agency, or field activity, as the case may be, are made with a view to providing small business concerns with appropriate opportunities to participate in Department of Defense procurements as prime contractors and appropriate opportunities to participate in such procurements as subcontractors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Use of Acquisition Strategies Involving Consolidation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An official of a military department, Defense Agency, or Department of Defense Field Activity may not execute an acquisition strategy that includes a consolidation of contract requirements of the military department, agency, or activity with a total value in excess of $5,000,000, unless the senior procurement executive concerned first&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) conducts market research;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) identifies any alternative contracting approaches that would involve a lesser degree of consolidation of contract requirements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) determines that the consolidation is necessary and justified.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A senior procurement executive may determine that an acquisition strategy involving a consolidation of contract requirements is necessary and justified for the purposes of paragraph (1) if the benefits of the acquisition strategy substantially exceed the benefits of each of the possible alternative contracting approaches identified under subparagraph (B) of that paragraph. However, savings in administrative or personnel costs alone do not constitute, for such purposes, a sufficient justification for a consolidation of contract requirements in a procurement unless the total amount of the cost savings is expected to be substantial in relation to the total cost of the procurement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Benefits considered for the purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2) may include cost and, regardless of whether quantifiable in dollar amounts&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) quality;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) acquisition cycle;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) terms and conditions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) any other benefit.</p>
