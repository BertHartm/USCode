<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Authority for Military Commissions Under This Chapter</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The President is authorized to establish military commissions under this chapter for offenses triable by military commission as provided in this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Construction of Provisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The procedures for military commissions set forth in this chapter are based upon the procedures for trial by general courts-martial under chapter 47 of this title (the Uniform Code of Military Justice). Chapter 47 of this title does not, by its terms, apply to trial by military commission except as specifically provided therein or in this chapter, and many of the provisions of chapter 47 of this title are by their terms inapplicable to military commissions. The judicial construction and application of chapter 47 of this title, while instructive, is therefore not of its own force binding on military commissions established under this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Section 832 (article 32 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), relating to pretrial investigation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Other provisions of chapter 47 of this title shall apply to trial by military commission under this chapter only to the extent provided by the terms of such provisions or by this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Geneva Conventions Not Establishing Private Right of Action</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No alien unprivileged enemy belligerent subject to trial by military commission under this chapter may invoke the Geneva Conventions as a basis for a private right of action.</p>
