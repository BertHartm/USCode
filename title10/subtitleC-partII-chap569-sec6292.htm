<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;member&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;naval service&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;Navy, Marine Corps, and the Reserve components thereof&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;form of&rdquo; are added for clarity. Reference to the date &ldquo;September 24, 1945&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;is entitled to&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;shall be furnished&rdquo; for uniformity. The decision of the Comptroller General of December 23, 1949 (B&ndash;91297), has not been overlooked. That decision, without passing on a case in which the point was involved, indicated that the transportation entitlement in 34 U.S.C. 900a might be impliedly repealed by the Career Compensation Act of 1949. The editors of the United States Code Annotated, apparently on the basis of this decision, have omitted 34 U.S.C.A. 900a from the 1954 pocket part. A conclusion that the section is repealed, however, defeats the specific purpose of the provision, which, as indicated in the legislative hearings, was to insure that underage dischargees would be transported home and not simply released at the place of discharge.</p>
