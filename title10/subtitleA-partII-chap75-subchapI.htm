<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, the Armed Forces Medical Examiner may conduct a forensic pathology investigation to determine the cause or manner of death of a deceased person if such an investigation is determined to be justified under circumstances described in subsection (b). The investigation may include an autopsy of the decedent's remains.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Basis for Investigation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A forensic pathology investigation of a death under this section is justified if at least one of the circumstances in paragraph (2) and one of the circumstances in paragraph (3) exist.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) there is reasonable suspicion that the death was by unlawful means;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) it appears that the death resulted from an infectious disease or from the effects of a hazardous material that may have an adverse effect on the military installation or community involved; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the identity of the decedent is unknown.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A circumstance under this paragraph is a circumstance under which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in any other authorized investigation being conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board, or any other Federal agency, an authorized official of such agency with authority to direct a forensic pathology investigation requests that the Armed Forces Medical Examiner conduct such an investigation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Determination of Justification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the determination that a circumstance exists under paragraph (2) of subsection (b) shall be made by the Armed Forces Medical Examiner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A commander may make the determination that a circumstance exists under paragraph (2) of subsection (b) and require a forensic pathology investigation under this section without regard to a determination made by the Armed Forces Medical Examiner if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in a case involving circumstances described in paragraph (3)(A)(i) of that subsection, the commander is the commander of the installation where the decedent was found dead or died; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in a case involving circumstances described in paragraph (3)(A)(ii) of that subsection, the commander is the commander of the decedent's unit at a level in the chain of command designated for such purpose in the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Limitation in Concurrent Jurisdiction Cases</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The exercise of authority under this section is subject to the exercise of primary jurisdiction for the investigation of a death&mdash;</p>
