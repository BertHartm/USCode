<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the readiness reporting system is applied uniformly throughout the Department of Defense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that information in the readiness reporting system is continually updated, with (A) any change in the overall readiness status of a unit that is required to be reported as part of the readiness reporting system being reported within 24 hours of the event necessitating the change in readiness status, and (B) any change in the overall readiness status of an element of the training establishment or an element of defense infrastructure that is required to be reported as part of the readiness reporting system being reported within 72 hours of the event necessitating the change in readiness status; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that sufficient resources are provided to establish and maintain the system so as to allow reporting of changes in readiness status as required by this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Measure, on a quarterly basis, the extent to which units of the armed forces remove serviceable parts, supplies, or equipment from one vehicle, vessel, or aircraft in order to render a different vehicle, vessel, or aircraft operational.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Quarterly and Monthly Joint Readiness Reviews</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Chairman shall incorporate into both the joint readiness review required under paragraph (1)(A) and the monthly review required under paragraph (1)(B) the current information derived from the readiness reporting system and shall assess the capability of the armed forces to execute their wartime missions based upon their posture at the time the review is conducted. The Chairman shall submit to the Secretary of Defense the results of each review under paragraph (1), including the deficiencies in readiness identified during that review.</p>

Each such report shall be submitted in unclassified form and may, as the Secretary determines necessary, also be submitted in classified form.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section. In those regulations, the Secretary shall prescribe the units that are subject to reporting in the readiness reporting system, what type of equipment is subject to such reporting, and the elements of the training establishment and of defense infrastructure that are subject to such reporting.</p>
