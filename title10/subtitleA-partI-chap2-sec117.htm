<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Quarterly and Monthly Joint Readiness Reviews</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) on a quarterly basis, conduct a joint readiness review; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Submission to Congressional Committees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall each quarter submit to the congressional defense committees a report in writing containing the results of the most recent joint readiness review under subsection (d)(1)(A), including the current information derived from the readiness reporting system. Each such report shall be submitted in unclassified form and may, as the Secretary determines necessary, also be submitted in classified form.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section.
