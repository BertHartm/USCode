<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Authority provided by law to improve existing military family housing units and ancillary family housing support facilities is authority to make alterations, additions, expansions, and extensions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In this section, the term &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; includes rehabilitation of a housing unit and maintenance or repair work to be accomplished concurrently with an improvement project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Funds may not be expended for the improvement of any single family housing unit, or for the improvement of two or more housing units that are to be converted into or are to be used as a single family housing unit, if the cost per unit of such improvement will exceed (A) $50,000 multiplied by the area construction cost index as developed by the Department of Defense for the location concerned at the time of contract award, or (B) in the case of improvements necessary to make the unit suitable for habitation by a handicapped person, $60,000 multiplied by such index. The Secretary concerned may waive the limitations contained in the preceding sentence if (i) such Secretary determines that, considering the useful life of the structure to be improved and the useful life of a newly <!-- PDFPage:996 -->constructed unit and the cost of construction and of operation and maintenance of each kind of unit over its useful life, the improvement will be cost-effective, and (ii) a period of 21 days elapses after the date on which the Committees on Armed Services and the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and of the House of Representatives receive a notice from such Secretary of the proposed waiver, together with an economic analysis demonstrating that the improvement will be cost effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the applicability of the limitation contained in paragraph (1), there shall be included as part of the cost of the improvement the cost of repairs undertaken in connection with the improvement and any cost in connection with (A) the furnishing of electricity, gas, water and sewage disposal, (B) the construction or repair of roads and walks, and (C) grading and drainage work.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The limitation contained in the first sentence of paragraph (1) does not apply to a project for the improvement of a family housing unit or units referred to in that sentence if the project (including the amount requested for the project) is identified in the budget materials submitted to Congress by the Secretary of Defense in connection with the submission to Congress of the budget for a fiscal year pursuant to section 1105 of title 31.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Secretary concerned may construct replacement military family housing units in lieu of improving existing military family housing units if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the improvement of the existing housing units has been authorized by law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary determines that the improvement project is no longer cost-effective after a review of post-design or bid cost estimates;</p>
