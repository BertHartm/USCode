<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In order to be eligible for voluntary retirement under any provision of this title in a grade above major or lieutenant commander and below lieutenant general or vice admiral, a commissioned officer of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps must have served on active duty in that grade for not less than three years, except that the Secretary of Defense may authorize the Secretary of a military department to reduce such period to a period not less than two years in the case of retirements effective during the nine-year period beginning on October 1, 1990.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The President may waive subparagraph (A) in individual cases involving extreme hardship or exceptional or unusual circumstances. The authority of the President under the preceding sentence may not be delegated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Upon retirement an officer of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps who is serving in or has served in a position of importance and responsibility designated by the President to carry the grade of general or admiral or lieutenant general or vice admiral under section 601 of this title may, in the discretion of the President, be retired, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, in the highest grade held by him while serving on active duty.</p>
