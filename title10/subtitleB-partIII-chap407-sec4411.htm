<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Admission of Civilians as Students</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of the Army may enter into an agreement with an accredited institution of higher education (or a consortium of such institutions) under which students enrolled at an institution of higher education that is a party to the agreement may receive instruction at the Foreign Language Center of the Defense Language Institute on a space-available basis.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) The Secretary may also permit other persons who would benefit from the instruction provided at the Center, as determined by the Secretary, to receive instruction at the Center on a cost-reimbursable, space-available basis.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Selection and Attendance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall select the persons who will be permitted to receive instruction at the Center pursuant to subsection (a). In the case of agreements under subsection (a)(1), the Secretary shall consult with the other parties to the agreements to establish qualifications and methods of selection for persons to receive instruction at the Center.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) Except as the Secretary determines necessary, a person who receives instruction at the Center pursuant to subsection (a) shall be subject to the same regulations governing attendance, discipline, discharge, and dismissal as apply to other persons attending the Center.</p>
