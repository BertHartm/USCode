<p class="note-body">The first 13 words are substituted for 10:600<em>l</em>(f) (1st sentence, as applicable to retired grade) and 34:430 (1st sentence, as applicable to retired grade). The words &ldquo;for a period of more than 30 days&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;under *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* orders specifying that the period of such duty shall be for a period in excess of thirty days or for an indefinite period&rdquo;, to conform to the definition of those words in section 101(23) of this title. The words &ldquo;any full time duty&rdquo; are omitted, since the duty specified would necessarily be full time duty. The words &ldquo;under this section&rdquo; and &ldquo;competent&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.</p>
