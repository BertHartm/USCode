<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In order to be eligible for voluntary retirement under any provision of this title in a grade above major or lieutenant commander and below lieutenant general or vice admiral, a commissioned officer of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps must have served on active duty in that grade for not less than three years, except that the Secretary of Defense may authorize the Secretary of a military department to reduce such period to a period not less than two years in the case of retirements effective during the nine-year period beginning on October 1, 1990.</p>
