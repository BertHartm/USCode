<p class="statutory-body">(2) When furnishing routine port services under this section to naval vessels of a foreign country, the Secretary may furnish such services without reimbursement if such services are provided under an agreement that provides for the reciprocal furnishing by such country of routine port services to naval vessels of the United States without reimbursement.
