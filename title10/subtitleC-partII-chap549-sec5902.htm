<p class="note-body">Section 406 of the Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954 (50 U.S.C. 1306) makes applicable to reserve officers on a promotion list the laws relating to promotion and eligibility for promotion of regular officers on a promotion list, except that non-lineal-list officers in the line of the Naval Reserve and non-lineal-list officers of the Marine Corps Reserve, instead of being promoted to fill vacancies in the higher grade, are promoted when their lineal-list contemporaries are promoted. Staff corps officers, both in the Regular Navy and in the Naval Reserve, are promoted with their running mates. Provisions relating to the eligibility for promotion of regular and lineal-list staff corps officers are codified in sections 5773 and 5774 of this title.  </p>
<p class="note-body">Officers of the Marine Corps Reserve not on a lineal list have regular officers as running mates. It is possible for a number of lineal-list reserve officers to rank below a non-lineal-list Reserve and above his running mate. In such a case, the non-lineal-list Reserve's eligibility for consideration for promotion and for promotion is made to depend not on his running mate, but on the lineal-list Reserve next junior to him (sections 405 and 406 of the Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954 (50 U.S.C. 1305, 1306)). The result is the same as that produced in the Navy by assigning lineal-list officers as running mates of non-lineal-list Reserves, but differences in phraseology are required to describe the process.  </p>
<p class="note-body">Women officers of the Naval Reserve and the Marine Corps Reserve (except officers in the Nurse Corps and officers appointed under section 5581 of this title) have women regular officers as running mates. However, there are no women line officers of the Naval Reserve and no women officers of the Marine Corps Reserve on the lineal lists, since section 215 of the Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948 (34 U.S.C. 105j) made Title III of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 inapplicable to such women officers. The problem of tying a woman reserve officer's eligibility for promotion to someone other than her running mate does not, therefore, exist either in the Navy or in the Marine Corps.  </p>
