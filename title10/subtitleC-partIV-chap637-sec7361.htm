<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the words &ldquo;Secretary of Commerce&rdquo; and &ldquo;Department of Commerce&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;Maritime Commission&rdquo; and &ldquo;United States Maritime Commission&rdquo; to reflect 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 21, effective May 24, 1950, 15 F.R. 3178, 64 Stat. 1273. That Plan abolished the Maritime Commission and established the Maritime Administration in the Department of Commerce. It also created the Federal Maritime Board, the Chairman of which is ex officio the Maritime Administrator and head of the Maritime Administration. Certain specified functions of the Maritime Commission and its Chairman were transferred to the Federal Maritime Board or its Chairman. None of the functions so transferred relate to the subject matter of this section. All other functions were transferred to the Secretary of Commerce.  </p>
