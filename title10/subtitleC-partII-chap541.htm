<!-- PDFPage:1207 --><p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words &ldquo;except an officer in the Nurse Corps or an officer appointed under section 5581 of this title&rdquo; are inserted because these officers, although of the female sex, are not &ldquo;women officers&rdquo; within the meaning of the Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954. Several sections of the source statute contain separate provisions for women officers and for officers of the Nurse Corps Reserve, and section 405(a) recognizes the fact that the latter, like Regular Navy nurses, have lineal list line officers (all of whom are male) as running mates. The legislative history of the source statute and its amendments shows clearly that &ldquo;women officers&rdquo; and &ldquo;officers of the Nurse Corps Reserve&rdquo; were considered as two distinct categories. &ldquo;Officers appointed under section 5581 of this title&rdquo; constitute an additional category. There is no indication in the legislative history of the source statute that Congress had any intention to supersede, as to Reserves, the act of June 24, 1952, ch. 457 (66 Stat. 155; 34 U.S.C. 21e) (codified in section 5581 of this title). That act made applicable to women all laws authorizing the appointment of men as officers in the Medical, Dental, and Medical Service Corps, and provided that all laws relating to male officers in these corps should also apply to women. Accordingly, women appointed in the Regular Navy pursuant to that act have male line officers as running mates and are considered for promotion with their male contemporaries. To provide the same treatment for women appointed in the Naval Reserve in these corps, it is necessary to exclude them from the provisions of the Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954 relating to &ldquo;women officers&rdquo;. Throughout the latter act, it is apparent that Congress intended reserve officers in each category to be administered in a manner as similar as possible to the administration of regular officers in the same category.  </p>
