<p class="note-body">After the enactment of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, section 308 of the Army Organization Act of 1950 (10:61&ndash;1) provided for an Assistant Judge Advocate General and three brigadier generals in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the Army. The creation of these four general officer spaces served to increase the mentioned authorized strength figure from 357 to 361, and the figure 201 to 205. The opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1948/5806, 2 Sept. 1948) is in accord with that conclusion.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section reflects the authorized strength of the Regular Air Force in general officers on the active list resulting from the mentioned allocation to the Air Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">That allocation, and those mentioned in the explanation of subsection (c) below, have had the force of law since July 26, 1950, when the period for transfers, including the administrative authority to change these allocations, expired.</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;regular&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; throughout the revised subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), 10:506a(a) (1st proviso) is omitted, since there is no authority to appoint to a regular grade above major general. 10:506a(a) (last 65 words of 2d proviso) is omitted as executed by the declaration of a national emergency on December 16, 1950.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1), the figures &ldquo;4&rdquo; and &ldquo;2&rdquo; result from the allocation of the original figures &ldquo;16&rdquo; and &ldquo;8&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(2), the figure &ldquo;1&rdquo; results from the allocation of the original figures &ldquo;4&rdquo; and &ldquo;2&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(3), the figure &ldquo;1&rdquo; results from the allocation of the original figures &ldquo;2&rdquo; and &ldquo;1&rdquo;. (The major general was allocated to the Army, the brigadier general to the Air Force.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(4), the figures &ldquo;150&rdquo; and &ldquo;75&rdquo; result from the allocation of the original figures &ldquo;334&rdquo; and &ldquo;167&rdquo;. That allocation corresponds to the allotment made by the Secretary of War between the Air Corps and the Army exclusive of the Air Corps, the Medical Department, and the Chaplains, under 10: 506a(a) (3d proviso).

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to authorize the Secretary of the Air Force to limit the amount of prior commissioned service with which a person may be credited under paragraph (1), or to deny any such credit, in the case of a person who is credited with constructive service under subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Air Force shall credit a person who is receiving an original appointment as a reserve commissioned officer in the Air Force or a designation in or assignment to an officer category in which advanced education or training or special experience is required or will be directly used and who has advanced education or training or special experience with constructive service for such education, training, or experience as follows:</p>

<!-- PDFPage:1378 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) Credit for any period of advanced education in a health profession (other than medicine and dentistry) beyond the baccalaureate degree level which exceeds the basic education criteria for designation or assignment as an officer in such health profession, if such advanced education will be directly used by the Air Force.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Credit for experience in a health profession (other than medicine or dentistry), if such experience will be directly used by the Air Force.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Additional credit of (i) not more than one year for internship or equivalent graduate medical, dental, or other formal professional training required by the armed forces, and (ii) not more than one year for each additional year of such graduate-level training or experience creditable toward certification in a speciality required by the Air Force.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Each board shall be composed of at least five members who are senior in regular or reserve grade to, and who outrank, any officer considered by that board. Five members of a board constitute a quorum. So far as practicable, at least one-half of the members of the board must be reserve officers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A board serves for as long as the Secretary of the Air Force prescribes but not longer than one year. A member may not serve on two consecutive boards for promotions to the same grade, if the second board considers any officers considered but not recommended for promotion by the first.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Each member of a board must swear that he will perform his duties without prejudice or partiality, having in view the special fitness of officers and the efficiency of the Air Force.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A recommendation for promotion must be made by the majority of the total membership of the board. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a board that is to recommend officers for promotion whom it considers to be the best qualified may recommend only those officers whom it also considers to be fully qualified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) An officer eligible for consideration for promotion by a board under this chapter is entitled to send a letter, through official channels, calling attention to any matter of record in the armed forces concerning himself that he considers important to his case. The letter may not criticize any officer or reflect on his character, conduct, or motives. A letter sent under this subsection may not be considered by a selection board unless it is received by the time the board convenes.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an officer who is deferred because he was found not qualified for Federal recognition shall be considered for promotion by the next appropriate selection board convened under section 8366 of this title when the officer next junior to him is also considered, but not before one year after the date on which he was found not qualified for Federal recognition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) An officer who is deferred because he was considered but not recommended by a selection board may, if he is appointed to the next higher grade in the Air National Guard, be examined for Federal recognition in that grade at any time before the date on which he must be considered for promotion under subsection (c)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) An officer who is deferred because he was found not qualified for Federal recognition in the next higher grade may be again examined for Federal recognition in that grade at any time before the date on which he must be considered for promotion under subsection (c)(2), but not before one year after the date on which he was first found not qualified for Federal recognition in that grade.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) A deferred officer who is again considered for promotion under subsection (c)(1) and is not recommended for promotion, or is recommended and declines the promotion, may not thereafter be considered for promotion or examined for Federal recognition, and shall be treated as provided in section 8846(a) of this title and section 323(e) of title 32.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) A reserve officer who is serving on active duty (other than for training) in a temporary grade which is higher than his reserve grade shall, upon his application, be promoted to the next higher reserve grade when he completes the amount of service in his current reserve grade prescribed by section 8363(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If an officer of the Air National Guard of the United States is eligible and applies for promotion under this section, the governor or other appropriate authority of the jurisdiction concerned may promote him to fill a vacancy specially created, if necessary, in the Air National Guard of the jurisdiction concerned. If he is so promoted, he shall, effective on the date of promotion, be extended Federal recognition in the grade to which promoted, without the examination prescribed in section 307 of title 32. If he is not so promoted in the Air National Guard within 90 days after he applies, his Federal recognition in his reserve grade shall be terminated and he shall be transferred to the Air Force Reserve and promoted therein.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A reserve officer who is serving on active duty (other than for training) in a temporary grade that is higher than his reserve grade retains that temporary grade if he is released from active duty before completing the amount of service prescribed in section 8363(a) of this title or before applying for promotion under subsection (a). When he completes that amount of service and applies, or if, having completed that amount of service before being released from active duty, he applies, an officer covered by this subsection shall be promoted to the next higher reserve grade, without regard to vacancies. An officer of the Air National Guard covered by this subsection who is promoted to a grade in the Air National Guard which is equal to his temporary grade, shall be extended Federal recognition in that grade, without the examination prescribed in section 307 of title 32. If necessary, he shall be carried as an additional number therein until a vacancy occurs, but not for more than two years. If a vacancy does not occur within two years, his Federal recognition shall be terminated and he shall be transferred to the Air Force Reserve. This subsection does not apply to promotion to the reserve grade of brigadier general or major general.</p>

<p class="note-body">In the introductory paragraph, the applicability of the rule stated in the third sentence to situations not expressly covered by the laws named in the source statutes above is a practical construction that the rule must be reciprocally applied in all cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">In formula B, the words &ldquo;basic pay&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;base and longevity pay&rdquo; to conform to the terminology of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 802 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.). The words &ldquo;his retired grade&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;permanent grade held at time of retirement&rdquo; to reflect the right to higher retired grade when qualified under other provisions of law. 10:941a(e) (last proviso of clause (1)), is omitted, since, under section 202 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 807 (37 U.S.C. 233), the active duty pay of all members of the Air Force is based upon years of service.</p>
<p class="note-body">In formula C, the computation is based on monthly pay instead of annual pay to conform to the other formulas of the revised section. The words &ldquo;basic pay&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;active duty base and longevity pay&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;in determining his basic pay&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;for longevity pay purposes&rdquo;, to conform to the terminology of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 802 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.). The words &ldquo;Monthly basic pay of member's retired grade&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;the rank upon which they are retired&rdquo;, in 10:971, and &ldquo;rank with which retired&rdquo;, in 10:971b, to reflect their right to advancement on the retired list. 10:971 now applies only when the retiring officer has 30 or more years of service which may be credited in computing his retired pay. 10:971b (2d proviso) is omitted, since, under section 202 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 807 (37 U.S.C. 233), the pay of all members is based upon cumulative years of service. 10:971b (4th proviso) is omitted as executed. 10:971b (last proviso) is omitted, since the distinction between limited and unlimited retired lists was abolished by section 201 of the Act of June 29, 1948, ch. 708, 62 Stat. 1084. Sections 8918, 8920, and 8924 are included under this formula, since it achieves the same result as is reached on a basis of 30 years multiplied by 21/2 percent, and simplifies the table.</p>
<p class="note-body">In formulas D and E the words &ldquo;credited under section 8925&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;active Federal service&rdquo;, since that revised section makes explicit the service covered. The Act of August 10, 1946, ch. 952, &sect;6(c), 60 Stat. 996, is not contained in 10:948. It is also omitted from the revised section as executed. 10:980 now applies only when the retiring enlisted member has at least 30 years of service which may be credited in computing his retired pay. However, as noted above, <!-- PDFPage:1426 -->10:980 is the only provision of law applicable to cases in which the retiring member has at least 30 years of service. The Act of June 16, 1942, ch. 413, &sect;19 (63d through 75th words of 2d par.), 56 Stat. 369, repealed so much of the Act of March 2, 1907, ch. 2513, 34 Stat. 1217, as provided allowances for enlisted men on the retired list. The repeal of section 19 of the Act of June 16, 1942, by section 531(b)(34) of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 839, did not revive that portion of the Act of March 2, 1907, which had been repealed by the Act of June 16, 1942. Accordingly, the Act of March 2, 1907, as thus modified by the Act of June 16, 1942, is used as the basis for formula E.</p>
<p class="note-body">Footnote 2 reflects the long-standing construction of those provisions dealing with computation of retired pay which do not specifically provide that the member is entitled to compute his retired pay on the basis of the monthly basic pay to which he would be entitled if he were on active duty in his retired grade. Except in cases covered by formula C, the pertinent basic computation provisions for such retirement either provide for computation of retired pay on the same basis as the provisions dealing with higher retired grade, or the basic retirement provisions were themselves enacted after the provisions authorizing higher retired grade. The provisos of 10:1002 and 1005 are omitted as surplusage, since no formula for the computation of retired pay includes inactive service on the retired list as a credit.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;at rates applicable on date of retirement and adjust to reflect later changes in permanent rates&rdquo;, in footnote 2; and all of footnote 4; are based on the source statutes incorporated in the formulas to which footnotes 2 and 4 apply.</p>
<p class="note-body">In footnote 4, the words &ldquo;and disregard a part of a year that is less than six months&rdquo; are made applicable to formulas A&ndash;E, although this part of the rule is expressed only as to formula B, in 10:941a(4)(1). The legislative history of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (Hearings before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on H.R. 5007, 81st Congress, first session, p. 313, July 6, 1949) indicates that the provisions, upon which formulas A and C&ndash;E are based, should be construed to require that a part of a year that is less than six months be disregarded.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the word &ldquo;members&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;officers and enlisted men&rdquo;, in 10:1237. Clause (2) is substituted for 10:904. Reference to the Secretary of the Air Force is substituted for reference to branch, office, or officers of the Army, in 10:1237, since the functions which, for the Army are assigned to subordinate officers, are, for the Air Force assigned to the Secretary of the Air Force. 32:156 is omitted as covered by 10:904, since the words &ldquo;officers of the Air Force&rdquo; necessarily cover all persons named in 32:156. The words &ldquo;Except for articles and items acquired through the use of working capital funds under sections 172&ndash;172j of title 5&rdquo; are inserted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (63 Stat. 585), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses. (See opinion of the Assistant General Counsel (Fiscal Matters) of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, January 4, 1955.)  </p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the first sentence states expressly the rule which is implicit in 10:1238. The word &ldquo;members&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;officers and enlisted men&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;shall be understood, in all cases of such sales&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The last sentence is inserted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (63 Stat. 585), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses. (See opinion of the Deputy General Counsel of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, March 28, 1956.)  </p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the word &ldquo;members&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;officers and enlisted men&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;prices at which like property is sold to&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;same price as is charged the&rdquo;.  </p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (c) and (d), the words &ldquo;other armed forces&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;Navy and Marine Corps&rdquo;, since such sales are authorized to members of the Coast Guard by section 144(b) of Title 14.  </p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words &ldquo;other than subsistence supplies&rdquo; are inserted, since the sale of subsistence supplies is covered by subsection (c).  </p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words &ldquo;a person who has been discharged&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;discharged officers and enlisted men&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;Navy *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* or Marine Corps&rdquo;, omitted from the 1952 edition of the United States Code, are inserted to conform to the source statute. The words &ldquo;may buy&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;shall *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* be permitted to purchase&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;at the prices at which like property is sold&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;at the same price as charged&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;member&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;officers and enlisted men&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;while undergoing such care and treatment&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.  </p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f), the words &ldquo;person who has been discharged&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;former members *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* who have been separated therefrom&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;at the prices at which like articles are sold to members&rdquo; are inserted to conform to the last sentence of subsection (a) and subsection (e).  </p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (g), the words &ldquo;regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;Army Regulations&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;of the Government&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. 10:1253 (last 22 words of 1st sentence) is omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;or to another executive department of the Government&rdquo; are omitted as superseded by section 7 of the act of May 21, 1920, ch. 194, as amended (31 U.S.C. 686). The provisions of 10:1253 relating to the computation of cost are omitted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (63 Stat. 585), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses. (See opinion of the Assistant General Counsel (Fiscal Matters) of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, January 4, 1955.)  </p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (h), the word &ldquo;outside&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;beyond the continental limitations&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;or in Alaska&rdquo; are omitted, since, under section 101(1) of this title, the words &ldquo;United States&rdquo; are defined to include only the States and the District of Columbia. The word &ldquo;continental&rdquo;, after the words &ldquo;within the&rdquo;, is omitted for the same reason. The last sentence is substituted for 10:1241 (proviso).  </p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (i), 10:1196 (last 30 words) is omitted as superseded by the Act of April 27, 1914, ch. 72 (last proviso under &ldquo;Subsistence of the Army&rdquo;), 38 Stat. 361. The words &ldquo;So much of the&rdquo; and &ldquo;as may be necessary&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;members *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* on active duty, for the use of themselves and their families&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;officers for the use of themselves and their families, and to commanders of companies or other organizations, for the use of the enlisted men of their companies or organizations&rdquo;, to conform to 10:1237 and 1238. Those sections provide the basic authority for procurement and sale of subsistence supplies to all members. This interpretation conforms to established administrative practice under those sections. The word &ldquo;supplies&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;stores&rdquo;.  </p>

<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;subject to such regulations as he may prescribe&rdquo; are omitted, since the Secretary has inherent authority to issue regulations appropriate to exercising his statutory functions. The words &ldquo;to any of the &lsquo;National Homes for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers&rsquo; already established or hereafter established and&rdquo;, in the Act of February 8, 1889, ch. 116, 25 Stat. 657, are not contained in 50:66 (2d sentence). They are also omitted from the revised section, since the National Homes for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers were dissolved by the Act of July 3, 1930, ch. 863, 46 Stat. 1016.

Although section 402(e) of the Army Organization Act of 1950, ch. 383, 64 Stat. 273, amended the Act of May 26, 1900, it did not have the effect of reviving that act.

The words &ldquo;serviceable&rdquo; and &ldquo;as may be on hand undisposed of&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.

<p class="note-body">Before the enactment of the National Security Act of 1947, the transport functions covered by this section were performed only by the Army. Under Transfer Order 26, 15 Oct. 1948, JAAF Bull. 42, 1948; JAAFAR 4&ndash;55&ndash;1, par. 2a(1)(f), 29 Oct. 1948; AR 96&ndash;15, AFR 76&ndash;7, 5 June 1951; AR 96&ndash;20, AFR 76&ndash;6, 11 June 1953, these transport functions also became the responsibility of the Secretary of the Air Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under section 2(a)(3) of the National Security Act (as it existed before August 10, 1949), the sea transportation functions of the Army and Navy, and the air transportation functions of the Army, Navy, and Air Force were respectively consolidated into the &ldquo;Military Sea Transportation Service&rdquo;, under the Department of the Navy, and the &ldquo;Military Air Transport Service&rdquo;, under the Department of the Air Force. Instead of having space on transport vessels and airplanes operated by it for its sole use, the Air Force is allotted bulk space on vessels and airplanes operated by military transport agencies operating for the benefit of the Department of Defense as a whole. The words &ldquo;or, within bulk space allocations made to the Department of the Air Force, on vessels or airplanes operated by any military transport agency of the Department of Defense&rdquo; are inserted, in accordance with an opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1953/5885, 22 July 1953), concurred in by the Judge Advocate General of the Air Force, to make clear that the rule applicable to vessels and airplanes applies to the bulk space allocated to the Air Force. Since the authority to perform transportation functions could again be transferred as between the military departments, the references to airplanes of Air Force transport agencies (as distinct from bulk space allocations thereon) is retained.</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;considers&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;in the opinion of&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;Persons residing in Alaska who are and have been employed there by the United States&rdquo;, are substituted for the words &ldquo;employees of the United States, residing in Alaska, who have been in such employment&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;civil&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;from and after November 21, 1941&rdquo;, &ldquo;and the carriage of all such air traffic shall be terminated&rdquo;, &ldquo;dire&rdquo;, &ldquo;the privilege herein granted&rdquo;, and &ldquo;as to each eligible individual&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.
