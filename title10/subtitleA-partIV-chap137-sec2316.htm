<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;company, or corporation&rdquo; are omitted as included in &ldquo;person&rdquo; because of section 1:1. The words &ldquo;On and after the date of enactment of this Act&rdquo; are omitted as executed. The word &ldquo;contractor&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;person, company, or corporation to whom such contract has been awarded&rdquo; and &ldquo;person, company, or corporation to whom any defense contract has been awarded&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;and the identity of the contractor&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;and to whom it was awarded&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
