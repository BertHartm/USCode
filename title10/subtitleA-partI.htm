<p class="note-body">The definitions in clauses (3), (15), (18)&ndash;(21), (23)&ndash;(30), and (31)&ndash;(33) reflect the adoption of terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes restated in this title, represents the closest practicable approximation of the ways in which the terms defined have been most commonly used. A choice has been made where established uses conflict.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (2), the definition of &ldquo;Territory&rdquo; in 32:4c is executed throughout this revised title by specific reference, where applicable, to the Territories, Puerto Rico and the Canal Zone.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (4), the definition of &ldquo;armed forces&rdquo; is based on the source statute instead of 50:551(2), which does not include an express reference to the Marine Corps. The words &ldquo;including all components thereof&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (5), the term &ldquo;Department&rdquo; is defined to give it the broad sense of &ldquo;Establishment&rdquo;, to conform to the source statute and the usage preferred by the Department of Defense, instead of the more limited sense defined by 5:421g(a) and 423a(a), and 10:1a(d) and 1801(d).</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (6), the term &ldquo;executive part of the department&rdquo; is created for convenience in referring to what is described in the source statutes for this title as &ldquo;department&rdquo; in the limited sense of the executive part at the seat of government. This is required by the adoption of the word &ldquo;department&rdquo; in clause (5) to cover the broader concept of &ldquo;establishment&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (8), the term &ldquo;Secretary concerned&rdquo; is created and defined for legislative convenience.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (9), a definition of &ldquo;National Guard&rdquo; is inserted for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (10)(A), the words &ldquo;a land force&rdquo; are substituted for 32:2 (as applicable to Army National Guard). The National Defense Act of 1916, &sect;117 (last 66 words), 39 Stat. 212, is not contained in 32:2. It is also omitted from the revised section as repealed by the Act of February 28, 1925, ch. 374, &sect;3, 43 Stat. 1081.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (10) and (11), the word &ldquo;Army&rdquo; is inserted to distinguish the organizations defined from their Air Force counterparts.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (10) and (12), the words &ldquo;unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires&rdquo; and &ldquo;as provided in this title&rdquo;, in 32:4b, are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (10)(B) and (12)(B), the words &ldquo;has its officers appointed&rdquo; are substituted for the word &ldquo;officered&rdquo;, in 32:4b.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (11) and (13), only that much of the description of the composition of the Army National Guard of the United States and the Air National Guard of the United States is used as is necessary to distinguish these reserve components, respectively, from the other reserve components.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (12)(A), the words &ldquo;an air force&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;for which Federal responsibility has been vested in the Secretary of the Air Force or the Department of the Air Force pursuant to law&rdquo;, in 10:1835, and for 32:2 (as applicable to Air National Guard), to make the definition of &ldquo;Air National Guard&rdquo; parallel with the definition of &ldquo;Army National Guard&rdquo;, and to make explicit the intent of Congress, in creating the Air National Guard, that the organized militia henceforth should consist of three mutually exhaustive classes comprising the Army, Air, and Naval militia.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (14), the definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; is based on the source statutes instead of 50:551(5), which excludes warrant officers. The reference to appointment in 10:1a(b) (2d sentence and 10:1801(b) (2d sentence), and the words &ldquo;commissioned warrant officer&rdquo;, &ldquo;flight officer&rdquo;, and &ldquo;either permanent or temporary&rdquo;, in 37:231(c) (1st sentence), are omitted as surplusage. 5:181&ndash;3(b) (1st sentence), 10:1a(b) (1st sentence), and 10:1801(b) (1st sentence) are omitted as covered by the definitions in clauses (14) and (16) of the revised section and by section 3062(c) and section 8062(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (16), the words &ldquo;unless otherwise qualified&rdquo;, &ldquo;permanent or temporary&rdquo;, and &ldquo;in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard, including any component thereof&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body"> In clause (22), the definition of &ldquo;active duty&rdquo; is based on the definition of &ldquo;active Federal service&rdquo; in the source statute, since it is believed to be closer to general usage than the definition in 50:901(b), which excludes active duty for training from the general concept of active duty.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1988 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (k) is based on Pub. L. 100&ndash;202, &sect;101(b) [title VIII, &sect;8042], 101 Stat. 1329&ndash;69.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 8042 of the FY88 Defense Appropriations Act (Public Law 100&ndash;202) established a requirement for the Secretary of Defense to submit an annual report on the cost of stationing United States forces overseas. Under that section, the annual report is to be sent to the Committees on Appropriations of the two Houses. In codifying that section as section 113(k) of title 10, the committee added the two Armed Services Committees as committees to be sent the annual report. This minor change from the source law does not change the nature of the report to be submitted.</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee notes that the source section does not specify the period of time to be covered by the report. In the absence of statutory language specifying the period to be covered by the report, it would seem reasonable to conclude that the report should cover the previous fiscal year. The committee notes, however, that the report of the Senate Appropriations Committee on its FY88 defense appropriations bill (S. Rpt. 100&ndash;235) <!-- PDFPage:35 -->states that this new annual report &ldquo;should cover the budget years and the 2 previous fiscal years&rdquo; (page 54). The committee believes that such a requirement may be unnecessarily burdensome and in any case, if such a requirement is intended, should be stated in the statute. In the absence of clear intent, the provision is proposed to be codified without specifying the period of time to be covered by the annual report.</p>
<p class="note-body">In codifying this provision, the committee also changed the term &ldquo;United States troops&rdquo; in the source law to &ldquo;United States forces&rdquo; for consistency in usage in title 10 and as being preferable usage. No change in meaning is intended. The committee also changed &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; to &ldquo;outside the United States&rdquo; and defined &ldquo;United States&rdquo; for this purpose to include the territories and possessions of the United States. The committee was concerned that the term &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; read literally could include Hawaii or Guam, an interpretation clearly not intended in enacting section 8042. The committee notes that the Senate report referred to above states &ldquo;For the purposes of this report [meaning the new DOD annual report], U.S. forces stationed overseas are considered to be those outside of the United States and its territories.&rdquo;. The committee extrapolates from this statement that provisions in the report requirement relating to expenditures &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; and costs incurred &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; are also to be construed as relating to matters outside the United States and its territories and has prepared the codified provision accordingly.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Annual Report on Moratorium on Use by Armed Forces of Antipersonnel Landmines</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 1309 of Pub. L. 105&ndash;85 provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The United States has stated its support for a ban on antipersonnel landmines that is global in scope and verifiable.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) On May 16, 1996, the President announced that the United States, as a matter of policy, would eliminate its stockpile of non-self-destructing antipersonnel landmines, except those used for training purposes and in Korea, and that the United States would reserve the right to use self-destructing antipersonnel landmines in the event of conflict.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) On May 16, 1996, the President also announced that the United States would lead an effort to negotiate an international treaty permanently banning the use of all antipersonnel landmines.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The United States is currently participating at the United Nations Conference on Disarmament in negotiations aimed at achieving a global ban on the use of antipersonnel landmines.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) On August 18, 1997, the administration agreed to participate in international negotiations sponsored by Canada (the so-called &lsquo;Ottawa process&rsquo;) designed to achieve a treaty that would outlaw the production, use, and sale of antipersonnel landmines.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) On September 17, 1997, the President announced that the United States would not sign the antipersonnel landmine treaty concluded in Oslo, Norway, by participants in the Ottawa process because the treaty would not provide a geographic exception to allow the United States to stockpile and use antipersonnel landmines in Korea or an exemption that would preserve the ability of the United States to use mixed antitank mine systems which could be used to deter an armored assault against United States forces.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The President also announced a change in United States policy whereby the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) would no longer deploy antipersonnel landmines, including self-destructing antipersonnel landmines, by 2003, except in Korea;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) would seek to field alternatives by that date, or by 2006 in the case of Korea;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) would undertake a new initiative in the United Nations Conference on Disarmament to establish a global ban on the transfer of antipersonnel landmines; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) would increase its current humanitarian demining activities around the world.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The President's decision would allow the continued use by United States forces of self-destructing antipersonnel landmines that are used as part of a mixed antitank mine system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Under existing law (as provided in section 580 of Public Law 104&ndash;107; 110 Stat. 751), on February 12, 1999, the United States will implement a one-year moratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines by United States forces except along internationally recognized national borders or in demilitarized zones within a perimeter marked area that is monitored by military personnel and protected by adequate means to ensure the exclusion of civilians.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Sense of Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the United States should not implement a moratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines by United States Armed Forces in a manner that would endanger United States personnel or undermine the military effectiveness of United States Armed Forces in executing their missions; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the United States should pursue the development of alternatives to self-destructing antipersonnel landmines.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Annual Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than December 31 each year, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense committees [Committees on Armed Services and Appropriations of Senate and House of Representatives] a report concerning antipersonnel landmines. Each such report shall include the Secretary's description of the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The military utility of the continued deployment and use by the United States of antipersonnel landmines.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The effect of a moratorium on the production, stockpiling, and use of antipersonnel landmines on the ability of United States forces to deter and defend against attack on land by hostile forces, including on the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Progress in developing and fielding systems that are effective substitutes for antipersonnel landmines, including an identification and description of the types of systems that are being developed and fielded, the costs associated with those systems, and the estimated timetable for developing and fielding those systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The effect of a moratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines on the military effectiveness of current antitank mine systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The number and type of pure antipersonnel landmines that remain in the United States inventory and that are subject to elimination under the President's September 17, 1997, declaration on United States antipersonnel landmine policy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The number and type of mixed antitank mine systems that are in the United States inventory, the locations where they are deployed, and their effect on the deterrence and warfighting ability of United States Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The effect of the elimination of pure antipersonnel landmines on the warfighting effectiveness of the United States Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The costs already incurred and anticipated of eliminating antipersonnel landmines from the United States inventory in accordance with the policy enunciated by the President on September 17, 1997.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The benefits that would result to United States military and civilian personnel from an international treaty banning the production, use, transfer, and stockpiling of antipersonnel landmines.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(5), the words &ldquo;It is the sense of Congress that&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;Secretary of Defense&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Department of Defense&rdquo; the first time it appears because the responsibility is in the head of the agency. The word &ldquo;Therefore&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. The word &ldquo;complete&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;full&rdquo;, and the word &ldquo;personnel&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;manpower&rdquo; except in the phrase &ldquo;manpower requirements&rdquo;, for consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (i), the words &ldquo;may be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. only if&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;No .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. may be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unless&rdquo; to use the positive voice. The words &ldquo;after June 30, 1966&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;after that date&rdquo; for clarity.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;123. Authority to suspend officer personnel laws during war or national emergency</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In time of war, or of national emergency declared by Congress or the President after November 30, 1980, the President may suspend the operation of any provision of law relating to the promotion, involuntary retirement, or separation of commissioned officers of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard Reserve. So long as such war or national emergency continues, any such suspension may be extended by the President.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Any such suspension shall, if not sooner ended, end on the last day of the two-year period beginning on the date on which the suspension (or the last extension thereof) takes effect or on the last day of the one-year period beginning on the date of the termination of the war or national emergency, whichever occurs first. With respect to the end of any such suspension, the preceding sentence supersedes the provisions of title II of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1621&ndash;1622) which provide that powers or authorities exercised by reason of a national <!-- PDFPage:98 -->emergency shall cease to be exercised after the date of the termination of the emergency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If a provision of law pertaining to the promotion of reserve officers is suspended under this section and if the Secretary of Defense submits to Congress proposed legislation to adjust the grades and dates of rank of reserve commissioned officers other than commissioned warrant officers, such proposed legislation shall, so far as practicable, be the same as that recommended for adjusting the grades and dates of rank of officers of the regular component of the armed force concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Upon the termination of a suspension made under the authority of subsection (a) of a provision of law otherwise requiring the separation or retirement of officers on active duty because of age, length of service or length of service in grade, or failure of selection for promotion, the Secretary concerned shall extend by up to 90 days the otherwise required separation or retirement date of any officer covered by the suspended provision whose separation or retirement date, but for the suspension, would have been before the date of the termination of the suspension or within 90 days after the date of such termination.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Humanitarian and civic assistance activities carried out under this section shall complement, and may not duplicate, any other form of social or economic assistance which may be provided to the country concerned by any other department or agency of the United States.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Humanitarian and civic assistance may not be provided under this section (directly or indirectly) to any individual, group, or organization engaged in military or paramilitary activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that no member of the armed forces, while providing assistance under this section that is described in subsection (e)(5)&mdash;</p>

Any such provision may be construed as superseding a provision of this section only if, and to the extent that, such provision specifically refers to this section and specifically identifies the provision of this section that is to be <!-- PDFPage:191 -->considered superseded or otherwise inapplicable under such provision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Expenses incurred as a direct result of providing humanitarian and civic assistance under this section to a foreign country shall be paid for out of funds specifically appropriated for such purpose.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this section may be interpreted to preclude the incurring of minimal expenditures by the Department of Defense for purposes of humanitarian and civic assistance out of funds other than funds appropriated pursuant to paragraph (1), except that funds appropriated to the Department of Defense for operation and maintenance (other than funds appropriated pursuant to such paragraph) may be obligated for humanitarian and civic assistance under this section only for incidental costs of carrying out such assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives a report, not later than March 1 of each year, on activities carried out under this section during the preceding fiscal year. The Secretary shall include in each such report&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a list of the countries in which humanitarian and civic assistance activities were carried out during the preceding fiscal year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the type and description of such activities carried out in each country during the preceding fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the amount expended in carrying out each such activity in each such country during the preceding fiscal year.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) As part of transformation efforts within the Department of Defense, each of the Armed Forces is developing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities that best support future war fighting as envisioned by the leadership of the military department concerned.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Concurrently, intelligence agencies of the Department of Defense outside the military departments are developing transformation roadmaps to <!-- PDFPage:199 -->best support the future decisionmaking and war fighting needs of their principal customers, but are not always closely coordinating those efforts with the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance development efforts of the military departments.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) A senior official of each military department has been designated as the integrator of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance for each of the Armed Forces in such military department, but there is not currently a well-defined forum through which the integrators of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities for each of the Armed Forces can routinely interact with each other and with senior representatives of Department of Defense intelligence agencies, as well as with other members of the intelligence community, to ensure unity of effort and to preclude unnecessary duplication of effort.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The current funding structure of a National Foreign Intelligence Program (NFIP), Joint Military Intelligence Program (JMIP), and Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities Program (TIARA) may not be the best approach for supporting the development of an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance structure that is integrated to meet the national security requirements of the United States in the 21st century.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The position of Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence was established in 2002 by Public Law 107&ndash;314 [see 10 U.S.C. 137] in order to facilitate resolution of the challenges to achieving an integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance structure in the Department of Defense to meet such 21st century requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Goal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It shall be a goal of the Department of Defense to fully integrate the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities and coordinate the developmental activities of the military departments, intelligence agencies of the Department of Defense, and relevant combatant commands as those departments, agencies, and commands transform their intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems to meet current and future needs.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 921. FINDINGS CONCERNING JOINT WARFIGHTING EXPERIMENTATION.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The assessments of the Quadrennial Defense Review and the National Defense Panel provide a compelling argument&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) that the security environment in the early 21st century will include fundamentally different military challenges than the security environment in the late 20th century; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) reinforce the premise of the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 [Pub. L. 99&ndash;433, see Tables for classification] that future warfare will require more effective joint operational concepts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Joint experimentation is necessary for&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) integrating advances in technology with changes in organizational structure and joint operational concepts; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) determining the interdependent aspects of joint warfare that are key for transforming the conduct of military operations to meet future challenges successfully.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) It is essential that an energetic and innovative organization be established in the Department of Defense with the authority (subject to the authority and guidance of the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) to design and implement a process of joint experimentation to inves<!-- PDFPage:215 -->tigate and test technologies and alternative forces and concepts in field environments under realistic conditions against the full range of future challenges to assist in developing and validating new joint warfighting concepts and transforming the Armed Forces to meet the threats to national security anticipated for the early 21st century.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 922. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING JOINT WARFIGHTING EXPERIMENTATION.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Designation of Commander To Have Joint Warfighting Experimentation Mission</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that the initiative of the Secretary of Defense to designate the commander of a combatant command to have the mission of joint warfighting experimentation is a key step in exploiting the potential of advanced technologies, new organizational structures, and new joint operational concepts to transform the conduct of military operations by the Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Resources and Authority of Commander</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is, further, the sense of Congress that the commander of the combatant command referred to in subsection (a) should be provided with appropriate and sufficient resources for joint warfighting experimentation and with the appropriate authority to execute the commander's assigned responsibilities and that such authority should include the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Planning, preparing, and conducting the program of joint warfighting experimentation, which program should include analyses, simulations, wargames, experiments, advanced concept technology demonstrations, joint exercises conducted in virtual and field environments, and, as a particularly critical aspect, assessments of &lsquo;red team&rsquo; vulnerability.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Developing scenarios and measures of effectiveness to meet the operational challenges expected to be encountered in the early 21st century and assessing the effectiveness of current and new organizational structures, operational concepts, and technologies in addressing those challenges.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Integrating and testing in joint experimentation the systems and concepts that result from warfighting experimentation conducted by the Armed Forces and the Defense Agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Coordinating with each of the Armed Forces and Defense Agencies regarding the development and acquisition of equipment (including surrogate or real technologies, platforms, and systems), supplies, and services necessary for joint experimentation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Providing the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with recommendations, based on the conduct of joint warfighting experimentation, for&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) improving interoperability;</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) prioritizing the most promising joint capabilities for future experimentation; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) prioritizing joint requirements and acquisition programs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Making recommendations to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on mission needs statements and operational requirements documents.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Congressional Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is, further, the sense of Congress that Congress&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) should review the adequacy of the process of transformation to meet future challenges to the national security; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) if progress is determined inadequate, should consider legislation to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) establish an appropriate organization to conduct the mission described in subsection (a); and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) provide to the commander given the responsibility for that mission appropriate and sufficient resources for joint warfighting experimentation and the appropriate authority to execute that commander's assigned responsibilities for that mission, including the authorities specified in subsection (b).</p>
