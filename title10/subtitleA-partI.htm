</table>
<p class="note-body">The definitions in clauses (3), (15), (18)&ndash;(21), (23)&ndash;(30), and (31)&ndash;(33) reflect the adoption of terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes restated in this title, represents the closest practicable approximation of the ways in which the terms defined have been most commonly used. A choice has been made where established uses conflict.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (2), the definition of &ldquo;Territory&rdquo; in 32:4c is executed throughout this revised title by specific reference, where applicable, to the Territories, Puerto Rico and the Canal Zone.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (4), the definition of &ldquo;armed forces&rdquo; is based on the source statute instead of 50:551(2), which does not include an express reference to the Marine Corps. The words &ldquo;including all components thereof&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (5), the term &ldquo;Department&rdquo; is defined to give it the broad sense of &ldquo;Establishment&rdquo;, to conform to the source statute and the usage preferred by the Department of Defense, instead of the more limited sense defined by 5:421g(a) and 423a(a), and 10:1a(d) and 1801(d).</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (6), the term &ldquo;executive part of the department&rdquo; is created for convenience in referring to what is described in the source statutes for this title as &ldquo;department&rdquo; in the limited sense of the executive part at the seat of government. This is required by the adoption of the word &ldquo;department&rdquo; in clause (5) to cover the broader concept of &ldquo;establishment&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (8), the term &ldquo;Secretary concerned&rdquo; is created and defined for legislative convenience.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (9), a definition of &ldquo;National Guard&rdquo; is inserted for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (10)(A), the words &ldquo;a land force&rdquo; are substituted for 32:2 (as applicable to Army National Guard). The National Defense Act of 1916, &sect;117 (last 66 words), 39 Stat. 212, is not contained in 32:2. It is also omitted from the revised section as repealed by the Act of February 28, 1925, ch. 374, &sect;3, 43 Stat. 1081.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (10) and (11), the word &ldquo;Army&rdquo; is inserted to distinguish the organizations defined from their Air Force counterparts.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (10) and (12), the words &ldquo;unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires&rdquo; and &ldquo;as provided in this title&rdquo;, in 32:4b, are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (10)(B) and (12)(B), the words &ldquo;has its officers appointed&rdquo; are substituted for the word &ldquo;officered&rdquo;, in 32:4b.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (11) and (13), only that much of the description of the composition of the Army National Guard of the United States and the Air National Guard of the United States is used as is necessary to distinguish these reserve components, respectively, from the other reserve components.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (12)(A), the words &ldquo;an air force&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;for which Federal responsibility has been vested in the Secretary of the Air Force or the Department of the Air Force pursuant to law&rdquo;, in 10:1835, and for 32:2 (as applicable to Air National Guard), to make the definition of &ldquo;Air National Guard&rdquo; parallel with the definition of &ldquo;Army National Guard&rdquo;, and to make explicit the intent of Congress, in creating the Air National Guard, that the organized militia henceforth should consist of three mutually exhaustive classes comprising the Army, Air, and Naval militia.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (14), the definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; is based on the source statutes instead of 50:551(5), which excludes warrant officers. The reference to appointment in 10:1a(b) (2d sentence and 10:1801(b) (2d sentence), and the words &ldquo;commissioned warrant officer&rdquo;, &ldquo;flight officer&rdquo;, and &ldquo;either permanent or temporary&rdquo;, in 37:231(c) (1st sentence), are omitted as surplusage. 5:181&ndash;3(b) (1st sentence), 10:1a(b) (1st sentence), and 10:1801(b) (1st sentence) are omitted as covered by the definitions in clauses (14) and (16) of the revised section and by section 3062(c) and section 8062(d) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1988 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (k) is based on Pub. L. 100&ndash;202, &sect;101(b) [title VIII, &sect;8042], 101 Stat. 1329&ndash;69.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 8042 of the FY88 Defense Appropriations Act (Public Law 100&ndash;202) established a requirement for the Secretary of Defense to submit an annual report on the cost of stationing United States forces overseas. Under that section, the annual report is to be sent to the Committees on Appropriations of the two Houses. In codifying that section as section 113(k) of title 10, the committee added the two Armed Services Committees as committees to be sent the annual report. This minor change from the source law does not change the nature of the report to be submitted.</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee notes that the source section does not specify the period of time to be covered by the report. In the absence of statutory language specifying the period to be covered by the report, it would seem reasonable to conclude that the report should cover the previous fiscal year. The committee notes, however, that the report of the Senate Appropriations Committee on its FY88 defense appropriations bill (S. Rpt. 100&ndash;235) states that this new annual report &ldquo;should cover the budget years and the 2 previous fiscal years&rdquo; (page 54). The committee believes that such a requirement may be unnecessarily burdensome and in any case, if such a requirement is intended, should be stated in the statute. In the absence of clear intent, the provision is proposed to be codified without specifying the period of time to be covered by the annual report.</p>
<p class="note-body">In codifying this provision, the committee also changed the term &ldquo;United States troops&rdquo; in the source law to &ldquo;United States forces&rdquo; for consistency in usage in title 10 and as being preferable usage. No change in meaning is intended. The committee also changed &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; to &ldquo;outside the United States&rdquo; and defined &ldquo;United States&rdquo; for this purpose to include the territories and possessions of the United States. The committee was concerned that the term &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; read literally could include Hawaii or Guam, an interpretation clearly not intended in enacting section 8042. The committee notes that the Senate report referred to above states &ldquo;For the purposes of this report [meaning <!-- PDFPage:33 -->the new DOD annual report], U.S. forces stationed overseas are considered to be those outside of the United States and its territories.&rdquo;. The committee extrapolates from this statement that provisions in the report requirement relating to expenditures &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; and costs incurred &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; are also to be construed as relating to matters outside the United States and its territories and has prepared the codified provision accordingly.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Annual Report on Moratorium on Use by Armed Forces of Antipersonnel Landmines</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 1309 of Pub. L. 105&ndash;85 provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The United States has stated its support for a ban on antipersonnel landmines that is global in scope and verifiable.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) On May 16, 1996, the President announced that the United States, as a matter of policy, would eliminate its stockpile of non-self-destructing antipersonnel landmines, except those used for training purposes and in Korea, and that the United States would reserve the right to use self-destructing antipersonnel landmines in the event of conflict.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) On May 16, 1996, the President also announced that the United States would lead an effort to negotiate an international treaty permanently banning the use of all antipersonnel landmines.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The United States is currently participating at the United Nations Conference on Disarmament in negotiations aimed at achieving a global ban on the use of antipersonnel landmines.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) On August 18, 1997, the administration agreed to participate in international negotiations sponsored by Canada (the so-called &lsquo;Ottawa process&rsquo;) designed to achieve a treaty that would outlaw the production, use, and sale of antipersonnel landmines.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) On September 17, 1997, the President announced that the United States would not sign the antipersonnel landmine treaty concluded in Oslo, Norway, by participants in the Ottawa process because the treaty would not provide a geographic exception to allow the United States to stockpile and use antipersonnel landmines in Korea or an exemption that would preserve the ability of the United States to use mixed antitank mine systems which could be used to deter an armored assault against United States forces.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The President also announced a change in United States policy whereby the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) would no longer deploy antipersonnel landmines, including self-destructing antipersonnel landmines, by 2003, except in Korea;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) would seek to field alternatives by that date, or by 2006 in the case of Korea;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) would undertake a new initiative in the United Nations Conference on Disarmament to establish a global ban on the transfer of antipersonnel landmines; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) would increase its current humanitarian demining activities around the world.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The President's decision would allow the continued use by United States forces of self-destructing antipersonnel landmines that are used as part of a mixed antitank mine system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Under existing law (as provided in section 580 of Public Law 104&ndash;107; 110 Stat. 751), on February 12, 1999, the United States will implement a one-year moratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines by United States forces except along internationally recognized national borders or in demilitarized zones within a perimeter marked area that is monitored by military personnel and protected by adequate means to ensure the exclusion of civilians.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Sense of Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:60 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the United States should not implement a moratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines by United States Armed Forces in a manner that would endanger United States personnel or undermine the military effectiveness of United States Armed Forces in executing their missions; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the United States should pursue the development of alternatives to self-destructing antipersonnel landmines.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Annual Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than December 31 each year, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense committees [Committees on Armed Services and Appropriations of Senate and House of Representatives] a report concerning antipersonnel landmines.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The military utility of the continued deployment and use by the United States of antipersonnel landmines.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The effect of a moratorium on the production, stockpiling, and use of antipersonnel landmines on the ability of United States forces to deter and defend against attack on land by hostile forces, including on the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Progress in developing and fielding systems that are effective substitutes for antipersonnel landmines, including an identification and description of the types of systems that are being developed and fielded, the costs associated with those systems, and the estimated timetable for developing and fielding those systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The effect of a moratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines on the military effectiveness of current antitank mine systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The number and type of pure antipersonnel landmines that remain in the United States inventory and that are subject to elimination under the President's September 17, 1997, declaration on United States antipersonnel landmine policy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The number and type of mixed antitank mine systems that are in the United States inventory, the locations where they are deployed, and their effect on the deterrence and warfighting ability of United States Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The effect of the elimination of pure antipersonnel landmines on the warfighting effectiveness of the United States Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The costs already incurred and anticipated of eliminating antipersonnel landmines from the United States inventory in accordance with the policy enunciated by the President on September 17, 1997.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;123. Authority to suspend officer personnel laws during war or national emergency</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In time of war, or of national emergency declared by Congress or the President after November 30, 1980, the President may suspend the operation of any provision of law relating to the promotion, involuntary retirement, or separation of commissioned officers of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard Reserve. So long as such war or national emergency continues, any such suspension may be extended by the President.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Any such suspension shall, if not sooner ended, end on the last day of the two-year period beginning on the date on which the suspension (or the last extension thereof) takes effect or on the last day of the one-year period beginning on the date of the termination of the war or national emergency, whichever occurs first. With respect to the end of any such suspension, the preceding sentence supersedes the provisions of title II of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1621&ndash;1622) which provide that powers or authorities exercised by reason of a national emergency shall cease to be exercised after the date of the termination of the emergency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If a provision of law pertaining to the promotion of reserve officers is suspended under this section and if the Secretary of Defense submits to Congress proposed legislation to adjust the grades and dates of rank of reserve commissioned officers other than commissioned warrant officers, such proposed legislation shall, so far as practicable, be the same as that recommended for adjusting the grades and dates of rank of officers of the regular component of the armed force concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Upon the termination of a suspension made under the authority of subsection (a) of a provision of law otherwise requiring the separation or retirement of officers on active duty because of age, length of service or length of service in grade, or failure of selection for promotion, the Secretary concerned shall extend by up to 90 days the otherwise required separation or retirement date of any officer covered by the suspended provision whose separation or retirement date, but for the suspension, would have been before the date of the termination of the suspension or within 90 days after the date of such termination.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) As part of transformation efforts within the Department of Defense, each of the Armed Forces is developing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities that best support future war fighting as envisioned by the leadership of the military department concerned.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Concurrently, intelligence agencies of the Department of Defense outside the military departments are developing transformation roadmaps to best support the future decisionmaking and war fighting needs of their principal customers, but are not always closely coordinating those efforts with the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance development efforts of the military departments.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) A senior official of each military department has been designated as the integrator of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance for each of the Armed Forces in such military department, but there is not currently a well-defined forum through which the integrators of intelligence, surveillance, and re<!-- PDFPage:220 -->connaissance capabilities for each of the Armed Forces can routinely interact with each other and with senior representatives of Department of Defense intelligence agencies, as well as with other members of the intelligence community, to ensure unity of effort and to preclude unnecessary duplication of effort.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The current funding structure of a National Foreign Intelligence Program (NFIP), Joint Military Intelligence Program (JMIP), and Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities Program (TIARA) may not be the best approach for supporting the development of an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance structure that is integrated to meet the national security requirements of the United States in the 21st century.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The position of Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence was established in 2002 by Public Law 107&ndash;314 [see 10 U.S.C. 137] in order to facilitate resolution of the challenges to achieving an integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance structure in the Department of Defense to meet such 21st century requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Goal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It shall be a goal of the Department of Defense to fully integrate the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities and coordinate the developmental activities of the military departments, intelligence agencies of the Department of Defense, and relevant combatant commands as those departments, agencies, and commands transform their intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems to meet current and future needs.&rdquo;</p>
