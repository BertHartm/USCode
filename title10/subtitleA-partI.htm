<p class="note-body">The definitions in clauses (3), (15), (18)&ndash;(21), (23)&ndash;(30), and (31)&ndash;(33) reflect the adoption of terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes restated in this title, represents the closest practicable approximation of the ways in which the terms defined have been most commonly used. A choice has been made where established uses conflict.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (2), the definition of &ldquo;Territory&rdquo; in 32:4c is executed throughout this revised title by specific reference, where applicable, to the Territories, Puerto Rico and the Canal Zone.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (4), the definition of &ldquo;armed forces&rdquo; is based on the source statute instead of 50:551(2), which does not include an express reference to the Marine Corps. The words &ldquo;including all components thereof&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (5), the term &ldquo;Department&rdquo; is defined to give it the broad sense of &ldquo;Establishment&rdquo;, to conform to the source statute and the usage preferred by the Department of Defense, instead of the more limited sense defined by 5:421g(a) and 423a(a), and 10:1a(d) and 1801(d).</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (6), the term &ldquo;executive part of the department&rdquo; is created for convenience in referring to what is described in the source statutes for this title as &ldquo;department&rdquo; in the limited sense of the executive part at the seat of government. This is required by the adoption of the word &ldquo;department&rdquo; in clause (5) to cover the broader concept of &ldquo;establishment&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (8), the term &ldquo;Secretary concerned&rdquo; is created and defined for legislative convenience.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (9), a definition of &ldquo;National Guard&rdquo; is inserted for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (10)(A), the words &ldquo;a land force&rdquo; are substituted for 32:2 (as applicable to Army National Guard). The National Defense Act of 1916, &sect;117 (last 66 words), 39 Stat. 212, is not contained in 32:2. It is also omitted from the revised section as repealed by the Act of February 28, 1925, ch. 374, &sect;3, 43 Stat. 1081.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (10) and (11), the word &ldquo;Army&rdquo; is inserted to distinguish the organizations defined from their Air Force counterparts.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (10) and (12), the words &ldquo;unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires&rdquo; and &ldquo;as provided in this title&rdquo;, in 32:4b, are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (10)(B) and (12)(B), the words &ldquo;has its officers appointed&rdquo; are substituted for the word &ldquo;officered&rdquo;, in 32:4b.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (11) and (13), only that much of the description of the composition of the Army National Guard of the United States and the Air National Guard of the United States is used as is necessary to distinguish these reserve components, respectively, from the other reserve components.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (12)(A), the words &ldquo;an air force&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;for which Federal responsibility has been vested in the Secretary of the Air Force or the Department of the Air Force pursuant to law&rdquo;, in 10:1835, and for 32:2 (as applicable to Air National Guard), to make the definition of &ldquo;Air National Guard&rdquo; parallel with the definition of &ldquo;Army National Guard&rdquo;, and to make explicit the intent of Congress, in creating the Air National Guard, that the organized militia henceforth should consist of three mutually exhaustive classes comprising the Army, Air, and Naval militia.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (14), the definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; is based on the source statutes instead of 50:551(5), which excludes warrant officers. The reference to appointment in 10:1a(b) (2d sentence and 10:1801(b) (2d sentence), and the words &ldquo;commissioned warrant officer&rdquo;, &ldquo;flight officer&rdquo;, and &ldquo;either permanent or temporary&rdquo;, in 37:231(c) (1st sentence), are omitted as surplusage. 5:181&ndash;3(b) (1st sentence), 10:1a(b) (1st sentence), and 10:1801(b) (1st sentence) are omitted as covered by the definitions in clauses (14) and (16) of the revised section and by section 3062(c) and section 8062(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (16), the words &ldquo;unless otherwise qualified&rdquo;, &ldquo;permanent or temporary&rdquo;, and &ldquo;in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard, including any component thereof&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body"> In clause (22), the definition of &ldquo;active duty&rdquo; is based on the definition of &ldquo;active Federal service&rdquo; in the source statute, since it is believed to be closer to general usage than the definition in 50:901(b), which excludes active duty for training from the general concept of active duty.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Military Force Structure Review</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 104&ndash;201, div. A, title IX, subtitle B, Sept. 23, 1996, 110 Stat. 2623, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 921. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This subtitle may be cited as the &lsquo;Military Force Structure Review Act of 1996&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 922. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States has conducted two substantial assessments of the force structure of the Armed Forces necessary to meet United States defense requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The assessment by the Bush Administration (known as the &lsquo;Base Force&rsquo; assessment) and the assessment by the Clinton Administration (known as the &lsquo;Bottom-Up Review&rsquo;) were intended to reassess the force structure of the Armed Forces in light of the changing realities of the post-Cold War world.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Both assessments served an important purpose in focusing attention on the need to reevaluate the military posture of the United States, but the pace of global change necessitates a new, comprehensive assessment of the defense strategy of the United States and the force structure of the Armed Forces required to meet the threats to the United States in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The Bottom-Up Review has been criticized on several points, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the assumptions underlying the strategy of planning to fight and win two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) the force levels recommended to carry out that strategy; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) the funding proposed for such recommended force levels.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) In response to the recommendations of the Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces, the Secretary of Defense endorsed the concept of conducting a quadrennial review of the defense program at the beginning of each newly elected Presidential administration, and the Department intends to complete the first such review in 1997.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The review is to involve a comprehensive examination of defense strategy, the force structure of the active, guard, and reserve components, force modernization plans, infrastructure, and other elements of the defense program and policies in order to determine and express the defense strategy of the United States and to establish a revised defense program through the year 2005.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) In order to ensure that the force structure of the Armed Forces is adequate to meet the challenges to the national security interests of the United States in the twenty-first century, to assist the Secretary of Defense in conducting the review referred to in paragraph (5), and to assess the appropriate force structure of the Armed Forces through the year 2010 and beyond (if practicable), it is important to provide for the conduct of an independent, nonpartisan review of the force structure that is more comprehensive than prior assessments of the force structure, extends beyond the quadrennial defense review, and explores innovative and forward-thinking ways of meeting such challenges.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 923. QUADRENNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Requirement in</cap-smallcap> 1997.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, shall complete in 1997 a review of the defense program of the United States intended to satisfy the requirements for a Quadrennial Defense Review as identified in the recommendations of the Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces. The review shall include a comprehensive examination of the defense strategy, force structure, force modernization plans, infrastructure, budget plan, and other elements of the defense program and policies with a view toward determining and expressing the defense strategy of the United States and establishing a revised defense program through the year 2005.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Involvement of National Defense Panel</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall apprise the National Defense Panel established under section 924, on an ongoing basis, of the work undertaken in the conduct of the review.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Assessments of Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon completion of the review, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chairman of the National Defense Panel, on behalf of the Panel, shall each prepare and submit to the Secretary such Chairman's assessment of the review in time for the inclusion of the assessment in its entirety in the report under subsection (d).</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than May 15, 1997, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives a comprehensive report on the review. The report shall include the following:</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The threats examined for purposes of the review and the scenarios developed in the examination of such threats.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The assumptions used in the review, including assumptions relating to the cooperation of allies and mission-sharing, levels of acceptable risk, warning times, and intensity and duration of conflict.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The effect on the force structure of preparations for and participation in peace operations and military operations other than war.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The effect on the force structure of the utilization by the Armed Forces of technologies anticipated to be available by the year 2005, including precision guided munitions, stealth, night vision, digitization, and communications, and the changes in doctrine and operational concepts that would result from the utilization of such technologies.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The manpower and sustainment policies required under the defense strategy to support engagement in conflicts lasting more than 120 days.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The anticipated roles and missions of the reserve components in the defense strategy and the strength, capabilities, and equipment necessary to assure that the reserve components can capably discharge those roles and missions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The appropriate ratio of combat forces to support forces (commonly referred to as the &lsquo;tooth-to-tail&rsquo; ratio) under the defense strategy, including, in particular, the appropriate number and size of headquarter units and Defense Agencies for that purpose.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The air-lift and sea-lift capabilities required to support the defense strategy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) The forward presence, pre-positioning, and other anticipatory deployments necessary under the defense strategy for conflict deterrence and adequate military response to anticipated conflicts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) The extent to which resources must be shifted among two or more theaters under the defense strategy in the event of conflict in such theaters.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) The advisability of revisions to the Unified Command Plan as a result of the defense strategy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) Any other matter the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 951. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The current allocation of roles and missions among the Armed Forces evolved from the practice during World War II to meet the Cold War threat and may no longer be appropriate for the post-Cold War era.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Many analysts believe that a realignment of those roles and mission [sic] is essential for the efficiency and effectiveness of the Armed Forces, particularly in light of lower budgetary resources that will be available to the Department of Defense in the future.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The existing process of a triennial review of roles and missions by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff pursuant to provisions of law enacted by the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 [see Short Title of 1986 Amendment note above] has not produced the comprehensive review envisioned by Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) It is difficult for any organization, and may be particularly difficult for the Department of Defense, to reform itself without the benefit and authority provided by external perspectives and analysis.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) exploitation of new technology and operational concepts;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1988 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (k) is based on Pub. L. 100&ndash;202, &sect;101(b) [title VIII, &sect;8042], 101 Stat. 1329&ndash;69.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 8042 of the FY88 Defense Appropriations Act (Public Law 100&ndash;202) established a requirement for the Secretary of Defense to submit an annual report on the cost of stationing United States forces overseas. Under that section, the annual report is to be sent to the Committees on Appropriations of the two Houses. In codifying that section as section 113(k) of title 10, the committee added the two Armed Services Committees as committees to be sent the annual report. This minor change from the source law does not change the nature of the report to be submitted.</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee notes that the source section does not specify the period of time to be covered by the report. In the absence of statutory language specifying the period to be covered by the report, it would seem reasonable to conclude that the report should cover the previous fiscal year. The committee notes, however, that the report of the Senate Appropriations Committee on its FY88 defense appropriations bill (S. Rpt. 100&ndash;235) states that this new annual report &ldquo;should cover the budget years and the 2 previous fiscal years&rdquo; (page 54). The committee believes that such a requirement may be unnecessarily burdensome and in any case, if such a requirement is intended, should be stated in the statute. In the absence of clear intent, the provision is proposed to be codified without specifying the period of time to be covered by the annual report.</p>
<p class="note-body">In codifying this provision, the committee also changed the term &ldquo;United States troops&rdquo; in the source law to &ldquo;United States forces&rdquo; for consistency in usage in title 10 and as being preferable usage. No change in meaning is intended. The committee also changed &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; to &ldquo;outside the United States&rdquo; and defined &ldquo;United States&rdquo; for this purpose to include the territories and possessions of the United States. The committee was concerned that the term &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; read literally could include Hawaii or Guam, an interpretation clearly not intended in enacting section 8042. The committee notes that the Senate report referred to above states &ldquo;For the purposes of this report [meaning the new DOD annual report], U.S. forces stationed overseas are considered to be those outside of the United States and its territories.&rdquo;. The committee extrapolates from this statement that provisions in the report requirement relating to expenditures &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; and costs incurred &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; are also to be construed as relating to matters outside the United States and its territories and has prepared the codified provision accordingly.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;123. Authority to suspend officer personnel laws during war or national emergency</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In time of war, or of national emergency declared by Congress or the President after November 30, 1980, the President may suspend the operation of any provision of law relating to the promotion, involuntary retirement, or separation of commissioned officers of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard Reserve. So long as such war or national emergency continues, any such suspension may be extended by the President.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Any such suspension shall, if not sooner ended, end on the last day of the two-year period beginning on the date on which the suspension (or the last extension thereof) takes effect or on the last day of the one-year period beginning on the date of the termination of the war or national emergency, whichever occurs first. With respect to the end of any such suspension, the preceding sentence supersedes the provisions of title II of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1621&ndash;1622) which provide that powers or authorities exercised by reason of a national emergency shall cease to be exercised after the date of the termination of the emergency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If a provision of law pertaining to the promotion of reserve officers is suspended under <!-- PDFPage:65 -->this section and if the Secretary of Defense submits to Congress proposed legislation to adjust the grades and dates of rank of reserve commissioned officers other than commissioned warrant officers, such proposed legislation shall, so far as practicable, be the same as that recommended for adjusting the grades and dates of rank of officers of the regular component of the armed force concerned.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Subject to the limitations of subsection (c), and within the limitation of appropriations made for the purpose, the Secretary of Defense, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, and the Secretary of a military department within his department, may provide for any emergency or extraordinary expense which cannot be anticipated or classified. When it is so provided in such an appropriation, the funds may be spent on approval or authority of the Secretary concerned or the Inspector General for any purpose he determines to be proper, and such a determination is final and conclusive upon the accounting officers of the United States. The Secretary concerned or the Inspector General may certify the amount of any such expenditure authorized by him that he considers advisable not to specify, and his certificate is sufficient voucher for the expenditure of that amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The authority conferred by this section may be delegated by the Secretary of Defense to any person in the Department of Defense, by the Inspector General to any person in the Office of the Inspector General, or by the Secretary of a military department to any person within his department, with or without the authority to make successive redelegations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Funds may not be obligated or expended in an amount in excess of $500,000 under the authority of subsection (a) or (b) until the Secretary of Defense has notified the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on National Security and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives of the intent to obligate or expend the funds, and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of an obligation or expenditure in excess of $1,000,000, 15 days have elapsed since the date of the notification; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of an obligation or expenditure in excess of $500,000, but not in excess of $1,000,000, 5 days have elapsed since the date of the notification.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) shall not apply to an obligation or expenditure of funds otherwise covered by such subparagraph if the Secretary of Defense determines that the national security objectives of the United States will be compromised by the application of the subparagraph to the obligation or expenditure. If the Secretary makes a determination with respect to an obligation or expenditure under the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall immediately notify the committees referred to in paragraph (1) that such obligation or expenditure is necessary and provide any relevant information (in classified form, if necessary) jointly to the chairman and ranking minority member (or their designees) of such committees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A notification under paragraph (1) and information referred to in paragraph (2) shall include the amount to be obligated or expended, as the case may be, and the purpose of the obligation or expenditure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In any case in which funds are expended under the authority of subsections (a) and (b), the Secretary of Defense shall submit a report of such expenditures on a quarterly basis to the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on National Security and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;127a. Operations for which funds are not provided in advance: funding mechanisms</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall use the procedures prescribed by this section with respect to any operation specified in paragraph (2) that involves&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the deployment (other than for a training exercise) of elements of the Armed Forces for a purpose other than a purpose for which funds have been specifically provided in advance; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the provision of humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, or support for law enforcement (including immigration control) for which funds have not been specifically provided in advance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section applies to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any operation the incremental cost of which is expected to exceed $50,000,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any other operation the expected incremental cost of which, when added to the expected incremental costs of other operations that are currently ongoing, is expected to result in a cumulative incremental cost of ongoing operations of the Department of Defense in excess of $100,000,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any operation the incremental cost of which is expected not to exceed $10,000,000 shall be disregarded for the purposes of subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever an operation to which this section applies is commenced or subsequently becomes covered by this section, the Secretary of Defense shall designate and identify that operation for the purposes of this section and shall promptly notify Congress of that designation (and of the identification of the operation).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This section does not provide authority for the President or the Secretary of Defense to carry out any operation, but establishes mechanisms for the Department of Defense by which funds are provided for operations that the armed forces are required to carry out under some other authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Waiver of Requirement To Reimburse Support Units</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall direct that, when a unit of the Armed Forces participating in an operation described in subsection (a) receives services from an element of the Department of Defense that operates through the Defense Business Operations Fund (or a successor fund), such unit of the Armed Forces may not be required to reimburse that element for the incremental costs incurred by that element in providing such services, notwithstanding any other provision of law or any Government accounting practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amounts which but for paragraph (1) would be required to be reimbursed to an element of the Department of Defense (or a fund) shall be recorded as an expense attributable to the operation and shall be accounted for separately.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Transfer Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Whenever there is an operation of the Department of Defense described in subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense may transfer amounts described in paragraph (3) to accounts from which incremental expenses for that operation were incurred in order to reimburse those accounts for those incremental expenses. Amounts so transferred shall be merged with and be available for the same purposes as the accounts to which transferred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The total amount that the Secretary of Defense may transfer under the authority of this section in any fiscal year is $200,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Transfers under this subsection may only be made from amounts appropriated to the Department of Defense for any fiscal year that remain available for obligation, other than amounts within any operation and maintenance appropriation that are available for (A) an account (known as a budget activity 1 account) that is specified as being for operating forces, or (B) an account (known as a budget activity 2 account) that is specified as being for mobilization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The authority provided by this subsection is in addition to any other authority provided by law authorizing the transfer of amounts available to the Department of Defense. However, the Secretary may not use any such authority under another provision of law for a purpose described in paragraph (1) if there is authority available under this subsection for that purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The authority provided by this subsection to transfer amounts may not be used to provide authority for an activity that has been denied authorization by Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) A transfer made from one account to another under the authority of this subsection shall be deemed to increase the amount authorized for the account to which the amount is transferred by an amount equal to the amount transferred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Report Upon Designation of an Operation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Within 45 days after the Secretary of Defense identifies an operation pursuant to subsection (a)(2), the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report that sets forth the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The manner by which the Secretary proposes to obtain funds for the cost to the United States of the operation, including a specific discussion of how the Secretary proposes to restore balances in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Defense Business Operations Fund (or a successor fund), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the accounts from which the Secretary transfers funds under the authority of subsection (c), to the levels that would have been anticipated but for the provisions of subsection (c).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If the operation is described in subsection (a)(1)(B), a justification why the budgetary resources of another department or agency of the Federal Government, instead of resources of the Department of Defense, are not being used for carrying out the operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The objectives of the operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The estimated duration of the operation and of any deployment of armed forces personnel in such operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The estimated incremental cost of the operation to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The exit criteria for the operation and for the withdrawal of the elements of the armed forces involved in the operation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:71 --><p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may not restore balances in the Defense Business Operations Fund through increases in rates charged by that fund in order to compensate for costs incurred and not reimbursed due to subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not restore balances in the Defense Business Operations Fund or any other fund or account through the use of unobligated amounts in an operation and maintenance appropriation that are available within that appropriation for (A) an account (known as a budget activity 1 account) that is specified as being for operating forces, or (B) an account (known as a budget activity 2 account) that is specified as being for mobilization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Submission of Requests for Supplemental Appropriations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that whenever there is an operation described in subsection (a), the President should, not later than 90 days after the date on which notification is provided pursuant to subsection (a)(3), submit to Congress a request for the enactment of supplemental appropriations for the then-current fiscal year in order to provide funds to replenish the Defense Business Operations Fund or any other fund or account of the Department of Defense from which funds for the incremental expenses of that operation were derived under this section and should, as necessary, submit subsequent requests for the enactment of such appropriations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Incremental Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this section, incremental costs of the Department of Defense with respect to an operation are the costs of the Department that are directly attributable to the operation (and would not have been incurred but for the operation). Incremental costs do not include the cost of property or services acquired by the Department that are paid for by a source outside the Department or out of funds contributed by such a source.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Relationship to War Powers Resolution</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section may not be construed as altering or superseding the War Powers Resolution. This section does not provide authority to conduct any military operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>GAO Compliance Reviews</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Comptroller General of the United States shall from time to time, and when requested by a committee of Congress, conduct a review of the defense funding structure under this section to determine whether the Department of Defense is complying with the requirements and limitations of this section.</p>
