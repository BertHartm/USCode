<p class="note-body">The definitions in clauses (3), (15), (18)&ndash;(21), (23)&ndash;(30), and (31)&ndash;(33) reflect the adoption of terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes restated in this title, represents the closest practicable approximation of the ways in which the terms defined have been most commonly used. A choice has been made where established uses conflict.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (2), the definition of &ldquo;Territory&rdquo; in 32:4c is executed throughout this revised title by specific reference, where applicable, to the Territories, Puerto Rico and the Canal Zone.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (4), the definition of &ldquo;armed forces&rdquo; is based on the source statute instead of 50:551(2), which does not include an express reference to the Marine Corps. The words &ldquo;including all components thereof&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (5), the term &ldquo;Department&rdquo; is defined to give it the broad sense of &ldquo;Establishment&rdquo;, to conform to the source statute and the usage preferred by the Department of Defense, instead of the more limited sense defined by 5:421g(a) and 423a(a), and 10:1a(d) and 1801(d).</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (6), the term &ldquo;executive part of the department&rdquo; is created for convenience in referring to what is described in the source statutes for this title as &ldquo;department&rdquo; in the limited sense of the executive part at the seat of government. This is required by the adoption of the word &ldquo;department&rdquo; in clause (5) to cover the broader concept of &ldquo;establishment&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (8), the term &ldquo;Secretary concerned&rdquo; is created and defined for legislative convenience.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (9), a definition of &ldquo;National Guard&rdquo; is inserted for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (10)(A), the words &ldquo;a land force&rdquo; are substituted for 32:2 (as applicable to Army National Guard). The National Defense Act of 1916, &sect;117 (last 66 words), 39 Stat. 212, is not contained in 32:2. It is also omitted from the revised section as repealed by the Act of February 28, 1925, ch. 374, &sect;3, 43 Stat. 1081.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (10) and (11), the word &ldquo;Army&rdquo; is inserted to distinguish the organizations defined from their Air Force counterparts.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (10) and (12), the words &ldquo;unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires&rdquo; and &ldquo;as provided in this title&rdquo;, in 32:4b, are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (10)(B) and (12)(B), the words &ldquo;has its officers appointed&rdquo; are substituted for the word &ldquo;officered&rdquo;, in 32:4b.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (11) and (13), only that much of the description of the composition of the Army National Guard of the United States and the Air National Guard of the United States is used as is necessary to distinguish these reserve components, respectively, from the other reserve components.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (12)(A), the words &ldquo;an air force&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;for which Federal responsibility has been vested in the Secretary of the Air Force or the Department of the Air Force pursuant to law&rdquo;, in 10:1835, and for 32:2 (as applicable to Air National Guard), to make the definition of &ldquo;Air National Guard&rdquo; parallel with the definition of &ldquo;Army National Guard&rdquo;, and to make explicit the intent of Congress, in creating the Air National Guard, that the organized militia henceforth should consist of three mutually exhaustive classes comprising the Army, Air, and Naval militia.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (14), the definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; is based on the source statutes instead of 50:551(5), which excludes warrant officers. The reference to appointment in 10:1a(b) (2d sentence and 10:1801(b) (2d sentence), and the words &ldquo;commissioned warrant officer&rdquo;, &ldquo;flight officer&rdquo;, and &ldquo;either permanent or temporary&rdquo;, in 37:231(c) (1st sentence), are omitted as surplusage. 5:181&ndash;3(b) (1st sentence), 10:1a(b) (1st sentence), and 10:1801(b) (1st sentence) are omitted as covered by the definitions in clauses (14) and (16) of the revised section and by section 3062(c) and section 8062(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (16), the words &ldquo;unless otherwise qualified&rdquo;, &ldquo;permanent or temporary&rdquo;, and &ldquo;in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard, including any component thereof&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body"> In clause (22), the definition of &ldquo;active duty&rdquo; is based on the definition of &ldquo;active Federal service&rdquo; in the source statute, since it is believed to be closer to general usage than the definition in 50:901(b), which excludes active duty for training from the general concept of active duty.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Many analysts believe that a realignment of those roles and mission [sic] is essential for the efficiency and effectiveness of the Armed Forces, particularly in light of lower budgetary resources that will be available to the Department of Defense in the future.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The existing process of a triennial review of roles and missions by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff pursuant to provisions of law enacted by the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 [see Short Title of 1986 Amendment note above] has not produced the comprehensive review envisioned by Congress.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1988 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (k) is based on Pub. L. 100&ndash;202, &sect;101(b) [title VIII, &sect;8042], 101 Stat. 1329&ndash;69.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 8042 of the FY88 Defense Appropriations Act (Public Law 100&ndash;202) established a requirement for the Secretary of Defense to submit an annual report on the cost of stationing United States forces overseas. Under that section, the annual report is to be sent to the Committees on Appropriations of the two Houses. In codifying that section as section 113(k) of title 10, the committee added the two Armed Services Committees as committees to be sent the annual report. This minor change from the source law does not change the nature of the report to be submitted.</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee notes that the source section does not specify the period of time to be covered by the report. In the absence of statutory language specifying the period to be covered by the report, it would seem reasonable to conclude that the report should cover the previous fiscal year. The committee notes, however, that the report of the Senate Appropriations Committee on its FY88 defense appropriations bill (S. Rpt. 100&ndash;235) states that this new annual report &ldquo;should cover the budget years and the 2 previous fiscal years&rdquo; (page 54). The committee believes that such a requirement may be unnecessarily burdensome and in any case, if such a requirement is intended, should be stated in the statute. In the absence of clear intent, the provision is proposed to be codified without specifying the period of time to be covered by the annual report.</p>
<p class="note-body">In codifying this provision, the committee also changed the term &ldquo;United States troops&rdquo; in the source law to &ldquo;United States forces&rdquo; for consistency in usage in title 10 and as being preferable usage. No change in meaning is intended. The committee also changed &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; to &ldquo;outside the United States&rdquo; and defined &ldquo;United States&rdquo; for this purpose to include the territories and possessions of the United States. The committee was concerned that the term &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; read literally could include Hawaii or Guam, an interpretation clearly not intended in enacting section 8042. The committee notes that the Senate report referred to above states &ldquo;For the purposes of this report [meaning the new DOD annual report], U.S. forces stationed overseas are considered to be those outside of the United States and its territories.&rdquo;. The committee extrapolates from this statement that provisions in the report requirement relating to expenditures &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; and costs incurred &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; are also to be construed as relating to matters outside the United States and its territories and has prepared the codified provision accordingly.</p>

<h4 class="italic-text-head">&sect;123. Authority to suspend officer personnel laws during war or national emergency</h4>
<p class="italic-text-para">(a) In time of war, or of national emergency declared by Congress or the President after November 30, 1980, the President may suspend the operation of any provision of law relating to the promotion, involuntary retirement, or separation of commissioned officers of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard Reserve. So long as such war or national emergency continues, any such suspension may be extended by the President.</p>
<p class="italic-text-para">(b) Any such suspension shall, if not sooner ended, end on the last day of the two-year period beginning on the date on which the suspension (or the last extension thereof) takes effect or on the last day of the one-year period beginning on the date of the termination of the war or national emergency, whichever occurs first. With respect to the end of any such suspension, the preceding sentence supersedes the provisions of title II of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1621&ndash;1622) which provide that powers or authorities exercised by reason of a national emergency shall cease to be exercised after the date of the termination of the emergency.</p>

Whenever the Secretary designates an operation as a National Contingency Operation, the Secretary shall promptly transmit notice of that designation in writing to Congress. This section does not provide authority for the President or the Secretary of Defense to carry out an operation, but applies to the Department of Defense mechanisms by which funds are provided for operations that the armed forces are required to carry out under some other authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Waiver of Requirement To Reimburse Support Units</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) When an operating unit of the armed forces participating in a National Contingency Operation receives support services from a support unit of the armed forces that operates through the Defense Business Operations Fund (or a successor fund), that operating unit need not reimburse that support unit for the incremental costs incurred by the support unit in providing such support, notwithstanding any other provision of law or Government accounting practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amounts which but for paragraph (1) would be required to be reimbursed to a support unit shall be recorded as an expense attributable to the operation and shall be accounted for separately.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The total of the unreimbursed sums for all National Contingency Operations may not exceed $300,000,000 at any one time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Financial Plan for Contingency Operations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Within two months of the beginning of any National Contingency Operation, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a financial plan for the operation that sets forth the manner by which the Secretary proposes to obtain funds for the full cost to the United States of the operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The plan shall specify in detail how the Secretary proposes to make the Defense Business Operations Fund (or a successor fund) whole again.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Incremental Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this section, incremental costs of the Department of Defense with respect to an operation are the costs that are directly attributable to the operation and that are otherwise chargeable to accounts available for operation and maintenance or for military personnel. Any costs which are otherwise chargeable to accounts available for procurement may not be considered to be incremental costs for purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Incremental Personnel Costs Account</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There is hereby established in the Department of Defense a reserve fund to be known as the &ldquo;National Contingency Operation Personnel Fund&rdquo;. Amounts in the fund shall be available for incremental military personnel costs attributable to a National Contingency Operation. Amounts in the fund remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Coordination With War Powers Resolution</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section may not be construed as altering or superseding the War Powers Resolution.
