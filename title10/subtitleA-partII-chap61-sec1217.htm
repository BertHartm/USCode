<p class="note-body">The revised section is inserted to reflect the limited definition of the word &ldquo;member&rdquo; in section 102(b) of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 231(b)).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1958 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Aviation cadets were omitted from chapter 61 because Title IV of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (formerly 37 U.S.C. 271 et seq.), which was the source law for this chapter, covered only members entitled to basic pay and it was believed that aviation cadets were not so entitled. However, the Comptroller General has ruled that aviation cadets are entitled to basic pay (30 Comp. Gen. 431). Accordingly, aviation cadets were covered by Title IV and should not be excepted from chapter 61.</p>
