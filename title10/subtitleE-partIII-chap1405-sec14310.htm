<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Removal by President</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The President may remove the name of any officer from a promotion list at any time before the date on which the officer is promoted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Removal for Withholding of Senate Advice and Consent</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Senate does not give its advice and consent to the appointment to the next higher grade of an officer whose name is on a list of officers approved by the President for promotion (except in the case of promotions to a reserve grade to which appointments may be made by the President alone), the name of that officer shall be removed from the list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Continued Eligibility for Promotion</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An officer whose name is removed from a list under subsection (a) or (b) continues to be eligible for consideration for promotion. If that officer is recommended for promotion by the next selection board convened for that officer's grade and competitive category and the officer is promoted, the Secretary of the military department concerned may, upon the promotion, grant the officer the same date of rank, the same effective date for the pay and allowances of the grade to which promoted, and the same position on the reserve active-status list, as the officer would have had if the officer's name had not been removed from the list.</p>
