An officer appointed as the Judge Advocate General or Assistant Judge Advocate General normally holds office for four years.

If an officer who is so appointed holds a lower regular grade, he shall be appointed in the regular grade of major general.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Judge Advocate General shall be appointed from those officers who at the time of appointment are members of the bar of a Federal court or the highest court of a State or Territory, and who have had at least eight years of experience in legal duties as commissioned officers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Judge Advocate General, in addition to other duties prescribed by law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is the legal adviser of the Secretary of the Army and of all officers and agencies of the Department of the Army;</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;In addition to duties elsewhere prescribed for him by law&rdquo;, in 10:62, are omitted as surplusage.

<h4 class="note-head">1958 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">The change corrects an inadvertence. The source statute for section 3036(c) of title 10 (the third sentence of sec. 513(a) of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 901), providing for a 4-year term of office, applied also to the Judge Advocate General and the Assistant Judge Advocate General. As restated in section 3036(c), it now applies only to the officers named in section 3036(b), which excludes the two officers named. For this reason, the effect of the source statute with respect to those officers is added to section 3037(a), relating to their appointment.</p>
