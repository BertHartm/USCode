<p class="note-body">In subsections (a) and (b), the word &ldquo;commissioned&rdquo; is inserted since, for the Army and the Air Force, the term &ldquo;officer&rdquo; is intended to have the same meaning in 50:739 as it has in the Uniform Code of Military Justice (article 4). For Navy warrant officers see section 6408 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;from his place of duty&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;at least&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;or more&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;by a court other than a court-martial or other military court&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;by the civil authorities&rdquo;.</p>
