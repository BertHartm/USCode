<h3 class="section-head">&sect;123. Authority to suspend officer personnel laws during war or national emergency</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In time of war, or of national emergency declared by Congress or the President after November 30, 1980, the President may suspend the operation of any provision of law relating to the promotion, involuntary retirement, or separation of commissioned officers of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard Reserve. So long as such war or national emergency continues, any such suspension may be extended by the President.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Any such suspension shall, if not sooner ended, end on the last day of the two-year period beginning on the date on which the suspension (or the last extension thereof) takes effect or on the last day of the one-year period beginning on the date of the termination of the war or national emergency, whichever occurs first. With respect to the end of any such suspension, the preceding sentence supersedes the provisions of title II of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1621&ndash;1622) which provide that powers or authorities exercised by reason of a national emergency shall cease to be exercised after the date of the termination of the emergency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If a provision of law pertaining to the promotion of reserve officers is suspended under this section and if the Secretary of Defense submits to Congress proposed legislation to adjust the grades and dates of rank of reserve commissioned officers other than commissioned warrant officers, such proposed legislation shall, so far as practicable, be the same as that rec<!-- PDFPage:73 -->ommended for adjusting the grades and dates of rank of officers of the regular component of the armed force concerned.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) When a function, power, or duty or an activity of a department or agency of the Department of Defense is transferred to another department or agency of that department, those civilian employees of the department or agency from which the transfer is made that the Secretary of Defense determines are needed to perform that function, power, or duty, or for that activity, as the case may be, may, with the approval of the President, be transferred to the department or agency to which that function, power, duty, or activity, as the case may be, is transferred. The authorized strength in civilian employees of a department or agency from which employees are transferred under this section is reduced by the number of employees so transferred. The authorized strength in civilian employees of a department or agency to which employees are transferred under this section is increased by the number of employees so transferred.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Subject to the limitations of subsection (c), and within the limitation of appropriations made for the purpose, the Secretary of Defense, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, and the Secretary of a military department within his department, may provide for any emergency or extraordinary expense which cannot be anticipated or classified. When it is so provided in such an appropriation, the funds may be spent on approval or authority of the Secretary concerned or the Inspector General for any purpose he determines to be proper, and such a determination is final and conclusive upon the accounting officers of the United States. The Secretary concerned or the Inspector General may certify the amount of any such expenditure authorized by him that he considers advisable not to specify, and his certificate is sufficient voucher for the expenditure of that amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The authority conferred by this section may be delegated by the Secretary of Defense to any person in the Department of Defense, by the Inspector General to any person in the Office of the Inspector General, or by the Secretary of a military department to any person within his department, with or without the authority to make successive redelegations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Funds may not be obligated or expended in an amount in excess of $500,000 under the authority of subsection (a) or (b) until the Secretary of Defense has notified the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on National Security and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives of the intent to obligate or expend the funds, and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of an obligation or expenditure in excess of $1,000,000, 15 days have elapsed since the date of the notification; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of an obligation or expenditure in excess of $500,000, but not in excess of $1,000,000, 5 days have elapsed since the date of the notification.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) shall not apply to an obligation or expenditure of funds otherwise covered by such subparagraph if the Secretary of Defense determines that the national security objectives of the United States will be compromised by the application of the subparagraph to the obligation or expenditure. If the Secretary makes a determination with respect to an obligation or expenditure under the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall immediately notify the committees referred to in paragraph (1) that such obligation or expenditure is necessary and provide any relevant information (in classified form, if necessary) jointly to the chairman and ranking minority member (or their designees) of such committees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A notification under paragraph (1) and information referred to in paragraph (2) shall include the amount to be obligated or expended, as the case may be, and the purpose of the obligation or expenditure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In any case in which funds are expended under the authority of subsections (a) and (b), the Secretary of Defense shall submit a report of such expenditures on a quarterly basis to the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on National Security and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;127a. Operations for which funds are not provided in advance: funding mechanisms</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall use the procedures prescribed by this sec<!-- PDFPage:78 -->tion with respect to any operation specified in paragraph (2) that involves&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the deployment (other than for a training exercise) of elements of the Armed Forces for a purpose other than a purpose for which funds have been specifically provided in advance; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the provision of humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, or support for law enforcement (including immigration control) for which funds have not been specifically provided in advance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section applies to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any operation the incremental cost of which is expected to exceed $50,000,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any other operation the expected incremental cost of which, when added to the expected incremental costs of other operations that are currently ongoing, is expected to result in a cumulative incremental cost of ongoing operations of the Department of Defense in excess of $100,000,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any operation the incremental cost of which is expected not to exceed $10,000,000 shall be disregarded for the purposes of subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever an operation to which this section applies is commenced or subsequently becomes covered by this section, the Secretary of Defense shall designate and identify that operation for the purposes of this section and shall promptly notify Congress of that designation (and of the identification of the operation).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This section does not provide authority for the President or the Secretary of Defense to carry out any operation, but establishes mechanisms for the Department of Defense by which funds are provided for operations that the armed forces are required to carry out under some other authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Waiver of Requirement To Reimburse Support Units</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall direct that, when a unit of the Armed Forces participating in an operation described in subsection (a) receives services from an element of the Department of Defense that operates through the Defense Business Operations Fund (or a successor fund), such unit of the Armed Forces may not be required to reimburse that element for the incremental costs incurred by that element in providing such services, notwithstanding any other provision of law or any Government accounting practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amounts which but for paragraph (1) would be required to be reimbursed to an element of the Department of Defense (or a fund) shall be recorded as an expense attributable to the operation and shall be accounted for separately.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Transfer Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Whenever there is an operation of the Department of Defense described in subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense may transfer amounts described in paragraph (3) to accounts from which incremental expenses for that operation were incurred in order to reimburse those accounts for those incremental expenses. Amounts so transferred shall be merged with and be available for the same purposes as the accounts to which transferred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The total amount that the Secretary of Defense may transfer under the authority of this section in any fiscal year is $200,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Transfers under this subsection may only be made from amounts appropriated to the Department of Defense for any fiscal year that remain available for obligation, other than amounts within any operation and maintenance appropriation that are available for (A) an account (known as a budget activity 1 account) that is specified as being for operating forces, or (B) an account (known as a budget activity 2 account) that is specified as being for mobilization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The authority provided by this subsection is in addition to any other authority provided by law authorizing the transfer of amounts available to the Department of Defense. However, the Secretary may not use any such authority under another provision of law for a purpose described in paragraph (1) if there is authority available under this subsection for that purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The authority provided by this subsection to transfer amounts may not be used to provide authority for an activity that has been denied authorization by Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) A transfer made from one account to another under the authority of this subsection shall be deemed to increase the amount authorized for the account to which the amount is transferred by an amount equal to the amount transferred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Report Upon Designation of an Operation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Within 45 days after the Secretary of Defense identifies an operation pursuant to subsection (a)(2), the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report that sets forth the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The manner by which the Secretary proposes to obtain funds for the cost to the United States of the operation, including a specific discussion of how the Secretary proposes to restore balances in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Defense Business Operations Fund (or a successor fund), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the accounts from which the Secretary transfers funds under the authority of subsection (c), to the levels that would have been anticipated but for the provisions of subsection (c).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If the operation is described in subsection (a)(1)(B), a justification why the budgetary resources of another department or agency of the Federal Government, instead of resources of the Department of Defense, are not being used for carrying out the operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The objectives of the operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The estimated duration of the operation and of any deployment of armed forces personnel in such operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The estimated incremental cost of the operation to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The exit criteria for the operation and for the withdrawal of the elements of the armed forces involved in the operation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may not restore balances in the Defense Business Operations Fund through increases in rates charged by that fund in order to compensate for costs incurred and not reimbursed due to subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not restore balances in the Defense Business Operations Fund or any other fund or account through the use of unobli<!-- PDFPage:79 -->gated amounts in an operation and maintenance appropriation that are available within that appropriation for (A) an account (known as a budget activity 1 account) that is specified as being for operating forces, or (B) an account (known as a budget activity 2 account) that is specified as being for mobilization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Submission of Requests for Supplemental Appropriations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that whenever there is an operation described in subsection (a), the President should, not later than 90 days after the date on which notification is provided pursuant to subsection (a)(3), submit to Congress a request for the enactment of supplemental appropriations for the then-current fiscal year in order to provide funds to replenish the Defense Business Operations Fund or any other fund or account of the Department of Defense from which funds for the incremental expenses of that operation were derived under this section and should, as necessary, submit subsequent requests for the enactment of such appropriations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Incremental Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this section, incremental costs of the Department of Defense with respect to an operation are the costs of the Department that are directly attributable to the operation (and would not have been incurred but for the operation). Incremental costs do not include the cost of property or services acquired by the Department that are paid for by a source outside the Department or out of funds contributed by such a source.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Relationship to War Powers Resolution</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section may not be construed as altering or superseding the War Powers Resolution. This section does not provide authority to conduct any military operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>GAO Compliance Reviews</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Comptroller General of the United States shall from time to time, and when requested by a committee of Congress, conduct a review of the defense funding structure under this section to determine whether the Department of Defense is complying with the requirements and limitations of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may prescribe regulations or issue orders under paragraph (1) to prohibit the dissemination of any information described in such paragraph only if and to the extent that the Secretary determines that the unauthorized dissemination of such information could reasonably be expected to have a significant adverse effect on the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security by significantly increasing the likelihood of&mdash;</p>

The Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the military departments may not be required to make a reduction in the number of full-time equivalent positions in the Department of Defense unless such reduction is necessary due to a reduction in funds available to the Department or is required under a law that is enacted after February 10, 1996, and that refers specifically to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The number of, and the amount of funds available to be paid to, indirectly funded Government employees of the Department of Defense may not be&mdash;</p>

With respect to the MRTFB structure, the term &ldquo;funds made available&rdquo; includes both direct appropriated funds and funds provided by MRTFB customers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Not later than February 1 of each year, the Secretary of each military department and the head of each Defense Agency shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives a report on the management of the civilian workforce under the jurisdiction of that official.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each report of an official under paragraph (1) shall contain the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The official's certification (i) that the civilian workforce under the jurisdiction of the official is not subject to any constraint or limitation in terms of man years, end strength, full-time equivalent positions, or maximum number of employees, and (ii) that, during the 12 months preceding the date on which the report is due, such workforce has not been subject to any such constraint or limitation.</p>
