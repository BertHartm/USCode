<h4 class="italic-text-head">&sect;123. Authority to suspend officer personnel laws during war or national emergency  </h4>
<p class="italic-text-para">(a) In time of war, or of national emergency declared by Congress or the President after November 30, 1980, the President may suspend the operation of any provision of law relating to the promotion, involuntary retirement, or separation of commissioned officers of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard Reserve.

<p class="italic-text-para">(b) Any such suspension shall, if not sooner ended, end on the last day of the two-year period beginning on the date on which the suspension (or the last extension thereof) takes effect or on the last day of the one-year period beginning on the date of the termination of the war or national emergency, whichever occurs first. With respect to the end of any such suspension, the preceding sentence supersedes the provisions of title II of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1621&ndash;1622) which provide that powers or authorities exercised by reason of a national emergency shall cease to be exercised after the date of the termination of the emergency.  </p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Designation of National Contingency Operations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The funding procedures prescribed by this section apply with respect to any operation involving the armed forces that is designated by the Secretary of Defense as a National Contingency Operation. Whenever the Secretary designates an operation as a National Contingency Operation, the Secretary shall promptly transmit notice of that designation in writing to Congress. This section does not provide authority for the President or the Secretary of Defense to carry out an operation, but applies to the Department of Defense mechanisms by which funds are provided for operations that the armed forces are required to carry out under some other authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Waiver of Requirement To Reimburse Support Units</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) When an operating unit of the armed forces participating in a National Contingency Operation receives support services from a support unit of the armed forces that operates through the Defense Business Operations Fund (or a successor fund), that operating unit need not reimburse that support unit for the incremental costs incurred by the support unit in providing such support, notwithstanding any other provision of law or Government accounting practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amounts which but for paragraph (1) would be required to be reimbursed to a support unit shall be recorded as an expense attributable to the operation and shall be accounted for separately.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The total of the unreimbursed sums for all National Contingency Operations may not exceed $300,000,000 at any one time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Financial Plan for Contingency Operations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Within two months of the beginning of any National Contingency Operation, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a financial plan for the operation that sets forth the manner by which the Secretary proposes to obtain funds for the full cost to the United States of the operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The plan shall specify in detail how the Secretary proposes to make the Defense Business Operations Fund (or a successor fund) whole again.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Incremental Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this section, incremental costs of the Department of Defense with respect to an operation are the costs that are directly attributable to the operation and that are otherwise chargeable to accounts available for operation and maintenance or for military personnel. Any costs which are otherwise chargeable to accounts available for procurement may not be considered to be incremental costs for purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Incremental Personnel Costs Account</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There is hereby established in the Department of Defense a reserve fund to be known as the &ldquo;National Contingency Operation Personnel Fund&rdquo;. Amounts in the fund shall be available for incremental military personnel costs attributable to a National Contingency Operation. Amounts in the fund remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Coordination With War Powers Resolution</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section may not be construed as altering or superseding the War Powers Resolution. This section does not provide authority to conduct a National Contingency Operation or any other operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>GAO Compliance Reviews</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Comptroller General of the United States shall from time to time, and when requested by a committee of Congress, conduct a review of the defense contingency funding structure under this section to determine whether the Department of Defense is complying with the requirements and limitations of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;National Contingency Operation&rdquo; means a military operation that is designated by the Secretary of Defense as an operation the cost of which, when considered with the cost of other ongoing or potential military operations, is expected to have a negative effect on training and readiness.</p>
