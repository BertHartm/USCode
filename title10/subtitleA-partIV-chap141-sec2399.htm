<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Condition for Proceeding Beyond Low-Rate Initial Production</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of <!-- PDFPage:1007 -->Defense shall provide that a major defense acquisition program may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production until initial operational test and evaluation of the program is completed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In this subsection, the term &ldquo;major defense acquisition program&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a conventional weapons system that is a major system within the meaning of that term in section 2302(5) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is designed for use in combat.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Operational Test and Evaluation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Operational testing of a major defense acquisition program may not be conducted until the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation of the Department of Defense approves (in writing) the adequacy of the plans (including the projected level of funding) for operational test and evaluation to be conducted in connection with that program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Director shall analyze the results of the operational test and evaluation conducted for each major defense acquisition program. At the conclusion of such testing, the Director shall prepare a report stating the opinion of the Director as to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) whether the test and evaluation performed were adequate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) whether the results of such test and evaluation confirm that the items or components actually tested are effective and suitable for combat.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Director shall submit each report under paragraph (2) to the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, and the congressional defense committees. Each such report shall be submitted to those committees in precisely the same form and with precisely the same content as the report originally was submitted to the Secretary and Under Secretary and shall be accompanied by such comments as the Secretary may wish to make on the report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A final decision within the Department of Defense to proceed with a major defense acquisition program beyond low-rate initial production may not be made until the Director has submitted to the Secretary of Defense the report with respect to that program under paragraph (2) and the congressional defense committees have received that report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In this subsection, the term &ldquo;major defense acquisition program&rdquo; has the meaning given that term in section 139(a)(2)(B) of this title.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Impartiality of Contractor Testing Personnel</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of a major defense acquisition program (as defined in subsection (a)(2)), no person employed by the contractor for the system being tested may be involved in the conduct of the operational test and evaluation required under subsection (a).

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Director may waive the limitation under paragraph (1) in any case if the Director determines in writing that sufficient steps have been taken to ensure the impartiality of the contractor in providing the services. The Inspector General of the Department of Defense shall review each such waiver and shall include in the Inspector General's semi-annual report an assessment of those waivers made since the last such report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) A contractor that has participated in (or is participating in) the development, production, or testing of a system for a military department or Defense Agency (or for another contractor of the Department of Defense) may not be involved (in any way) in the establishment of criteria for data collection, performance assessment, or evaluation activities for the operational test and evaluation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The limitation in subparagraph (A) does not apply to a contractor that has participated in such development, production, or testing solely in testing for the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Source of Funds for Testing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The costs for all tests required under subsection (a) shall be paid from funds available for the system being tested.</p>
