<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Recommendations to Secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a board of inquiry determines that the officer has failed to establish that the officer should be retained in an active status, the board shall recommend to the Secretary concerned that the officer not be retained in an active status.</p>
