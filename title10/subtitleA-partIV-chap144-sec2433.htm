<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If the program manager of a major defense acquisition program for which a unit cost report has previously been submitted under subsection (b) determines at any time during a quarter that there is reasonable cause to believe that the program acquisition unit cost for the program (or for a designated major subprogram under the program) or the procurement unit cost for the program (or for such a subprogram), as applicable, has increased by a percentage equal to or greater than the significant cost growth threshold; and if a unit cost report indicating an increase of such percentage or more has not previously been submitted to the service acquisition executive designated by the Secretary concerned, then the program manager shall immediately submit to such service acquisition executive a unit cost report containing the information, determined as of the date of the report, required under subsection (b).</p>

In the case of a determination based on a quarterly report submitted in accordance with subsection (b), the Secretary shall submit the notification to Congress within 45 days after the end of the quarter. In the case of a determination based on a report submitted in accordance with subsection (c), the Secretary shall submit the notification to Congress within 45 days after the date of that report. The Secretary shall include in the notification the date on which the determination was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), whenever the Secretary concerned determines under subsection (d) that the program acquisition unit cost or the procurement unit cost of a major defense acquisition program or designated major subprogram has increased by a percentage equal to or greater than the significant cost growth threshold for the program or subprogram, a Selected Acquisition Report shall be submitted to Congress for the first fiscal-year quarter ending on or after the date of the determination or for the fiscal-year quarter which immediately precedes the first fiscal-year quarter ending on or after that date.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the program acquisition unit cost or procurement unit cost of a major defense acquisition program or designated major subprogram (as determined by the Secretary under subsection (d)) increases by a percentage equal to or greater than the critical cost growth threshold for the program or subprogram, the Secretary of Defense shall take actions consistent with the requirements of section 2433a of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a determination of an increase by a percentage equal to or greater than the significant cost growth threshold is made by the Secretary under subsection (d) and a Selected Acquisition Report containing the information described in subsection (g) is not submitted to Congress under paragraph (1), or if a determination of an increase by a percentage equal to or greater than the critical cost growth threshold is made by the Secretary under subsection (d) and the certification of the Secretary of Defense is not submitted to Congress under paragraph (2), funds appropriated for military construction, for research, development, test, and evaluation, and for procurement may not be obligated for a major contract under the program. The prohibition on the obligation of funds for a major defense acquisition program shall cease to apply at the end of a period of 30 days of continuous session of Congress (as determined under section 7307(b)(2) of this title) beginning on the date&mdash;</p>
