<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The President may award a distinguished flying cross of appropriate design with accompanying ribbon to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the Army, distinguishes himself by heroism or extraordinary achievement while participating in an aerial flight.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Not more than one distinguished flying cross may be awarded to a person. However, for each succeeding act that would otherwise justify the award of such a cross, the President may award a suitable bar or other device to be worn as he directs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) No distinguished flying cross, or device in place thereof, may be awarded or presented to a person whose service after he distinguished himself has not been honorable.</p>

<p class="note-body">Although 10:1429 refers to persons serving &ldquo;with the Air Corps of the Army&rdquo;, and the functions of the Army Air Corps have been transferred to the Air Force under section 208(b) of the National Security Act of 1947 (5 U.S.C. 626c(b)), members of the Army continue to participate in aerial flights and are eligible for the award of the distinguished flying cross.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;Under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe&rdquo; are omitted, since the President has inherent authority to issue regulations appropriate to exercising his functions. The words &ldquo;but not in the name of Congress&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage, since a medal is presented in the name of Congress only if the law so directs. The word &ldquo;award&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;present&rdquo; to cover the determination of the recipients as well as the actual presentation of the medal. The words &ldquo;since the 6th day of April, 1917, has distinguished, or who, after July 2, 1926&rdquo; and 10:1429 (proviso of 1st sentence) are omitted as executed.</p>
