<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The position of Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence was established in 2002 by Public Law 107&ndash;314 [see 10 U.S.C. 137] in order to facilitate resolution of the challenges to achieving an integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance structure <!-- PDFPage:235 -->in the Department of Defense to meet such 21st century requirements.</p>
