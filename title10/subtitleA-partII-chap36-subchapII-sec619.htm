<p class="statutory-body">(3) When the needs of the service require, the Secretary of the military department concerned may prescribe a longer period of service in grade for eligibility for promotion, in the case of officers to whom paragraph (1) applies, or for eligibility for consideration for promotion, in the case of officers to whom paragraph (2) applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of the military department concerned may waive paragraph (2) to the extent necessary to assure that officers described in subparagraph (A) of such paragraph have at least two opportunities for consideration for promotion to the next higher grade as officers below the promotion zone.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In computing service in grade for purposes of this section, service in a grade held as a result of assignment to a position is counted as service in the grade in which the officer would have served except for such assignment or appointment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Continued Eligibility for Consideration for Promotion of Officers Who Have Previously Failed of Selection</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), an officer who has failed of selection for promotion to the next higher grade remains eligible for consideration for promotion to that grade as long as he continues on active duty in other than a retired status and is not promoted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to a regular officer who is ineligible for consideration for promotion under section 631(c) of this title or to a reserve officer who has failed of selection for promotion to the grade of captain or, in the case of an officer of the Navy, lieutenant for the second time.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may, by regulation, prescribe a period of time, not to exceed one year, from the time an officer is placed on the active-duty list during which the officer shall be ineligible for consideration for promotion; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) may, by regulation, preclude from consideration by a selection board by which he would otherwise be eligible to be considered, an officer who has an established separation date that is within 90 days after the date the board is convened.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary of Defense may authorize the Secretaries of the military departments to preclude from consideration by selection boards for promotion to the grade of brigadier general or rear admiral (lower half) officers in the grade of colonel or, in the case of the Navy, captain who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) have been considered and not selected for promotion to the grade of brigadier general or rear admiral (lower half) by at least two selection boards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) are determined, in accordance with standards and procedures prescribed pursuant to subparagraph (B), as not being exceptionally well qualified for promotion.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Secretary of Defense authorizes the Secretaries of the military departments to have the authority described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall prescribe by regulation the standards and procedures for the exercise of such authority. Those regulations shall apply uniformly among the military departments and shall include the following provisions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) A requirement that the Secretary of a military department may exercise such authority in the case of a particular selection board only if the Secretary of Defense approves the exercise of that authority for that board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) A requirement that an officer may be precluded from consideration by a selection board under this paragraph only upon the recommendation of a preselection board of officers convened by the Secretary of the military department concerned and composed of at least three officers all of whom are serving in a grade higher than the grade of such officer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) A requirement that such a preselection board may not recommend that an officer be precluded from such consideration unless the Secretary concerned has given the officer advance written notice of the convening of such board and of the military records that will be considered by the board and has given the officer a reasonable period before the convening of the board in which to submit comments to the board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) A requirement that the Secretary convening such a preselection board shall provide general guidance to the board in accordance with standards and procedures prescribed by the Secretary of Defense in those regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) A requirement that the preselection board may recommend that an officer be precluded from consideration by a selection board only on the basis of the general guidance provided by the Secretary of the military department concerned, information in the officer's official military personnel records that has been described in the notice provided the officer as required pursuant to clause (iii), and any communication to the board received from that officer before the board convenes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
