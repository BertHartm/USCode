<p class="statutory-body">(a) The assignment of naval vessel conversion, alteration, and repair projects shall be based on economic and military considerations and may not be restricted by a requirement that certain parts of naval shipwork be assigned to a particular type of shipyard or geographical area or by a similar requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In evaluating bids or proposals for a contract for the overhaul, repair, or maintenance of a naval vessel, the Secretary of the Navy shall, in determining the cost or price of work to be performed in an area outside the area of the homeport of the vessel, consider foreseeable costs of moving the vessel and its crew from the homeport to the outside area and from the outside area back to the homeport at the completion of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Before issuing a solicitation for a contract for short-term work for the overhaul, repair, or maintenance of a naval vessel, the Secretary of the Navy shall determine if there is adequate competition available among firms able to perform the work at the homeport of the vessel. If the Secretary determines that there is adequate competition among such firms, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall issue such a solicitation only to firms able to perform the work at the homeport of the vessel; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may not award such contract to a firm other than a firm that will perform the work at the homeport of the vessel.</p>
