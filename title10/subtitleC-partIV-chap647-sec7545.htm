<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words, &ldquo;ordnance material&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;ordnance, guns, projectiles&rdquo;. Posts of the Grand Army of the Republic are omitted from the list of authorized donees because there are no surviving members of that organization. The word &ldquo;Commonwealth&rdquo; is inserted to reflect the present status of Puerto Rico. Specific reference to the Canal Zone is omitted as unnecessary, since the Zone is a &ldquo;possession of the United States&rdquo; as defined in section 101 of this title and is therefore covered by clause (1).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (d) is added to note the existence of a later act, codified in &sect;2572 of this title, which provides similar disposal authority, and to give effect to &sect;2 of the Act of February 27, 1948, ch. 76, 62 Stat. 37, which is not now contained in the U.S. Code, and which saves this section despite the apparent implied repeal.</p>
