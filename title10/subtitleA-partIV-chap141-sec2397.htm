<p class="note-body">In the section, the words &ldquo;services, supplies, or both&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;services and materials&rdquo; because &ldquo;supplies&rdquo; is defined in 10:101(26) to include material. However, the word &ldquo;construction&rdquo; is retained and used with &ldquo;services, supplies, or both&rdquo; to allow the definition of &ldquo;services and materials&rdquo; in 50:1436(a)(4) to be omitted. The text of 50:1436(b) (words before (1)) is omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the definition of &ldquo;Department of Defense&rdquo; in 50:1436(a)(5) is omitted because of 10:101(5). The text of 50:1436(h) is omitted as executed. The text of 50:1436(a)(7) is omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2), the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;individual, firm, corporation, partnership, association, or other legal entity&rdquo; because of 1:1.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(3), the source provisions are restated to include the conduct described therein within the definition of &ldquo;served&rdquo; when used with &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo;. Although 50:1436(b)(1)(A)&ndash;(C) appear to be co-equal clauses, the use in other parts of the source provision only of the language used in clause (A), coupled with the legislative history of the source provision, indicates that clauses (B) and (C) are only descriptions of conduct that is within the scope of clause (A) as service &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; than that described in that clause.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the word &ldquo;commissioned&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary because of 10:101(14). The words &ldquo;Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Armed Forces of the United States&rdquo; for clarity. In ordinary context, &ldquo;Armed Forces of the United States&rdquo; would include the Coast Guard (10:101(4)). However, the context of 50:1436 indicates that the term was not intended to include the Coast Guard; the section elsewhere refers only to the Department of Defense, not to the Department of Transportation under which the Coast Guard is located. The words &ldquo;civilian official&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;civilian officer&rdquo; to use the more appropriate terminology.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the text of 50:1436(e) (less words before semicolon) is omitted as covered by the words &ldquo;holds .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at any time during a fiscal year&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the word &ldquo;Congress&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives&rdquo; for consistency in title 10 and with other titles of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f), the words &ldquo;shall be guilty of a misdemeanor&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of 18:1. The words &ldquo;upon conviction thereof&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
