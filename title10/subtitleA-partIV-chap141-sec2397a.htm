<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the person may not accept or continue employment with the defense contractor during the 10-year period beginning with the date of separation from Government service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the Secretary may impose on the person an administrative penalty in the amount of $10,000, or in such lesser amount as may be prescribed by the Secretary, taking into consideration all the circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An individual who accepts or continues employment prohibited by subparagraph (A)(i) shall be liable to the United States for an administrative penalty as provided in subparagraph (A)(ii).

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">There shall be a rebuttable presumption in favor of a covered defense official that failure to report a contact with a defense contractor or failure to disqualify himself from participation in the performance of certain procurement functions is not a violation of subsection (b)(1)(A) or (b)(2) or subsection (b)(1)(B), as the case may be, if the defense official has received an opinion in writing from the designated agency ethics official under subsection (e) stating that a report or disqualification by the official was not necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Determinations of the Secretary under subparagraph (A) shall be made on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing as provided in subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5. The determinations of the Secretary shall be subject to judicial review under chapter 7 of such title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If a designated agency ethics official or his designee receives a report required by subsection (b) or a request for advice from a covered defense official relating to a contact described in such subsection, the designated agency ethics official or his designee may issue a written opinion regarding the necessity of a covered defense official to file a report or disqualify himself from participation in certain procurement functions, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) A covered defense official should request the advice of his supervisor and the appropriate designated agency ethics official (or his designee) on matters to which this section applies.</p>
