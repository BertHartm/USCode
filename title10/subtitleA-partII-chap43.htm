<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the word &ldquo;Regular&rdquo;, pertaining to major generals and brigadier generals, in 10:517 and 34:241a, is omitted, since the last sentence of 10:517 and 34:241a establish the rank of nonregular officers of the Army and the Air Force, with respect to officers of the Regular Army and the Regular Air Force. The effect of establishing their rank with respect to regular officers, when read in connection with the provisions prescribing the rank of officers of the regular components with officers of the other services, under 10:517 (less last sentence), 34:241a (less last sentence), and 34:241, is therefore to establish the rank of nonregular officers with respect to officers of the other listed services. This allows a consolidation of 10:517 (less last sentence, as applicable to rank), 34:241, and 34:241a (less last sentence, as applicable to rank), together with 34:651, into a table of rank among officers of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. The words &ldquo;lineal rank only being considered&rdquo;, in 34:241, are covered by setting forth the grades in tabular form. The words &ldquo;whether on the active or retired list&rdquo;, in 34:241, are omitted, since retired officers of the Navy continue to be officers of the Navy. The words &ldquo;Lieutenant (junior grade)&rdquo; are substituted for the word &ldquo;masters&rdquo;, in R.S. 1466, to reflect the change made in the name of that grade by the Act of March 3, 1883, ch. 97 (2d par.), 22 Stat. 472.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (a) and (b), the words &ldquo;entitled to pay&rdquo; and &ldquo;entitled to the pay&rdquo;, respectively, are inserted, since rear admiral is one grade with two ranks depending on the amount of pay to which the incumbent is entitled.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;in such grades&rdquo;, in 10:517 and 34:241a, are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;A commissioned officer of the Army or the Air Force&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;All officers of the Army of the United States, including all components thereof&rdquo;, since rank among officers of the Regular Army and Regular Air Force is determined under sections 3573, 3574, 8573, and 8574 of this title.</p>

The exception as to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is included because of section 142(c) of this title. The words &ldquo;and the Marine Corps&rdquo; are inserted, since under section 5081 of this title the Chief of Naval Operations takes precedence over all other officers of the naval service.</p>
