<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Sense of Congress Regarding Required Reductions and Other Changes in National Defense Outlays in Relation to Budget Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that the outlay level specified for national defense for any fiscal year in the budget resolution for that fiscal year should not require a reduction (or other change) in outlays for national defense for that fiscal year below (or in relation to) the estimated outlays specified for national defense in the budget for such fiscal year (submitted to Congress pursuant to section 1105 of title 31, United States Code) by more than the amount by which such estimated outlays would be reduced (or otherwise changed) if the amount of budget authority provided for in each title of the President's request for budget authority for national defense (as contained in such budget) were reduced (or otherwise changed) by the uniform percentage necessary for the requested budget authority for national defense to be equal to the budget authority specified for national defense in that budget resolution unless the budget resolution is accompanied by a report that describes the difference between the budget authority and outlays for National Defense (function 050) in the President's budget and the budget resolution.&rdquo;</p>
