<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary of Defense shall submit a report to the appropriate committees of Congress each year with respect to military construction activities and military family housing activities. Each such report shall be submitted at the same time that the annual request for military construction authorization is submitted for that year.

<!-- PDFPage:1267 --><p class="statutory-body">(b) Each report under subsection (a) shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A statement of the construction status and a fiscal summary of the military construction projects undertaken under, and the amounts authorized and appropriated for, contingency construction under section 2804 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Information to enable the committees to evaluate the relationships between budget requests for appropriations for unspecified minor construction projects under section 2805 of this title and obligations of appropriated funds for projects under such section. Such information shall include comparisons of budget requests and obligations using military construction appropriations and using operations and maintenance appropriations, maintenance and repair backlog, and obligations for maintenance and repair.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Information to enable the committees to monitor trends in construction started using funds contributed by the United States under section 2806 of this title to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Security Investment program and the status of recoupments under that program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Information to enable the committees to evaluate trends in contracting for architect and engineering services and construction design, and trends in accomplishing design of construction projects by Government employees, under the authority of section 2807 of this title.</p>

There shall also be included an analysis to indicate whether the cost variation was the result of a lack of competition, quality of plans and specifications, or quality of budget estimates, or of other factors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Information to enable the committees to evaluate the use of the authority provided under section 2858 of this title to expedite a military construction project when such expediting is required to protect the national interest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) With respect to each contract awarded during the preceding fiscal year on other than a competitive basis to the lowest responsible bidder, the name of the contractor, the original amount of the contract, and the reason for the award of the contract on other than a competitive basis.</p>
