<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not later than December 15 of each year, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology shall submit to the Secretary a report that lists each acquisition position that is restricted to members of the armed forces under such policy and the recommendation of the Under Secretary as to whether such position should remain so restricted.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Assignments Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a policy on assigning military personnel to acquisition positions that provides for a balance between (A) the need for personnel to serve in career broadening positions, and (B) the need for requiring service in each such position for sufficient time to provide the stability necessary to effectively carry out the duties of the position and to allow for the establishment of responsibility and accountability for actions taken in the position.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In implementing the policy established under paragraph (1), the Secretaries of the military departments shall provide, as appropriate, for longer lengths of assignments to acquisition positions than assignments to other positions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Performance Appraisals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of each military department, acting through the service acquisition executive for that department, shall provide an opportunity for review and inclusion of any comments on any appraisal of the performance of a person serving in an acquisition position by a person serving in an acquisition position in the same acquisition career field.</p>

Except as provided in subsection (d), the Secretary concerned may not reassign a person from such an assignment before the end of the three-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person may not be assigned to a critical acquisition position unless the person executes a written agreement to remain on active duty (in the case of a member of the armed forces) or to remain in Federal service (in the case of an employee) in that position for at least three years. The service obligation contained in such a written agreement shall remain in effect unless and until waived by the Secretary concerned under subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The assignment period requirement of the first sentence of paragraph (1) is waived for any individual serving as a deputy program manager if the individual is assigned to a critical acquisition position upon completion of the individual's assignment as a deputy program manager.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The regulations shall require that major milestones be clearly definable and measurable events that mark the completion of a significant phase in a major defense acquisition program <!-- PDFPage:575 -->and that such milestones be the same as the milestones contained in the baseline description established for the program pursuant to section 2435(a) of this title. The Secretary shall require that the major milestones as defined in the regulations be included in the Selected Acquisition Report required for such program under section 2432 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The authority to grant such waivers may be delegated by the service acquisition executive of a military department only to the Director of Acquisition Career Management for the military department.</p>

Such rotation policy shall be designed to ensure opportunities for career broadening assignments and an infusion of new ideas into critical acquisition positions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a procedure under which the assignment of each person assigned to a critical acquisition position shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, by the acquisition career program board of the department concerned, for the purpose of determining whether the Government and such person would be better served by a reassignment to a different position. Such a review shall be carried out with respect to each such person not later than five years after that person is assigned to a critical position. Reviews under this subsection shall be carried out after October 1, 1995, but may be carried out before that date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Centralized Job Referral System</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations providing for the use of centralized lists to ensure that persons are selected for critical positions without regard to geographic location of applicants for such positions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Exchange Program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall establish, for purposes of broadening the experience of members of each Acquisition Corps, a test program in which members of a Corps serving in a military department or Defense Agency are assigned or detailed to an acquisition position in another department or agency. Under the test program, the Secretary of Defense shall ensure that, to the maximum extent practicable, at least 5 percent of the members of the Acquisition Corps shall serve in such exchange assignments each year. The test program shall operate for not less than a period of three years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall submit the portion of the test program applicable to civilian employees to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management for approval.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this subchapter:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;program manager&rdquo; means, with respect to a defense acquisition program, the member of an Acquisition Corps responsible for managing the program, regardless of the title given the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;deputy program manager&rdquo; means the person who has authority to act on behalf of the program manager in the absence of the program manager.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;significant nonmajor defense acquisition program&rdquo; means a Department of Defense acquisition program that is not a major defense acquisition program (as defined in section 2430 of this title) and that is estimated by the Secretary of Defense to require an eventual total expenditure for research, development, test, and evaluation of more than the dollar threshold set forth in section 2302(5)(A) of this title for such purposes for a major system or an eventual total expenditure for procurement of more than the dollar threshold set forth in section 2302(5)(A) of this title for such purpose for a major system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The term &ldquo;program executive officer&rdquo; has the meaning given such term in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The term &ldquo;senior contracting official&rdquo; means a director of contracting, or a principal deputy to a director of contracting, serving in the office of the Secretary of a military de<!-- PDFPage:577 -->partment, the headquarters of a military department, the head of a Defense Agency, a subordinate command headquarters, or in a major systems or logistics contracting activity in the Department of Defense.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Waiver</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of each military department (acting through the service acquisition executive for that department) or the Secretary of Defense (acting through the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology) for Defense Agencies and other components of the Department of Defense may waive, on a case-by-case basis, the requirements established under this subchapter with respect to the assignment of an individual to a particular critical acquisition position. Such a waiver may be granted only if unusual circumstances justify the waiver or if the Secretary concerned (or official to whom the waiver authority is delegated) determines that the individual's qualifications obviate the need for meeting the education, training, and experience requirements established under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The authority to grant such waivers may be delegated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of the service acquisition executives of the military departments, only to the Director of Acquisition Career Management for the military department concerned; and</p>
