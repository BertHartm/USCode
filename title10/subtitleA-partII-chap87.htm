<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Limitation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any civilian or military member of the Corps who does not meet the education, training, and experience requirements for a critical acquisition position established under this subchapter may not carry out the duties or exercise the authorities of that position, except for a period not to exceed six months, unless a waiver of the requirements is granted under subsection (c).</p>
