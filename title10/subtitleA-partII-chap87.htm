Except as provided in subsection (d), the Secretary concerned may not reassign a person from such an assignment before the end of the three-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person may not be assigned to a critical acquisition position unless the person executes a written agreement to remain on active duty (in the case of a member of the armed forces) or to remain in Federal service (in the case of an employee) in that position for at least three years. The service obligation contained in such a written agreement shall remain in effect unless and until waived by the Secretary concerned under subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The assignment period requirement of the first sentence of paragraph (1) is waived for any individual serving as a deputy program manager if the individual is assigned to a critical acquisition position upon completion of the individual's assignment as a deputy program manager.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a requirement that, to the maximum extent practicable, a program manager who is the replacement for a reassigned program manager arrive at the assignment location before the reassigned program manager leaves.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Except as provided in subsection (d), the Secretary concerned may not reassign a program manager or deputy program manager from such an assignment until after such major milestone has occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person may not be assigned to a critical acquisition position as a program manager or deputy program manager of a major defense acquisition program unless the person executes a written agreement to remain on active duty (in the case of a member of the armed forces) or to remain in Federal service (in the case of an employee) in that position at least until completion of the first major milestone that occurs closest in time to the date on which the person has served in the position for four years. The service obligation contained in such a written agreement shall remain in effect unless and until waived by the Secretary concerned under subsection (d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The assignment period requirement under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) is waived for any individual serving as a deputy program manager if the individual is assigned to a critical acquisition position upon completion of the individual's assignment as a deputy program manager.</p>

The service acquisition executive of each military department shall establish major milestones at the beginning of a major defense acquisition program consistent with such regulations and shall use such milestones to determine the assignment period for program managers and deputy program managers under subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The regulations shall require that major milestones be clearly definable and measurable events that mark the completion of a significant phase in a major defense acquisition program and that such milestones be the same as the milestones contained in the baseline description established for the program pursuant to section 2435(a) of this title. The Secretary shall require that the major milestones as defined in the regulations be included in the Selected Acquisition Report required for such program under section 2432 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to each waiver granted under this subsection, the service acquisition executive (or his delegate) shall set forth in a written document the rationale for the decision to grant the waiver.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Rotation Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a policy encouraging the rotation of members of the Acquisition Corps <!-- PDFPage:806 -->serving in critical acquisition positions to new assignments after completion of five years of service in such positions, or, in the case of a program manager, after completion of a major program milestone, whichever is longer. Such rotation policy shall be designed to ensure opportunities for career broadening assignments and an infusion of new ideas into critical acquisition positions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a procedure under which the assignment of each person assigned to a critical acquisition position shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis for the purpose of determining whether the Government and such person would be better served by a reassignment to a different position. Such a review shall be carried out with respect to each such person not later than five years after that person is assigned to a critical position.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Centralized Job Referral System</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations providing for the use of centralized lists to ensure that persons are selected for critical positions without regard to geographic location of applicants for such positions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Exchange Program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall establish, for purposes of broadening the experience of members of the Acquisition Corps, a test program in which members of the Corps serving in a military department or Defense Agency are assigned or detailed to an acquisition position in another department or agency.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this subchapter:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;significant nonmajor defense acquisition program&rdquo; means a Department of Defense acquisition program that is not a major defense acquisition program (as defined in section 2430 of this title) and that is estimated by the Secretary of Defense to require an eventual total expenditure for research, development, test, and evaluation of more than the dollar threshold set forth in section 2302(5)(A) of this title for such purposes for a major system or an eventual total expenditure for procurement of more than the dollar threshold set forth in section 2302(5)(A) of this title for such purpose for a major system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The term &ldquo;program executive officer&rdquo; has the meaning given such term in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The term &ldquo;senior contracting official&rdquo; means a director of contracting, or a principal deputy to a director of contracting, serving in the office of the Secretary of a military department, the headquarters of a military department, the head of a Defense Agency, a subordinate command headquarters, or in a major systems or logistics contracting activity in the Department of Defense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Limitation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any civilian or military member of the Corps who does not meet the education, training, and experience requirements for a critical acquisition position established under this subchapter may not carry out the duties or exercise the authorities of that position, except for a period not to exceed six months, unless a waiver of the requirements is granted under subsection (c).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:808 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Waiver</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of each military department (acting through the service acquisition executive for that department) or the Secretary of Defense (acting through the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) for Defense Agencies and other components of the Department of Defense may waive, on a case-by-case basis, the requirements established under this subchapter with respect to the assignment of an individual to a particular critical acquisition position. Such a waiver may be granted only if unusual circumstances justify the waiver or if the Secretary concerned (or official to whom the waiver authority is delegated) determines that the individual's qualifications obviate the need for meeting the education, training, and experience requirements established under this subchapter.</p>
