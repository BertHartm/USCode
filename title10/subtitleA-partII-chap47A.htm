<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Authority for Military Commissions Under This Chapter</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The President is authorized to establish military commissions under this chapter for offenses triable by military commission as provided in this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Construction of Provisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The procedures for military commissions set forth in this chapter are based upon the procedures for trial by general courts-martial under chapter 47 of this title (the Uniform Code of Military Justice). Chapter 47 of this title does not, by its terms, apply to trial by military commission except as specifically provided therein or in this chapter, and many of the provisions of chapter 47 of this title are by their terms inapplicable to military commissions. The judicial construction and application of chapter 47 of this title, while instructive, is therefore not of its own force binding on military commissions established under this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Section 832 (article 32 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), relating to pretrial investigation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Other provisions of chapter 47 of this title shall apply to trial by military commission under this chapter only to the extent provided by the terms of such provisions or by this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Geneva Conventions Not Establishing Private Right of Action</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No alien unprivileged enemy belligerent subject to trial by military commission under this chapter may invoke the Geneva Conventions as a basis for a private right of action.</p>

Such procedures may not be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or chapter 47 of this title, the procedures and rules of evidence applicable in trials by general courts-martial of the United States shall apply in trials by military commission under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Exceptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In trials by military commission under this chapter, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Attorney General, may make such exceptions in the applicability of the procedures and rules of evidence otherwise applicable in general courts-martial as may be required by the unique circumstances of the conduct of military and intelligence operations during hostilities or by other practical need consistent with this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any exceptions authorized by paragraph (1), the procedures and rules of evidence in trials by military commission under this chapter shall include, at a minimum, the following rights of the accused:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) To present evidence in the accused's defense, to cross-examine the witnesses who testify against the accused, and to examine and respond to all evidence admitted against the accused on the issue of guilt or innocence and for sentencing, as provided for by this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) When none of the charges sworn against the accused are capital, to be represented before a military commission by civilian counsel if provided at no expense to the Government, and by either the defense counsel detailed or the military counsel of the accused's own selection, if reasonably available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) When any of the charges sworn against the accused are capital, to be represented before a military commission in accordance with clause (i) and, to the greatest extent practicable, by at least one additional counsel who is learned in applicable law relating to capital cases and who, if necessary, may be a civilian and compensated in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) To self-representation, if the accused knowingly and competently waives the assistance of counsel, subject to the provisions of paragraph (4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) To the suppression of evidence that is not reliable or probative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) To the suppression of evidence the probative value of which is substantially outweighed by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the members; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In making exceptions in the applicability in trials by military commission under this chapter from the procedures and rules otherwise applicable in general courts-martial, the Secretary of Defense may provide the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Evidence seized outside the United States shall not be excluded from trial by military commission on the grounds that the evidence was not seized pursuant to a search warrant or authorization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A statement of the accused that is otherwise admissible shall not be excluded from trial by military commission on grounds of alleged coercion or compulsory self-incrimination so long as the evidence complies with the provisions of section 948r of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Evidence shall be admitted as authentic so long as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the military judge of the military commission determines that there is sufficient evidence that the evidence is what it is claimed to be; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the military judge instructs the members that they may consider any issue as to authentication or identification of evidence in determining the weight, if any, to be given to the evidence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Hearsay evidence not otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence applicable in trial by general courts-martial may be admitted in a trial by military commission only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the proponent of the evidence makes known to the adverse party, sufficiently in advance to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to meet the evidence, the proponent's intention to offer the evidence, and the particulars of the evidence (including information on the circumstances under which the evidence was obtained); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the military judge, after taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding the taking of the statement, including the degree to which the statement is corroborated, the indicia of reliability within the statement itself, and whether the will of the declarant was overborne, determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the statement is probative on the point for which it is offered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) direct testimony from the witness is not available as a practical matter, taking into consideration the physical location of the witness, the unique circumstances of military and intelligence operations during hostilities, and the adverse impacts on military or intelligence operations that would likely result from the production of the witness; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) the general purposes of the rules of evidence and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The accused in a military commission under this chapter who exercises the right to self-representation under paragraph (2)(D) shall conform the accused's deportment and the conduct of the defense to the rules of evidence, procedure, and decorum applicable to trials by military commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Failure of the accused to conform to the rules described in subparagraph (A) may result in a partial or total revocation by the military judge of the right of self-representation under paragraph (2)(D). In such case, the military counsel of the accused or an appropriately authorized civilian counsel shall perform the functions necessary for the defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Delegation of Authority To Prescribe Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense may delegate the authority of the Secretary to prescribe regulations under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Notice to Congress of Modification of Rules</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 60 days before the date on which any proposed modification of the rules in effect for military commissions under this chapter goes into effect, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives a report describing the proposed modification.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;949p&ndash;6. Procedure for cases involving classified information</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Motion for Hearing.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Request for hearing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Within the time specified by the military judge for the filing of a motion under this section, either party may request the military judge to conduct a hearing to make all determinations concerning the use, relevance, or admissibility of classified information that would otherwise be made during the trial or pretrial proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Conduct of hearing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon a request by either party under paragraph (1), the military judge shall conduct such a hearing and shall rule prior to conducting any further proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>In camera hearing upon declaration to court by appropriate official of risk of dis<!-- PDFPage:496 -->closure of classified information</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any hearing held pursuant to this subsection (or any portion of such hearing specified in the request of a knowledgeable United States official) shall be held in camera if a knowledgeable United States official possessing authority to classify information submits to the military judge a declaration that a public proceeding may result in the disclosure of classified information. Classified information is not subject to disclosure under this section unless the information is relevant and necessary to an element of the offense or a legally cognizable defense and is otherwise admissible in evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Military judge to make determinations in writing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As to each item of classified information, the military judge shall set forth in writing the basis for the determination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Notice and Use of Classified Information by the Government.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Notice to accused</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before any hearing is conducted pursuant to a request by the trial counsel under subsection (a), trial counsel shall provide the accused with notice of the classified information that is at issue. Such notice shall identify the specific classified information at issue whenever that information previously has been made available to the accused by the United States. When the United States has not previously made the information available to the accused in connection with the case the information may be described by generic category, in such forms as the military judge may approve, rather than by identification of the specific information of concern to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Order by military judge upon request of accused</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever the trial counsel requests a hearing under subsection (a), the military judge, upon request of the accused, may order the trial counsel to provide the accused, prior to trial, such details as to the portion of the charge or specification at issue in the hearing as are needed to give the accused fair notice to prepare for the hearing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Substitutions.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In camera pretrial hearing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon request of the trial counsel pursuant to the Military Commission Rules of Evidence, and in accordance with the security procedures established by the military judge, the military judge shall conduct a classified in camera pretrial hearing concerning the admissibility of classified information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Protection of sources, methods, and activities by which evidence acquired</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When trial counsel seeks to introduce evidence before a military commission under this chapter and the Executive branch has classified the sources, methods, or activities by which the United States acquired the evidence, the military judge shall permit trial counsel to introduce the evidence, including a substituted evidentiary foundation pursuant to the procedures described in subsection (d), while protecting from disclosure information identifying those sources, methods, or activities, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the evidence is otherwise admissible; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the military judge finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the evidence is reliable; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the redaction is consistent with affording the accused a fair trial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Alternative Procedure for Disclosure of Classified Information.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Motion by the united states</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon any determination by the military judge authorizing the disclosure of specific classified information under the procedures established by this section, the trial counsel may move that, in lieu of the disclosure of such specific classified information, the military judge order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the substitution for such classified information of a statement admitting relevant facts that the specific classified information would tend to prove;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the substitution for such classified information of a summary of the specific classified information; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any other procedure or redaction limiting the disclosure of specific classified information.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Action on motion</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The military judge shall grant such a motion of the trial counsel if the military judge finds that the statement, summary, or other procedure or redaction will provide the defendant with substantially the same ability to make his defense as would disclosure of the specific classified information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Hearing on motion</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The military judge shall hold a hearing on any motion under this subsection. Any such hearing shall be held in camera at the request of a knowledgeable United States official possessing authority to classify information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Submission of statement of damage to national security if disclosure ordered</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The trial counsel may, in connection with a motion under paragraph (1), submit to the military judge a declaration signed by a knowledgeable United States official possessing authority to classify information certifying that disclosure of classified information would cause identifiable damage to the national security of the United States and explaining the basis for the classification of such information. If so requested by the trial counsel, the military judge shall examine such declaration during an ex parte presentation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Sealing of Records of in Camera Hearings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If at the close of an in camera hearing under this section (or any portion of a hearing under this section that is held in camera), the military judge determines that the classified information at issue may not be disclosed or elicited at the trial or pretrial proceeding, the record of such in camera hearing shall be sealed and preserved for use in the event of an appeal. The accused may seek reconsideration of the military judge's determination prior to or during trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition on Disclosure of Classified Information by the Accused; Relief for Accused When the United States Opposes Disclosure.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Order to prevent disclosure by accused</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever the military judge denies a motion by the trial counsel that the judge issue an order under subsection (a), (c), or (d) <!-- PDFPage:497 -->and the trial counsel files with the military judge a declaration signed by a knowledgeable United States official possessing authority to classify information objecting to disclosure of the classified information at issue, the military judge shall order that the accused not disclose or cause the disclosure of such information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Result of order under paragraph (1)</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever an accused is prevented by an order under paragraph (1) from disclosing or causing the disclosure of classified information, the military judge shall dismiss the case, except that, when the military judge determines that the interests of justice would not be served by dismissal of the case, the military judge shall order such other action, in lieu of dismissing the charge or specification, as the military judge determines is appropriate. Such action may include, but need not be limited to, the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Dismissing specified charges or specifications.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Finding against the United States on any issue as to which the excluded classified information relates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Striking or precluding all or part of the testimony of a witness.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Time for the united states to seek interlocutory appeal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An order under paragraph (2) shall not take effect until the military judge has afforded the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an opportunity to appeal such order under section 950d of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an opportunity thereafter to withdraw its objection to the disclosure of the classified information at issue.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Reciprocity.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure of rebuttal information</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever the military judge determines that classified information may be disclosed in connection with a trial or pretrial proceeding, the military judge shall, unless the interests of fairness do not so require, order the United States to provide the accused with the information it expects to use to rebut the classified information. The military judge may place the United States under a continuing duty to disclose such rebuttal information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Sanction for failure to comply</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the United States fails to comply with its obligation under this subsection, the military judge&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may exclude any evidence not made the subject of a required disclosure; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may prohibit the examination by the United States of any witness with respect to such information.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;949p&ndash;7. Introduction of classified information into evidence</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Preservation of Classification Status</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Writings, recordings, and photographs containing classified information may be admitted into evidence in proceedings of military commissions under this chapter without change in their classification status.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Precautions by Military Judges.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Precautions in admitting classified information into evidence</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The military judge in a trial by military commission, in order to prevent unnecessary disclosure of classified information, may order admission into evidence of only part of a writing, recording, or photograph, or may order admission into evidence of the whole writing, recording, or photograph with excision of some or all of the classified information contained therein, unless the whole ought in fairness be considered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Classified information kept under seal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The military judge shall allow classified information offered or accepted into evidence to remain under seal during the trial, even if such evidence is disclosed in the military commission, and may, upon motion by the United States, seal exhibits containing classified information for any period after trial as necessary to prevent a disclosure of classified information when a knowledgeable United States official possessing authority to classify information submits to the military judge a declaration setting forth the damage to the national security that the disclosure of such information reasonably could be expected to cause.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Taking of Testimony.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Objection by trial counsel</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;During the examination of a witness, trial counsel may object to any question or line of inquiry that may require the witness to disclose classified information not previously found to be admissible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Action by military judge</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Following an objection under paragraph (1), the military judge shall take such suitable action to determine whether the response is admissible as will safeguard against the compromise of any classified information. Such action may include requiring trial counsel to provide the military judge with a proffer of the witness&rsquo; response to the question or line of inquiry and requiring the accused to provide the military judge with a proffer of the nature of the information sought to be elicited by the accused. Upon request, the military judge may accept an ex parte proffer by trial counsel to the extent necessary to protect classified information from disclosure, in accordance with the practice of the Federal courts under the Classified Information Procedures Act (18 U.S.C. App.).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Disclosure at Trial of Certain Statements Previously Made by a Witness.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Motion for production of statements in possession of the united states</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After a witness called by the trial counsel has testified on direct examination, the military judge, on motion of the accused, may order production of statements of the witness in the possession of the United States which relate to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified. This paragraph does not preclude discovery or assertion of a privilege otherwise authorized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Invocation of privilege by the united states</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the United States invokes a privilege, the trial counsel may provide the prior <!-- PDFPage:498 -->statements of the witness to the military judge during an ex parte presentation to the extent necessary to protect classified information from disclosure, in accordance with the practice of the Federal courts under the Classified Information Procedures Act (18 U.S.C. App.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Action by military judge on motion</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the military judge finds that disclosure of any portion of the statement identified by the United States as classified would be detrimental to the national security in the degree to warrant classification under the applicable Executive Order, statute, or regulation, that such portion of the statement is consistent with the testimony of the witness, and that the disclosure of such portion is not necessary to afford the accused a fair trial, the military judge shall excise that portion from the statement. If the military judge finds that such portion of the statement is inconsistent with the testimony of the witness or that its disclosure is necessary to afford the accused a fair trial, the military judge, shall, upon the request of the trial counsel, review alternatives to disclosure in accordance with section 949p&ndash;6(d) of this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this subchapter:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;military objective&rdquo; means combatants and those objects during hostilities which, by their nature, location, purpose, or use, effectively contribute to the war-fighting or war-sustaining capability of an opposing force and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization would constitute a definite military advantage to the attacker under the circumstances at the time of an attack.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;protected person&rdquo; means any person entitled to protection under one or more of the Geneva Conventions, including civilians not taking an active part in hostilities, military personnel placed out of combat by sickness, wounds, or detention, and military medical or religious personnel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;protected property&rdquo; means any property specifically protected by the law of war, including buildings dedicated to religion, education, art, science, or charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals, and places where the sick and wounded are collected, but only if and to the extent such property is not being used for military purposes or is not otherwise a military objective. The term includes objects properly identified by one of the distinctive emblems of the Geneva Conventions, but does not include civilian property that is a military objective.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Construction of Certain Offenses</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The intent required for offenses under paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), and (12) of section 950t of this title precludes the applicability of such offenses with regard to collateral damage or to death, damage, or injury incident to a lawful attack.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Common Circumstances</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An offense specified in this subchapter is triable by military commission under this chapter only if the offense is committed in the context of and associated with hostilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Effect</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The provisions of this subchapter codify offenses that have traditionally been triable by military commission. This chapter does not establish new crimes that did not exist before the date of the enactment of this subchapter, as amended by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, but rather codifies those crimes for trial by military commission. Because the provisions of this subchapter codify offenses that have traditionally been triable under the law of war or otherwise triable by military commission, this subchapter does not preclude trial for offenses that occurred before the date of the enactment of this subchapter, as so amended.</p>
