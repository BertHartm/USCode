<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The provisions of this subchapter codify offenses that have traditionally been triable by military commissions. This chapter does not establish new crimes that did not exist before its enactment, but rather codifies those crimes for trial by military commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Effect</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Because the provisions of this subchapter (including provisions that incorporate definitions in other provisions of law) are declarative of existing law, they do not preclude trial for crimes that occurred before the date of the enactment of this chapter.</p>
