<p class="note-body">The new subsection (e) is necessary to reflect the last 11 words of the second sentence of section 4 of the Army Aviation Cadet Act (formerly 10 U.S.C. 304), which were omitted from the original military codification act, the Act of August 10, 1956, chapter 1041, as part of the source law for section 20(b) of that Act (70A Stat. 627). See Senate Report No. 2484, 84th Congress, 2d Session, page 738. Since the source law did not permit the payment of a money allowance to an aviation cadet in place of the issuance of uniforms, clothing, and equipment, as may be done for enlisted members generally, it is necessary to restate this provision separately.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Any former enlisted member of the Regular Air Force who has served on active duty as a reserve officer of the Air Force, or who was discharged as an enlisted member to accept a temporary appointment as an officer of the Air Force, is entitled to be reenlisted in the Regular Air Force in the enlisted grade that he held before his service as an officer, without loss of seniority or credit for service, regardless of the existence of a vacancy in his grade or of a physical disability incurred or having its inception in line of duty, if (1) his service as an officer is terminated by an honorable discharge or he is relieved from active duty for a purpose other than to await appellate review of a sentence that includes dismissal or dishonorable discharge, and (2) he applies for reenlistment within six months (or such other period as the Secretary of the Air Force prescribes for exceptional circumstances) after termination of that service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A person is not entitled to be reenlisted under this section if&mdash;</p>
