<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;including aircraft&rdquo; are omitted as covered by subsection (b). The section is written to make the words &ldquo;during war&rdquo; applicable to the entire chapter. These words appear in 34 U.S.C. 1159, but not in 34 U.S.C. 1131. Prize is historically and uniformly treated as a war-time matter, so no substantive change results from the extension. The words &ldquo;this chapter does not affect&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;nothing herein contained shall be construed as affecting, or in any way impairing&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;Air Force&rdquo; are added under authority of &sect;305(a) of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (5 U.S.C. 171<em>l</em>), to provide the same applicability as formerly provided by the word &ldquo;Army&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;legal&rdquo; is omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the definition of the term &ldquo;ship&rdquo; is omitted as covered by the term &ldquo;vessel&rdquo;. All of 34 U.S.C. 1132 except that part which includes &ldquo;aircraft&rdquo; within the term &ldquo;vessels&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary since the defined term &ldquo;vessels of the Navy&rdquo; does not appear in the provisions to which the definition is made applicable. The last sentence of 34 U.S.C. 1158 applies only to Title LIV (Prize) of the Revised Statutes. In subsection (d) it is broadened to cover the entire body of statutory prize law. Additions to the prize law made by the Act of August 18, 1942, ch. 553, 56 Stat. 746, as amended, operated only to extend the jurisdiction of courts of the United States to certain cases in which the prizes are not brought into the territorial waters of the United States. Relations of this country with other countries are not affected by the 1942 Act except when jurisdiction is exercised by American courts over prizes brought into cobelligerent ports. As that Act provides that the consent of the cobelligerent is necessary to the exercise of such jurisdiction, the rule against contravention of treaties is properly applied to it.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) reflects 28 U.S.C. 1333 by restating the basic prize jurisdiction of that section over prizes brought into the United States, and by providing that the extension of prize jurisdiction conferred by 34 U.S.C. 1159 on the United States district courts is exclusive of the courts of the States. 34 U.S.C. 1166 and the second sentence of 34 U.S.C. 1164 are executed in the single jurisdictional statement of this section and the consolidation of the Act of August 18, 1942, ch. 553, 56 Stat. 746 (34 U.S.C. 1159&ndash;1166) with the earlier prize provisions. The words &ldquo;during war&rdquo; in 34 U.S.C. 1159 are omitted as covered in &sect;7651 of this title. In clause (1) the words &ldquo;or the Territories, Commonwealths, or possessions&rdquo; are added, since &ldquo;United States&rdquo; in this title is geographically limited to the 48 States and the District of Columbia, whereas the term here is intended to include all places within the jurisdiction of the district courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (4) the words &ldquo;taken or&rdquo; preceding the words &ldquo;appropriated for the use of the United States&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage and in order to avoid confusion between the two meanings of the word &ldquo;taken&rdquo; in prize law. In both the Revised Statutes and the 1942 Act the phrase &ldquo;taken or appropriated&rdquo; means no more than &ldquo;appropriated&rdquo; alone, whereas &ldquo;taken&rdquo;, in the phrase &ldquo;taken as prize&rdquo; means &ldquo;captured&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is included to make the statement of jurisdiction complete. It is derived by implication from the first sentence of R.S. 4625 (34 U.S.C. 1141) which is the source of subsection (c) of &sect;7653 of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is inserted in order to present a complete statement of the subject matter of the section. Its substance is not specifically set out in the Revised Statutes but is strongly implied in 34 U.S.C. 1135 which requires the United States attorney for the district in which the port is located to file a libel.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the requisites for jurisdiction conferred under the 1942 Act are substituted for the words &ldquo;brought under the jurisdiction conferred by this Act&rdquo;. The substituted words are the same as those used in clauses (2), (3), and (4) of the preceding section except that the words &ldquo;before proceedings are started&rdquo; are added following the words &ldquo;appropriated for the use of the United States&rdquo; for clarity. An appropriation can take place before or after proceedings are commenced, but in the latter case there is no occasion for the Attorney General to determine venue.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c) the words &ldquo;or if because the whole has been appropriated to the use of the United States&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;or the value of anything taken or appropriated for the use of the United States&rdquo; are omitted. The provision in the 1942 Act which empowers the Attorney General to decide the venue of proceedings when the prize property has been appropriated is incompatible with the provision in R.S. 4625 which authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to select the judicial district in such cases. Hence the 1942 Act superseded R.S. 4625 with respect to cases of this type. Deposit of the value of prize property appropriated by the United States is adequately covered in &sect;7663 of this title and is not mentioned here. The second sentence of 34 U.S.C. 1141 (R.S. 4625), relating to proceedings by captors, is omitted because it was rendered inoperative by the Act of March 3, 1899, ch. 413, &sect;13, 30 Stat. 1007, which repealed all laws authorizing the distribution of prize money to captors.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In each judicial district there may be not more than three prize commissioners, one of whom is the naval prize commissioner. They shall be appointed by the district court for service in connection with any prize cause in which proceedings are brought under section 7653(a) or (c) of this title. The naval prize commissioner must be an officer of the Navy whose appointment is approved by the Secretary of the Navy. The naval prize commissioner shall protect the interests of the Department of the Navy in the prize property. At least one of the other commissioners must be a member of the bar of the court, of not less than three years&rsquo; standing, who is experienced in taking depositions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A district court may appoint special prize commissioners to perform abroad, in connection with any prize cause in which proceedings are brought under section 7653(b) of this title, the duties prescribed for prize commissioners, and, in connection with those causes, to exercise anywhere such additional powers and perform such additional duties as the court considers proper, including the duties prescribed by this chapter for United States marshals. The court may determine the number and qualifications of the special prize commissioners it appoints, except that for each cause there shall be at least one naval special prize commissioner. The naval special prize commissioner must be an officer of the Navy whose appointment is approved by the Secretary. The naval special prize commissioner shall protect the interests of the Department of the Navy in the prize property.</p>

<p class="note-body">The first sentence of subsection (a) is reworded to make it clear that the limitation as to number applies <!-- PDFPage:1456 -->to the number of prize commissioners who may serve in each judicial district at any one time and that the court is not precluded from making additional appointments to fill vacancies. The words &ldquo;for service in connection with any prize cause in which proceedings are brought under section 7653(a) or (c) of this title&rdquo; are added to distinguish the prize commissioners from the special prize commissioners mentioned in subsection (b). The words &ldquo;officer of the Navy&rdquo; in subsections (a) and (b) are substituted for the words &ldquo;naval officer, active or retired&rdquo; because an officer of the Navy does not lose his status as such upon retirement, and to retain these words would open to question the many other provisions in this subtitle treating retired officers as officers.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the words &ldquo;in connection with any prize cause in which proceedings are brought under section 7653(b) of this title&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;in cases arising under this Act&rdquo; for accuracy of reference. The words &ldquo;including the duties prescribed by this chapter for United States marshals&rdquo; are added for clarity. Section 7662 of this title prescribes the duties of marshals. Most of these duties could not be performed by the marshals if the prize was not brought into a United States port. In such cases occurring during World War II the courts, under the authority of the 1942 Act, required the special prize commissioners to perform the duties ordinarily performed by the marshals. The words &ldquo;without regard for the requirements of section 7367 of this title&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary, since that section is codified in subsection (a), and language distinguishing the prize commissioners from the special prize commissions is included in each subsection.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Any officer or agency designated by the President may appropriate for the use of the United States any captured vessel, arms, munitions, or other material taken as prize. The department or agency for whose use the prize property is appropriated shall deposit the value of the property with the Treasurer of the United States or with the public depositary nearest to the court in which the proceedings are to be had, subject to the orders of the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Whenever any captured vessel, arms, munitions, or other material taken as prize is appropriated for the use of the United States before that property comes into the custody of the prize court, it shall be surveyed, appraised, and inventoried by persons as competent and impartial as can be obtained, and the survey, appraisal, and inventory sent to the court in which the proceedings are to be had. If the property is appropriated after it comes into the custody of the court, sufficient notice shall be given to enable the court to have the property appraised for the protection of the rights of the claimants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), in any case where prize property is appropriated for the use of the United States, a prize court may adjudicate the cause on the basis of an inventory and survey and an appropriate undertaking by the United States to respond for the value of the property, without either an appraisal or a deposit of the value of the prize with the Treasurer of the United States or a public depositary.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;may appropriate&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;the power to take or appropriate * * * may be exercised&rdquo;, in 34 U.S.C. 1162, for clarity and uniformity of statement. Under the Revised Statutes it was implied and understood that the Navy could appropriate prizes on behalf of the United States for use by the Navy. Use by other government agencies was not contemplated. The 1942 Act enabled the Navy to turn prize vessels over to the War Shipping Administration without bringing them back to United States ports. Reference to that Administration in subsection (a) is omitted since the Administration has been abolished and these functions have not been specifically vested in its successors. It is surplusage as well, because the authority to appropriate is given to any officer or agency designated by the President.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proviso added to R.S. 4624 (34 U.S.C. 1140) by the 1945 amendment is identical with the proviso added to the 1942 Act (34 U.S.C. 1162) by the 1944 amendment. The 1945 Act completed the process of making the procedure under the Revised Statutes the same as that in effect for causes over which the courts were given jurisdiction by the World War II legislation, and its single statement in subsection (c) is therefore justified.</p>
<p class="note-body">34 U.S.C. 1140 and the revised section reflect the Act of March 3, 1899, ch. 413, &sect;13, 30 Stat. 1007, which repealed laws authorizing distribution of prize proceeds to captors, and the Act of May 29, 1920, ch. 214, 41 Stat. 654, which requires substitution of &ldquo;Treasurer of the United States or public depositary&rdquo; for &ldquo;assistant treasurer&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (c) the words &ldquo;restore the property&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;adjudge to be restored.&rdquo; A similar substitution is made in subsection (d).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d) the words &ldquo;foreign government&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;foreign prince, government, or state&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (e) is derived from the next to the last sentence of R.S. 4652 which, when enacted, read:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The whole amount awarded as salvage shall be decreed to the captors and no part to the United States, and shall be distributed as in the case of proceeds of property condemned as prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Act of March 3, 1899, ch. 413, &sect;13, 30 Stat. 1007, repealed all laws authorizing the distribution of prize money to captors. Accordingly, 34 U.S.C. 1158 states:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The whole amount awarded as salvage shall be disposed of as in the case of proceeds of property condemned as prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">As shown in &sect;7668 of this title, the net proceeds of property condemned as prize must be decreed to the <!-- PDFPage:1461 -->United States. Subsection (e) is phrased so as to state directly, instead of by reference, the fact that the amount awarded as salvage is paid to the government. While this is apparently inconsistent with R.S. 4652 as originally enacted, it is consistent with the intent expressed by Congress in the provision of the Act of March 3, 1899 (supra), which repealed provisions relating to the distribution of prize money and bounty to crews. This act, it is true, did not mention salvage; and salvage money is still occasionally awarded to crews of naval vessels. However, such occasions are rare, and it is the general policy of the Department of the Navy not to claim salvage on behalf of its personnel. No case appears in which salvage derived from prize has been claimed for such personnel. Prize salvage is more closely related to prize money than it is to other salvage. The determination by Congress that captors should not share in the proceeds of prizes is, therefore, as in 34 U.S.C. 1158, carried through the revised section to salvage derived from prize. The word &ldquo;amounts&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;the whole amount&rdquo;.</p>
