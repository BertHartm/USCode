<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) increase the maximum strength authorized pursuant to subsection (b)(1) for a fiscal year for certain reserves on active duty for any of the reserve components by a number equal to not more than 10 percent of that strength.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Authority for Service Secretary Variances for Active-Duty End Strengths</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon determination by the Secretary of a military department that such action would enhance manning and readiness in essential units or in critical specialties or ratings, the Secretary may increase the end strength authorized pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(A) for a fiscal year for the armed force under the jurisdiction of that Secretary or, in the case of the Secretary of the Navy, for any of the armed forces under the jurisdiction of that Secretary. Any such increase for a fiscal year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall be by a number equal to not more than 2 percent of such authorized end strength; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall be counted as part of the increase for that armed force for that fiscal year authorized under subsection (f)(1).</p>
