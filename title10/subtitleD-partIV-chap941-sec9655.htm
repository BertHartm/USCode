The words &ldquo;and not properly expended&rdquo; are inserted for clarity. The words &ldquo;United States&rdquo; are substituted for the word &ldquo;Government&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;their&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;suitable *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* for use therewith&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;it is no longer needed&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;the necessity for their use has expired&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;hereafter&rdquo;, &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo;, and &ldquo;under the authority of this section&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.</p>
