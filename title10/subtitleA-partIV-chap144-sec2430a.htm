<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall notify the congressional defense committees in writing of any proposed designation pursuant to paragraph (1) not less than 30 days before the date such designation takes effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Reporting Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary designates a major subprogram of a major defense acquisition program in accordance with subsection (a), Selected Acquisition Reports, unit cost reports, and program baselines under this chapter shall reflect cost, schedule, and performance information&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for the major defense acquisition program as a whole; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for each major subprogram of the major defense acquisition program so designated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Requirement to Cover Entire Major Defense Acquisition Program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a subprogram of a major defense acquisition program is designated as a major subprogram under subsection (a), all other elements of the major defense acquisition program shall be appropriately organized into one or more subprograms under the major defense acquisition program, each of which subprograms, as so organized, shall be treated as a major subprogram under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 2432(a) of this title, in the case of a major defense acquisition program for which the Secretary has designated one or more major subprograms under this section for the purposes of this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;program acquisition unit cost&rdquo; applies at the level of the subprogram and means the total cost for the development and procurement of, and specific military construction for, the major defense acquisition program that is reasonably allocable to each such major subprogram, divided by the relevant number of fully-configured end items to be produced under such major subprogram;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;procurement unit cost&rdquo; applies at the level of the subprogram and means the total of all funds programmed to be available for obligation for procurement for each such major subprogram, divided by the number of fully-configured end items to be procured under such major subprogram;</p>
