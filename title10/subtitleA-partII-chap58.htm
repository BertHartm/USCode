<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the men and women serving in our Nation's Armed Forces are of the highest caliber&mdash;intelligent, dedicated, and disciplined&mdash;and hundreds of thousands of these service members will be separating from the Armed Forces due to the drawdown in military personnel;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) these men and women will be entering the civilian workforce during a time of economic instability and uncertainty;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) many of these service personnel specialized in critical skills such as combat arms which will not transfer to the civilian workforce;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) as part of the Nation's obligation to these service members, the Secretary of Defense has a unique responsibility and obligation to provide them with the tools they need to be reassimilated into the civilian community and continue to be outstanding, productive citizens;</p>
