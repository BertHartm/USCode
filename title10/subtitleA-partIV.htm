<p class="note-body">Section is based on Pub. L. 99&ndash;190, &sect;101(b) [title VIII, &sect;8009], Dec. 19, 1985, 99 Stat. 1185, 1204.  </p>
<p class="note-body">In two instances, the source law to be codified by the bill includes provisions that on their face require that the Department of Defense notify Congress of certain actions. These notification requirements were terminated by section 602 of the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 (Public Law 99&ndash;433), which terminated all recurring reporting requirements applicable to the Department of Defense except for those requirements that were specifically exempted in that section. The source law sections are sections 8009(c) and 8005(j) (proviso) of the FY86 defense appropriations Act (Public Law 99&ndash;190), enacted December 19, 1985, which would be codified as section 2201 of title 10 (by section 1(d) of the bill) and section 7313(a) of title 10 (by section 1(n) of the bill). In codifying the authorities provided the Department of Defense by these two provisions of law, the committee believes that it is appropriate to reinstate the congressional notification requirements that go with those authorities. These sections were recurring annual appropriation provisions for many years and were made permanent only months before the enactment of the 1986 Reorganization Act. It is the committee's belief that the failure to exempt these provisions from the general reports termination provision was inadvertent and notes that the notification provisions had in fact previously applied to the Department of Defense for many years. The action of the committee restores the status quo as it existed before the Reorganization Act.  </p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) To conduct economically and efficiently the operations of the Department of Defense that are financed by at least two appropriations but whose costs cannot be immediately distributed and charged to those appropriations, there is the Army Management Fund, the Navy Management Fund, and the Air Force Management Fund, each within its respective department and under the direction of the Secretary of that department. Each such fund shall consist of a corpus of $1,000,000 and such amounts as may be appropriated thereto from time to time. An account for an operation that is to be financed by such a fund may be established only with the approval of the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Under such regulations as the Secretary of Defense may prescribe, expenditures may be made from a management fund for material (other than for stock), personal services, and services under contract. However, obligation may not be incurred against that fund if it is not chargeable to funds available under an appropriation of the department concerned or funds of another department or agency of the Department of Defense. The fund shall be promptly reimbursed from those funds for expenditures made from it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, advances, by check or warrant, or reimbursements, may be made from available appropriations to a management fund on the basis of the estimated cost of a project. As adequate data becomes available, the estimated cost shall be revised and necessary adjustments made. Final adjustment shall be made with the appropriate funds for the fiscal year in which the advances or reimbursements are made. Except as otherwise provided by law, amounts advanced to management funds are available for obligation only during the fiscal year in which they are advanced.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) of this section and sections 2253(b) and 2661(a) of this title are based on Pub. L. 98&ndash;212, title VII, &sect;735, Dec. 8, 1983, 97 Stat. 1444, as amended by Pub. L. 98&ndash;525, title XIV, &sect;&sect;1403(a)(2), 1404, Oct. 19, 1984, 98 Stat. 2621.</p>
<p class="note-body">In two instances, the source section for provisions to be codified provides that defense appropriations may be used for &ldquo;welfare and recreation&rdquo; or &ldquo;welfare and recreational&rdquo; purposes. (Section 735 of Public Law 98&ndash;212 and section 8006(b) of Public Law 99&ndash;190, to be codified as 10 U.S.C. 2241(a)(1) and 2490(2), respectively). The committee added the term &ldquo;morale&rdquo; in both of these two instances to conform to the usual &ldquo;MWR&rdquo; usage for morale, welfare, and recreation activities.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) of this section and sections 2242(1), (4) and 2253(a)(1) of this title are based on Pub. L. 98&ndash;212, title VII, &sect;705, Dec. 8, 1983, 97 Stat. 1437.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 705 of Public Law 98&ndash;212, to be codified as 10 U.S.C. 2241(b), provides that defense appropriations may be used in connection with certain services and supplies &ldquo;as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act&rdquo;. The reference to &ldquo;this Act&rdquo; means Public Law 98&ndash;212, the FY84 Defense Appropriations Act. Language similar to section 705 had been enacted as part of the annual defense appropriation Act for many years. In the FY84 Act, section 705 was enacted as a permanent provision. The quoted phrase above was not, however, revised from the traditional annual wording as the provision had appeared in annual appropriations Acts in order to give it effect beyond the fiscal <!-- PDFPage:637 -->year concerned. Since the general purpose of a defense appropriations Act is to provide funds for national defense purposes, the committee, in codifying this provision, revised the quoted phrase so as to read &ldquo;that may be necessary for the national defense&rdquo;. No change in meaning is intended.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Whenever the Secretary of a military department conducts an accident investigation of an accident involving an aircraft under the jurisdiction of the Secretary, the records and report of the investigations shall be treated in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this section, an accident investigation is any form of investigation of an aircraft accident other than an investigation (known as a &ldquo;safety investigation&rdquo;) that is conducted solely to determine the cause of the accident and to obtain information that may prevent the occurrence of similar accidents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Public Disclosure of Certain Accident Investigation Information</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary concerned, upon request, shall publicly disclose unclassified tapes, scientific reports, and other factual information pertinent to an aircraft accident investigation, before the release of the final accident investigation report relating to the accident, if the Secretary concerned determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that such tapes, reports, or other information would be included within and releasable with the final accident investigation report; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that release of such tapes, reports, or other information&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) would not undermine the ability of accident or safety investigators to continue to conduct the investigation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) would not compromise national security.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A disclosure under paragraph (1) may not be made by or through officials with responsibility for, or who are conducting, a safety investigation with respect to the accident.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Opinions Regarding Causation of Accident</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Following a military aircraft accident&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if the evidence surrounding the accident is sufficient for the investigators who conduct the accident investigation to come to an opinion (or opinions) as to the cause or causes of <!-- PDFPage:641 -->the accident, the final report of the accident investigation shall set forth the opinion (or opinions) of the investigators as to the cause or causes of the accident; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the evidence surrounding the accident is not sufficient for those investigators to come to an opinion as to the cause or causes of the accident, the final report of the accident investigation shall include a description of those factors, if any, that, in the opinion of the investigators, substantially contributed to or caused the accident.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Use of Information in Civil Proceedings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of any civil or criminal proceeding arising from an aircraft accident, any opinion of the accident investigators as to the cause of, or the factors contributing to, the accident set forth in the accident investigation report may not be considered as evidence in such proceeding, nor may such information be considered an admission of liability by the United States or by any person referred to in those conclusions or statements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of each military department shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:653 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive procedures that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the competitive procedure appropriate under the circumstances, the head of an agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall solicit sealed bids if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) time permits the solicitation, submission, and evaluation of sealed bids;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the award will be made on the basis of price and other price-related factors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) it is not necessary to conduct discussions with the responding sources about their bids; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall request competitive proposals if sealed bids are not appropriate under clause (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The head of an agency may provide for the procurement of property or services covered by this chapter using competitive procedures but excluding a particular source in order to establish or maintain an alternative source or sources of supply for that property or service if the head of the agency determines that to do so&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) would increase or maintain competition and would likely result in reduced overall costs for such procurement, or for any anticipated procurement, of property or services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) would be in the interest of national defense in having a facility (or a producer, manufacturer, or other supplier) available for furnishing the property or service in case of a national emergency or industrial mobilization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) would be in the interest of national defense in establishing or maintaining an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) would ensure the continuous availability of a reliable source of supply of such property or service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) would satisfy projected needs for such property or service determined on the basis of a history of high demand for the property or service; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) in the case of medical supplies, safety supplies, or emergency supplies, would satisfy a critical need for such supplies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an agency may provide for the procurement of property or services covered by this section using competitive procedures, but excluding concerns other than small business concerns in furtherance of sections 9 and 15 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638, 644) and concerns other than small business concerns, historically Black colleges and universities, and minority institutions in furtherance of section 2323 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the agency's need for the property or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the United States would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order (A) to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing property or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization, (B) to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center, or (C) to procure the services of an expert for use, in any litigation or dispute (including any reasonably foreseeable litigation or dispute) involving the Federal Government, in any trial, hearing, or proceeding before any court, administrative tribunal, or agency, or in any part of an alternative dispute resolution process, whether or not the expert is expected to testify;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the terms of an international agreement or a treaty between the United States and a foreign government or international organization, or the written directions of a foreign government reimbursing the agency for the cost of the procurement of the property or services for such government, have the effect of requiring the use of procedures other than competitive procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) subject to subsection (j), a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the procurement be made through another agency or from a specified source, or the agency's need is for a brand-name commercial item for authorized resale;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the disclosure of the agency's needs would compromise the national security unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the head of the agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) determines that it is necessary in the public interest to use procedures other than competitive procedures in the particular procurement concerned, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) notifies the Congress in writing of such determination not less than 30 days before the award of the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) For the purposes of applying subsection (c)(1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a contract for property or services to be awarded on the basis of acceptance of an unsolicited research proposal, the <!-- PDFPage:654 -->property or services shall be considered to be available from only one source if the source has submitted an unsolicited research proposal that demonstrates a concept&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) that is unique and innovative or, in the case of a service, for which the source demonstrates a unique capability of the source to provide the service; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1)(A) In preparing for the procurement of property or services, the head of an agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) specify the agency's needs and solicit bids or proposals in a manner designed to achieve full and open competition for the procurement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) use advance procurement planning and market research; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) develop specifications in such manner as is necessary to obtain full and open competition with due regard to the nature of the property or services to be acquired.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Each solicitation under this chapter shall include specifications which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) consistent with the provisions of this chapter, permit full and open competition; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to satisfy the needs of the agency or as authorized by law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For the purposes of subparagraphs (A) and (B), the type of specification included in a solicitation shall depend on the nature of the needs of the agency and the market available to satisfy such needs. Subject to such needs, specifications may be stated in terms of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) function, so that a variety of products or services may qualify;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) performance, including specifications of the range of acceptable characteristics or of the minimum acceptable standards; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) design requirements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to the specifications described in paragraph (1), a solicitation for sealed bids or competitive proposals (other than for a purchase for an amount not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold) shall at a minimum include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a statement of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) all significant factors and significant subfactors which the head of the agency reasonably expects to consider in evaluating sealed bids (including price) or competitive proposals (including cost or price, cost-related or price-related factors and subfactors, and noncost-related or nonprice-related factors and subfactors); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the relative importance assigned to each of those factors and subfactors; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) in the case of sealed bids&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) a statement that sealed bids will be evaluated without discussions with the bidders; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the time and place for the opening of the sealed bids; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of competitive proposals&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) either a statement that the proposals are intended to be evaluated with, and award made after, discussions with the offerors, or a statement that the proposals are intended to be evaluated, and award made, without discussions with the offerors (other than discussions conducted for the purpose of minor clarification) unless discussions are determined to be necessary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the time and place for submission of proposals.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In prescribing the evaluation factors to be included in each solicitation for competitive proposals, the head of an agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall clearly establish the relative importance assigned to the evaluation factors and subfactors, including the quality of the product or services to be provided (including technical capability, management capability, prior experience, and past performance of the offeror);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) shall include cost or price to the Federal Government as an evaluation factor that must be considered in the evaluation of proposals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) shall disclose to offerors whether all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) significantly more important than cost or price;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) approximately equal in importance to cost or price; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) significantly less important than cost or price.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The regulations implementing clause (iii) of subparagraph (A) may not define the terms &ldquo;significantly more important&rdquo; and &ldquo;significantly less important&rdquo; as specific numeric weights that would be applied uniformly to all solicitations or a class of solicitations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subsection prohibits an agency from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) providing additional information in a solicitation, including numeric weights for all evaluation factors and subfactors on a case-by-case basis; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) stating in a solicitation that award will be made to the offeror that meets the solicitation's mandatory requirements at the lowest cost or price.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The head of an agency, in issuing a solicitation for a contract to be awarded using sealed bid procedures, may not include in such solicitation a clause providing for the evaluation of prices for options to purchase additional property or services under the contract unless the head of the agency has determined that there is a reasonable likelihood that the options will be exercised.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The head of an agency shall evaluate sealed bids and competitive proposals and make an award based solely on the factors specified in the solicitation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) All sealed bids or competitive proposals received in response to a solicitation may be rejected if the head of the agency determines that such action is in the public interest.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:667 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) Sealed bids shall be opened publicly at the time and place stated in the solicitation. The head of the agency shall evaluate the bids in accordance with paragraph (1) without discussions with the bidders and, except as provided in paragraph (2), shall award a contract with reasonable promptness to the responsible bidder whose bid conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the United States, considering only price and the other price-related factors included in the solicitation. The award of a contract shall be made by transmitting, in writing or by electronic means, notice of the award to the successful bidder. Within three days after the date of contract award, the head of the agency shall notify, in writing or by electronic means, each bidder not awarded the contract that the contract has been awarded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The head of an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals in accordance with paragraph (1) and may award a contract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) after discussions with the offerors, provided that written or oral discussions have been conducted with all responsible offerors who submit proposals within the competitive range; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) based on the proposals received, without discussions with the offerors (other than discussions conducted for the purpose of minor clarification) provided that the solicitation included a statement that proposals are intended to be evaluated, and award made, without discussions, unless discussions are determined to be necessary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the head of the agency shall award a contract with reasonable promptness to the responsible source whose proposal is most advantageous to the United States, considering only cost or price and the other factors included in the solicitation. The head of the agency shall award the contract by transmitting, in writing or by electronic means, notice of the award to such source and, within three days after the date of contract award, shall notify, in writing or by electronic means, all other offerors of the rejection of their proposals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Subparagraph (B) does not apply with respect to the award of a contract for the acquisition of perishable subsistence items.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) When a contract is awarded by the head of an agency on the basis of competitive proposals, an unsuccessful offeror, upon written request received by the agency within 3 days after the date on which the unsuccessful offeror receives the notification of the contract award, shall be debriefed and furnished the basis for the selection decision and contract award. The head of the agency shall debrief the offeror within, to the maximum extent practicable, five days after receipt of the request by the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The debriefing shall include, at a minimum&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the offeror's offer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the overall evaluated cost and technical rating of the offer of the contractor awarded the contract and the overall evaluated cost and technical rating of the offer of the debriefed offeror;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the overall ranking of all offers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) a summary of the rationale for the award;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) in the case of a proposal that includes a commercial item that is an end item under the contract, the make and model of the item being provided in accordance with the offer of the contractor awarded the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The debriefing may not include point-by-point comparisons of the debriefed offeror's offer with other offers and may not disclose any information that is exempt from disclosure under section 552(b) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Each solicitation for competitive proposals shall include a statement that information described in subparagraph (B) may be disclosed in post-award debriefings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) If, within one year after the date of the contract award and as a result of a successful procurement protest, the agency seeks to fulfill the requirement under the protested contract either on the basis of a new solicitation of offers or on the basis of new best and final offers requested for that contract, the agency shall make available to all offerors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the information provided in debriefings under this paragraph regarding the offer of the contractor awarded the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the same information that would have been provided to the original offerors.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(F) The contracting officer shall include a summary of the debriefing in the contract file.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) If the head of an agency considers that a bid or proposal evidences a violation of the antitrust laws, he shall refer the bid or proposal to the Attorney General for appropriate action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that before a contract for the delivery of supplies to the Department of Defense is entered into&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) when the appropriate officials of the Department are making an assessment of the most advantageous source for acquisition of the supplies (considering quality, price, delivery, and other factors), there is a review of the availability and cost of each item of supply&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) through the supply system of the Department of Defense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) under standard Government supply contracts, if the item is in a category of supplies defined under regulations of the Secretary of Defense as being potentially available under a standard Government supply contract; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there is a review of both the procurement history of the item and a description of the item, including, when necessary for an adequate description of the item, a picture, drawing, diagram, or other graphic representation of the item.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1)(A) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that, in preparing a solicitation for the award of a development contract for a major system, the head of an agency consider requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer pro<!-- PDFPage:668 -->posals described in subparagraph (B). In determining whether to require such proposals, the head of the agency shall give due consideration to the purposes for which the system is being procured and the technology necessary to meet the system's required capabilities. If such proposals are required, the head of the agency shall consider them in evaluating the offeror's price.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Proposals referred to in the first sentence of subparagraph (A) are the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Proposals to incorporate in the design of the major system items which are currently available within the supply system of the Federal agency responsible for the major system, available elsewhere in the national supply system, or commercially available from more than one source.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) With respect to items that are likely to be required in substantial quantities during the system's service life, proposals to incorporate in the design of the major system items which the United States will be able to acquire competitively in the future.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that, in preparing a solicitation for the award of a production contract for a major system, the head of an agency consider requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer proposals described in subparagraph (B). In determining whether to require such proposals, the head of the agency shall give due consideration to the purposes for which the system is being procured and the technology necessary to meet the system's required capabilities. If such proposals are required, the head of the agency shall consider them in evaluating the offeror's price.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Proposals referred to in the first sentence of subparagraph (A) are proposals identifying opportunities to ensure that the United States will be able to obtain on a competitive basis items procured in connection with the system that are likely to be reprocured in substantial quantities during the service life of the system. Proposals submitted in response to such requirement may include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Proposals to provide to the United States the right to use technical data to be provided under the contract for competitive reprocurement of the item, together with the cost to the United States, if any, of acquiring such technical data and the right to use such data.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Proposals for the qualification or development of multiple sources of supply for the item.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the head of an agency is making a noncompetitive award of a development contract or a production contract for a major system, the factors specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) to be considered in evaluating an offer for a contract may be considered as objectives in negotiating the contract to be awarded. Such objectives may not impair the rights of prospective contractors or subcontractors otherwise provided by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Whenever the head of an agency requires that proposals described in paragraph (1)(B) or (2)(B) be submitted by an offeror in its offer, the offeror shall not be required to provide a proposal that enables the United States to acquire competitively in the future an identical item if the item was developed exclusively at private expense unless the head of the agency determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the original supplier of such item will be unable to satisfy program schedule or delivery requirements; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) proposals by the original supplier of such item to meet the mobilization requirements are insufficient to meet the agency's mobilization needs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In considering offers in response to a solicitation requiring proposals described in paragraph (1)(B) or (2)(B), the head of an agency shall base any evaluation of items developed exclusively at private expense on an analysis of the total value, in terms of innovative design, life-cycle costs, and other pertinent factors, of incorporating such items in the system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Protest File</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If, in the case of a solicitation for a contract issued by, or an award or proposed award of a contract by, the head of an agency, a protest is filed pursuant to the procedures in subchapter V of chapter 35 of title 31 and an actual or prospective offeror so requests, a file of the protest shall be established by the procuring activity and reasonable access shall be provided to actual or prospective offerors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Information exempt from disclosure under section 552 of title 5 may be redacted in a file established pursuant to paragraph (1) unless an applicable protective order provides otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Regulations implementing this subsection shall be consistent with the regulations regarding the preparation and submission of an agency's protest file (the so-called &ldquo;rule 4 file&rdquo;) for protests to the General Services Board of Contract Appeals under section 111 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 759).<sup><a href="#2305_1_target" name="2305_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Agency Actions on Protests</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, in connection with a protest, the head of an agency determines that a solicitation, proposed award, or award does not comply with the requirements of law or regulation, the head of the agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may take any action set out in subparagraphs (A) through (F) of subsection (b)(1) of section 3554 of title 31; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may pay costs described in paragraph (1) of section 3554(c) of title 31 within the limits referred to in paragraph (2) of such section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2306. Kinds of contracts</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost system of contracting may not be used. Subject to the limitation in the preceding sentence, the other provisions of this section, and other applicable provisions of law, the head of an agency, in awarding contracts under this chapter after using procedures other than sealed-bid procedures, may enter into any kind of contract that he considers will promote the best interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Each contract awarded under this chapter after using procedures other than sealed-bid pro<!-- PDFPage:671 -->cedures shall contain a warranty, determined to be suitable by the head of the agency, that the contractor has employed or retained no person or selling agency to solicit or obtain the contract under an understanding or agreement for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee, except a bona fide employee or established commercial or selling agency maintained by him to obtain business. If a contractor breaks such a warranty the United States may annul the contract without liability or may deduct the commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee from the contract price or consideration. This subsection does not apply to a contract that is for an amount not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold or to a contract for the acquisition of commercial items.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">[(c) Repealed. Pub. L. 103&ndash;355, title I, &sect;1021, Oct. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 3257.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The fee for performing a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract for experimental, developmental, or research work may not be more than 15 percent of the estimated cost of the contract, not including the fee. The fee for performing a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract for architectural or engineering services for a public work or utility plus the cost of those services to the contractor may not be more than 6 percent of the estimated cost of that work or project, not including fees. The fee for performing any other cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract may not be more than 10 percent of the estimated cost of the contract, not including the fee. Determinations under this subsection of the estimated costs of a contract or project shall be made by the head of the agency at the time the contract is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Each cost contract and each cost-plus-a- fixed-fee contract shall provide for notice to the agency by the contractor before the making, under the prime contract, of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee subcontract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a fixed-price subcontract or purchase order involving more than the greater of (A) the simplified acquisition threshold, or (B) 5 percent of the estimated cost of the prime contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) So-called &ldquo;truth-in-negotiations&rdquo; provisions relating to cost or pricing data to be submitted by certain contractors and subcontractors are provided in section 2306a of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) The head of an agency may enter into contracts for periods of not more than five years for the following types of services (and items of supply related to such services) for which funds would otherwise be available for obligation only within the fiscal year for which appropriated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) operation, maintenance, and support of facilities and installations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) maintenance or modification of aircraft, ships, vehicles, and other highly complex military equipment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) specialized training necessitating high quality instructor skills (for example, pilot and aircrew members; foreign language training); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) base services (for example, ground maintenance; in-plane refueling; bus transportation; refuse collection and disposal);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">whenever he finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) there will be a continuing requirement for the services consonant with current plans for the proposed contract period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the furnishing of such services will require a substantial initial investment in plant or equipment, or the incurrence of substantial contingent liabilities for the assembly, training, or transportation of a specialized work force; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the use of such a contract will promote the best interests of the United States by encouraging effective competition and promoting economies in operation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In entering into such contracts, the head of the agency shall be guided by the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The portion of the cost of any plant or equipment amortized as a cost of contract performance should not exceed the ratio between the period of contract performance and the anticipated useful commercial life of such plant or equipment. Useful commercial life, for this purpose, means the commercial utility of the facilities rather than the physical life thereof, with due consideration given to such factors as location of facilities, specialized nature thereof, and obsolescence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Consideration shall be given to the desirability of obtaining an option to renew the contract for a reasonable period not to exceed three years, at prices not to include charges for plant, equipment and other nonrecurring costs, already amortized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Consideration shall be given to the desirability of reserving in the agency the right, upon payment of the unamortized portion of the cost of the plant or equipment, to take title thereto under appropriate circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the event funds are not made available for the continuation of such a contract into a subsequent fiscal year, the contract shall be canceled or terminated, and the costs of cancellation or termination may be paid from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) appropriations originally available for the performance of the contract concerned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) appropriations currently available for procurement of the type of services concerned, and not otherwise obligated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) funds appropriated for those payments.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Multiyear contracting authority is provided in section 2306b of this title.</p>

In any procurement of a commercial item conducted on a competitive basis and based upon adequate price competition, the head of the agency conducting the procurement shall not require cost or pricing data to be submitted under subsection (a) for the contract, subcontract, or modification of the contract or subcontract under the procurement. If additional information is necessary to determine the reasonableness of the price of the contract, subcontract, or modification, the head of the agency shall, to the maximum extent practicable, obtain the additional information from sources other than the offeror.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A contracting officer may require submission of cost or pricing data under subsection (a) only if the contracting officer makes a written determination that the agency is unable to obtain the information described in subparagraph (A)(ii).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Price Reductions for Defective Cost or Pricing Data</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) A prime contract (or <!-- PDFPage:676 -->change or modification to a prime contract) under which a certificate under subsection (a)(2) is required shall contain a provision that the price of the contract to the United States, including profit or fee, shall be adjusted to exclude any significant amount by which it may be determined by the head of the agency that such price was increased because the contractor (or any subcontractor required to make available such a certificate) submitted defective cost or pricing data.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the purposes of this section, defective cost or pricing data are cost or pricing data which, as of the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or another date agreed upon between the parties), were inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent. If for purposes of the preceding sentence the parties agree upon a date other than the date of agreement on the price of the contract, the date agreed upon by the parties shall be as close to the date of agreement on the price of the contract as is practicable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) It is not a defense to an adjustment of the price of a contract under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the price of the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current cost or pricing data had been submitted by the contractor or subcontractor because the contractor or subcontractor&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) otherwise was in a superior bargaining position with respect to the property or services procured;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the contracting officer should have known that the cost and pricing data in issue were defective even though the contractor or subcontractor took no affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention of the contracting officer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the contract was based on an agreement between the contractor and the United States about the total cost of the contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item procured under such contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the prime contractor or subcontractor did not submit a certification of cost and pricing data relating to the contract as required under subsection (a)(2).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) A contractor shall be allowed to offset an amount against the amount of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the contractor certifies to the contracting officer (or to a designated representative of the contracting officer) that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, the contractor is entitled to the offset; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the contractor proves that the cost or pricing data were available before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification) or, if applicable consistent with paragraph (1)(B), another date agreed upon between the parties, and that the data were not submitted as specified in subsection (a)(3) before such date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A contractor shall not be allowed to offset an amount otherwise authorized to be offset under subparagraph (A) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the certification under subsection (a)(2) with respect to the cost or pricing data involved was known to be false when signed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the United States proves that, had the cost or pricing data referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) been submitted to the United States before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification) or, if applicable consistent with paragraph (1)(B), another date agreed upon between the parties,,<sup><a href="#2306a_2_target" name="2306a_2">2</a></sup> the submission of such cost or pricing data would not have resulted in an increase in that price in the amount to be offset.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Interest and Penalties for Certain Overpayments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the United States makes an overpayment to a contractor under a contract subject to this section and the overpayment was due to the submission by the contractor of defective cost or pricing data, the contractor shall be liable to the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for interest on the amount of such overpayment, to be computed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for the period beginning on the date the overpayment was made to the contractor and ending on the date the contractor repays the amount of such overpayment to the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) at the current rate prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the submission of such defective data was a knowing submission, for an additional amount equal to the amount of the overpayment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any liability under this subsection of a contractor that submits cost or pricing data but refuses to submit the certification required by subsection (a)(2) with respect to the cost or pricing data shall not be affected by the refusal to submit such certification.</p>

Such information, at a minimum, shall include appropriate information on the prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price of the proposed contract or subcontract for the procurement.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To the extent that funds are otherwise available for obligation, the head of an agency may enter into multiyear contracts for the purchase of property whenever the head of that agency finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the use of such a contract will result in substantial savings of the total anticipated costs of carrying out the program through annual contracts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that the minimum need for the property to be purchased is expected to remain substantially unchanged during the contemplated contract period in terms of production rate, procurement rate, and total quantities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that there is a reasonable expectation that throughout the contemplated contract period the head of the agency will request funding for the contract at the level required to avoid contract cancellation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that there is a stable design for the property to be acquired and that the technical risks associated with such property are not excessive;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) that the estimates of both the cost of the contract and the anticipated cost avoidance through the use of a multiyear contract are realistic; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) in the case of a purchase by the Department of Defense, that the use of such a contract will promote the national security of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Each official named in paragraph (2) shall prescribe acquisition regulations for the agency or agencies under the jurisdiction of such official to promote the use of multiyear contracting as authorized by subsection (a) in a manner that will allow the most efficient use of multiyear contracting.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe the regulations applicable to the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe the regulations applicable to the Coast Guard, except that the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense shall apply to the Coast Guard when it is operating as a service in the Navy.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Contract Cancellations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The regulations may provide for cancellation provisions in multiyear contracts to the extent that such provisions are necessary and in the best interests of the United States. The cancellation provisions may include consideration of both recurring and nonrecurring costs of the contractor associated with the production of the items to be delivered under the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Participation by Subcontractors, Vendors, and Suppliers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In order to broaden the defense industrial base, the regulations shall provide that, to the extent practicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) multiyear contracting under paragraph (1) shall be used in such a manner as to seek, retain, and promote the use under such contracts of companies that are subcontractors, vendors, or suppliers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) upon accrual of any payment or other benefit under such a multiyear contract to any subcontractor, vendor, or supplier company participating in such contract, such payment or benefit shall be delivered to such company in the most expeditious manner practicable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Protection of Existing Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The regulations shall provide that, to the extent practicable, the administration of this section, and of the regulations prescribed under this section, shall not be carried out in a manner to preclude or curtail the existing ability of an agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide for competition in the production of items to be delivered under such a contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide for termination of a prime contract the performance of which is deficient with respect to cost, quality, or schedule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Cancellation or Termination for Insufficient Funding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the event funds are not made available for the continuation of a contract made under this section into a subsequent fiscal <!-- PDFPage:680 -->year, the contract shall be canceled or terminated. The costs of cancellation or termination may be paid from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) appropriations originally available for the performance of the contract concerned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) appropriations currently available for procurement of the type of property concerned, and not otherwise obligated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) funds appropriated for those payments.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Contract Cancellation Ceilings Exceeding</cap-smallcap> $100,000,000.&mdash;Before any contract described in subsection (a) that contains a clause setting forth a cancellation ceiling in excess of $100,000,000 may be awarded, the head of the agency concerned shall give written notification of the proposed contract and of the proposed cancellation ceiling for that contract to the Committees on Armed Services and on Appropriations of the Senate and House of Representatives, and such contract may not then be awarded until the end of a period of 30 days beginning on the date of such notification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Defense Acquisitions of Weapon Systems</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of the Department of Defense, the authority under subsection (a) includes authority to enter into the following multiyear contracts in accordance with this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A multiyear contract for the purchase of a weapon system, items and services associated with a weapon system, and logistics support for a weapon system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A multiyear contract for advance procurement of components, parts, and materials necessary to the manufacture of a weapon system, including a multiyear contract for such advance procurement that is entered into in order to achieve economic-lot purchases and more efficient production rates.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Defense Acquisitions Specifically Authorized by Law</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A multiyear contract may not be entered into for any fiscal year under this section for a defense acquisition program that has been specifically authorized by law to be carried out using multiyear contract authority unless each of the following conditions is satisfied:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary of Defense certifies to Congress that the current five-year defense program fully funds the support costs associated with the multiyear program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The proposed multiyear contract provides for production at not less than minimum economic rates given the existing tooling and facilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If for any fiscal year a multiyear contract to be entered into under this section is authorized by law for a particular procurement program and that authorization is subject to certain conditions established by law (including a condition as to cost savings to be achieved under the multiyear contract in comparison to specified other contracts) and if it appears (after negotiations with contractors) that such savings cannot be achieved, but that substantial savings could nevertheless be achieved through the use of a multiyear contract rather than specified other contracts, the President may submit to Congress a request for relief from the specified cost savings that must be achieved through multiyear contracting for that program. Any such request by the President shall include details about the request for a multiyear contract, including details about the negotiated contract terms and conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Defense Contract Options for Varying Quantities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense may instruct the Secretary of the military department concerned to incorporate into a proposed multiyear contract negotiated priced options for varying the quantities of end items to be procured over the period of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Inapplicability to Automatic Data Processing Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section does not apply to contracts for the purchase of property to which section 111 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 759) applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l) </em><cap-smallcap>Multiyear Contract Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For the purposes of this subsection, a multiyear contract is a contract for the purchase of property or services for more than one, but not more than five, program years. Such a contract may provide that performance under the contract during the second and subsequent years of the contract is contingent upon the appropriation of funds and (if it does so provide) may provide for a cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if such appropriations are not made.</p>

If the security is in the form of a lien in favor of the United States, such lien is paramount to all other liens and is effective immediately upon the first payment, without filing, notice, or other action by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Advance payments made under subsection (a) for commercial items may include payments, in a total amount of not more than 15 percent of the contract price, in advance of any performance of work under the contract.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of the Navy may advance to private salvage companies such funds as the Secretary considers necessary to provide for the immediate financing of salvage operations. Advances under this paragraph shall be made on terms that the Secretary considers adequate for the protection of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of the Navy shall provide, in each contract for construction or conversion of a naval vessel, that, when partial, progress, or other payments are made under such contract, the United States is secured by a lien upon work in progress and on property acquired for performance of the contract on account of all payments so made. The lien is paramount to all other liens.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Action in Case of Fraud</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In any case in which the remedy coordination official of an agency finds that there is substantial evidence that the request of a contractor for advance, partial, or progress payment under a contract awarded by that agency is based on fraud, the remedy coordination official shall recommend that the head of the agency reduce or suspend further payments to such contractor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an agency receiving a recommendation under paragraph (1) in the case of a contractor's request for payment under a contract shall determine whether there is substantial evidence that the request is based on fraud. Upon making such a determination, the agency head may reduce or suspend further payments to the contractor under such contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The extent of any reduction or suspension of payments by the head of an agency under paragraph (2) on the basis of fraud shall be reasonably commensurate with the anticipated loss to the United States resulting from the fraud.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A written justification for each decision of the head of an agency whether to reduce or suspend payments under paragraph (2) and for each recommendation received by such agency head in connection with such decision shall be prepared and be retained in the files of such agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The head of an agency shall prescribe procedures to ensure that, before such agency head decides to reduce or suspend payments in the case of a contractor under paragraph (2), the contractor is afforded notice of the proposed reduction or suspension and an opportunity to submit matters to the head of the agency in response to such proposed reduction or suspension.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Not later than 180 days after the date on which the head of an agency reduces or suspends payments to a contractor under paragraph (2), the remedy coordination official of such agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) review the determination of fraud on which the reduction or suspension is based; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) transmit a recommendation to the head of such agency whether the suspension or reduction should continue.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The head of an agency shall prepare for each year a report containing the recommendations made by the remedy coordination official of that agency to reduce or suspend payments under paragraph (2), the actions taken on the recommendations and the reasons for such actions, and an assessment of the effects of such actions on the Federal Government. The Secretary of each military department shall transmit the annual report of such department to the Secretary of Defense. Each such report shall be available to any member of Congress upon request.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:682 --><p class="statutory-body">(8) This subsection applies to the agencies named in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) of section 2303(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) The head of an agency may not delegate responsibilities under this subsection to any person in a position below level IV of the Executive Schedule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(10) In this subsection, the term &ldquo;remedy coordination official&rdquo;, with respect to an agency, means the person or entity in that agency who coordinates within that agency the administration of criminal, civil, administrative, and contractual remedies resulting from investigations of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section, the term &ldquo;qualification requirement&rdquo; means a requirement for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be completed by an offeror before award of a contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Except as provided in subsection (c), the head of the agency shall, before establishing a qualification requirement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prepare a written justification stating the necessity for establishing the qualification requirement and specify why the qualification requirement must be demonstrated before contract award;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) specify in writing and make available to a potential offeror upon request all requirements which a prospective offeror, or its product, must satisfy in order to become qualified, such requirements to be limited to those least restrictive to meet the purposes necessitating the establishment of the qualification requirement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) specify an estimate of the costs of testing and evaluation likely to be incurred by a potential offeror in order to become qualified;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) ensure that a potential offeror is provided, upon request and on a reimbursable basis, a prompt opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification using qualified personnel and facilities of the agency concerned or of another agency obtained through interagency agreement, or under contract, or other methods approved by the agency (including use of approved testing and evaluation services not provided under contract to the agency);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) if testing and evaluation services are provided under contract to the agency for the purposes of clause (4), provide to the extent possible that such services be provided by a contractor who is not expected to benefit from an absence of additional qualified sources and who shall be required in such contract to adhere to any restriction on technical data asserted by the potential offeror seeking qualification; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) ensure that a potential offeror seeking qualification is promptly informed as to whether qualification is attained and, in the event qualification is not attained, is promptly furnished specific information why qualification was not attained.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply with respect to a qualification requirement established by statute or administrative action before October 19, 1984, unless such requirement is a qualified products list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), if it is unreasonable to specify the standards for qualification which a prospective offeror or its product must satisfy, a determination to that effect shall be submitted to the advocate for competition of the procuring activity responsible for the purchase of the item subject to the qualification requirement. After considering any comments of the advocate for competition reviewing such determination, the head of the purchasing office may waive the requirements of clauses (2) through (6) of subsection (b) for up to two years with respect to the item subject to the qualification requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The waiver authority provided in this paragraph does not apply with respect to a qualified products list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A potential offeror may not be denied the opportunity to submit and have considered an offer for a contract solely because the potential offeror (A) is not on a qualified bidders list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified products list, or (B) has not been identified as meeting a qualification requirement established after October 19, 1984, if the potential offeror can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the contracting officer that the potential offeror or its product meets the standards established for qualification or can meet such standards before the date specified for award of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing contained in this subsection requires the referral of an offer to the Small Business Administration pursuant to section 8(b)(7) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(b)(7)) if the basis for the referral is a challenge by the offeror to either the validity of the qualification requirement or the offeror's compliance with such requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The head of an agency need not delay a proposed procurement in order to comply with subsection (b) or in order to provide a potential offeror with an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The requirements of subsection (b) also apply before enforcement of any qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) If the number of qualified sources or qualified products available to compete actively for an anticipated future requirement is fewer than two actual manufacturers or the products of two actual manufacturers, respectively, the head of the agency concerned shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) periodically publish notice in the Commerce Business Daily soliciting additional sources or products to seek qualification, unless the contracting officer determines that such publication would compromise national security; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) bear the cost of conducting the specified testing and evaluation (excluding the costs associated with producing the item or establishing the production, quality control, or other system to be tested and evaluated) for a small business concern or a product manufactured by a small business concern which has met the standards specified for qualification and which could reasonably be expected to compete for a contract for that requirement, but such costs may be borne only if the head of the agency determines that such additional qualified sources or products are likely to result in cost savings from increased competition for future requirements sufficient to amortize the costs incurred by the agency within a reasonable period of time considering the duration and dollar value of anticipated future requirements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an agency shall require a prospective contractor requesting the United States to bear testing and evaluation costs under paragraph (1)(B) to certify as to its status as a small business concern under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Within seven years after the establishment of a qualification requirement under subsection <!-- PDFPage:690 -->(b) or within seven years following an agency's enforcement of a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list, any such qualification requirement shall be examined and revalidated in accordance with the requirements of subsection (b). The preceding sentence does not apply in the case of a qualification requirement for which a waiver is in effect under subsection (c)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Except in an emergency as determined by the head of the agency, whenever the head of the agency determines not to enforce a qualification requirement for a solicitation, the agency may not thereafter enforce that qualification requirement unless the agency complies with the requirements of subsection (b).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2320. Rights in technical data</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to define the legitimate interest of the United States and of a contractor or subcontractor in technical data pertaining to an item or process. Such regulations shall be included in regulations of the Department of Defense prescribed as part of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Such regulations may not impair any right of the United States or of any contractor or subcontractor with respect to patents or copyrights or any other right in technical data otherwise established by law. Such regulations also may not impair the right of a contractor or subcontractor to receive from a third party a fee or royalty for the use of technical data pertaining to an item or process developed exclusively at private expense by the contractor or subcontractor, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such regulations shall include the following provisions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the case of an item or process that is developed by a contractor or subcontractor exclusively with Federal funds (other than an item or process developed under a contract or subcontract to which regulations under section 9(j)(2) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638(j)(2)) apply), the United States shall have the unlimited right to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) use technical data pertaining to the item or process; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) release or disclose the technical data to persons outside the government or permit the use of the technical data by such persons.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Except as provided in subparagraphs (C) and (D), in the case of an item or process that is developed by a contractor or subcontractor exclusively at private expense, the contractor or subcontractor may restrict the right of the United States to release or disclose technical data pertaining to the item or process to persons outside the government or permit the use of the technical data by such persons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Subparagraph (B) does not apply to technical data that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) constitutes a correction or change to data furnished by the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) relates to form, fit, or function;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) is necessary for operation, maintenance, installation, or training (other than detailed manufacturing or process data); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) is otherwise publicly available or has been released or disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor without restriction on further release or disclosure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Notwithstanding subparagraph (B), the United States may release or disclose technical data to persons outside the Government, or permit the use of technical data by such persons, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such release, disclosure, or use&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) is necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) is a release or disclosure of technical data (other than detailed manufacturing or process data) to, or use of such data by, a foreign government that is in the interest of the United States and is required for evaluational or informational purposes;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such release, disclosure, or use is made subject to a prohibition that the person to whom the data is released or disclosed may not further release, disclose, or use such data; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is notified of such release, disclosure, or use.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) In the case of an item or process that is developed in part with Federal funds and in part at private expense, the respective rights of the United States and of the contractor or subcontractor in technical data pertaining to such item or process shall be established as early in the acquisition process as practicable (preferably during contract negotiations) and shall be based upon negotiations between the United States and the contractor, except in any case in which the Secretary of Defense determines, on the basis of criteria established in the regulations, that negotiations would not be practicable. The establishment of such rights shall be based upon consideration of all of the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The statement of congressional policy and objectives in section 200 of title 35, the statement of purposes in section 2(b) of the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 (15 U.S.C. 638 note), and the declaration of policy in section 2 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:691 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The interest of the United States in increasing competition and lowering costs by developing and locating alternative sources of supply and manufacture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The interest of the United States in encouraging contractors to develop at private expense items for use by the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) Such other factors as the Secretary of Defense may prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) A contractor or subcontractor (or a prospective contractor or subcontractor) may not be required, as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for the award of a contract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to sell or otherwise relinquish to the United States any rights in technical data except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) rights in technical data described in subparagraph (C); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) under the conditions described in subparagraph (D); or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to refrain from offering to use, or from using, an item or process to which the contractor is entitled to restrict rights in data under subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) The Secretary of Defense may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) negotiate and enter into a contract with a contractor or subcontractor for the acquisition of rights in technical data not otherwise provided under subparagraph (C) or (D), if necessary to develop alternative sources of supply and manufacture;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) agree to restrict rights in technical data otherwise accorded to the United States under this section if the United States receives a royalty-free license to use, release, or disclose the data for purposes of the United States (including purposes of competitive procurement); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) permit a contractor or subcontractor to license directly to a third party the use of technical data which the contractor is otherwise allowed to restrict, if necessary to develop alternative sources of supply and manufacture.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Defense shall define the terms &ldquo;developed&rdquo;, &ldquo;exclusively with Federal funds&rdquo;, and &ldquo;exclusively at private expense&rdquo; in regulations prescribed under paragraph (1). In defining such terms, the Secretary shall specify the manner in which indirect costs shall be treated and shall specify that amounts spent for independent research and development and bid and proposal costs shall not be considered to be Federal funds for the purposes of definitions under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Regulations prescribed under subsection (a) shall require that, whenever practicable, a contract for supplies or services entered into by an agency named in section 2303 of this title contain appropriate provisions relating to technical data, including provisions&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) defining the respective rights of the United States and the contractor or subcontractor (at any tier) regarding any technical data to be delivered under the contract and providing that, in the case of a contract for a commercial item, the item shall be presumed to be developed at private expense unless shown otherwise in accordance with section 2321(f);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) specifying the technical data, if any, to be delivered under the contract and delivery schedules for such delivery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) establishing or referencing procedures for determining the acceptability of technical data to be delivered under the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) establishing separate contract line items for the technical data, if any, to be delivered under the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to the maximum practicable extent, identifying, in advance of delivery, technical data which is to be delivered with restrictions on the right of the United States to use such data;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) requiring the contractor to revise any technical data delivered under the contract to reflect engineering design changes made during the performance of the contract and affecting the form, fit, and function of the items specified in the contract and to deliver such revised technical data to an agency within a time specified in the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) requiring the contractor to furnish written assurance at the time the technical data is delivered or is made available that the technical data is complete and accurate and satisfies the requirements of the contract concerning technical data;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) establishing remedies to be available to the United States when technical data required to be delivered or made available under the contract is found to be incomplete or inadequate or to not satisfy the requirements of the contract concerning technical data; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) authorizing the head of the agency to withhold payments under the contract (or exercise such other remedies as the head of the agency considers appropriate) during any period if the contractor does not meet the requirements of the contract pertaining to the delivery of technical data.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Nothing in this section or in section 2305(d) of this title prohibits the Secretary of Defense from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prescribing standards for determining whether a contract entered into by the Department of Defense shall provide for a time to be specified in the contract after which the United States shall have the right to use (or have used) for any purpose of the United States all technical data required to be delivered to the United States under the contract or providing for such a period of time (not to exceed 7 years) as a negotiation objective; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) prescribing reasonable and flexible guidelines, including negotiation objectives, for the conduct of negotiations regarding the respective rights in technical data of the United States and the contractor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary of Defense shall by regulation establish programs which provide domestic business concerns an opportunity to purchase or borrow replenishment parts from the United States for the purpose of design replication or modification, to be used by such concerns in the submission of subsequent offers to sell the same or like parts to the United States. Nothing in <!-- PDFPage:692 -->this subsection limits the authority of the head of an agency to impose restrictions on such a program related to national security considerations, inventory needs of the United States, the improbability of future purchases of the same or like parts, or any additional restriction otherwise required by law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Contracts Covered by Section</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section applies to any contract for supplies or services entered into by the Department of Defense that includes provisions for the delivery of technical data.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Contractor Justification for Restrictions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contract subject to this section shall provide that a contractor under the contract and any subcontractor under the contract at any tier shall be prepared to furnish to the contracting officer a written justification for any use or release restriction (as defined in subsection (i)) asserted by the contractor or subcontractor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Review of Restrictions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that there is a thorough review of the appropriateness of any use or release restriction asserted with respect to technical data by a contractor or subcontractor at any tier under a contract subject to this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The review of an asserted use or release restriction under paragraph (1) shall be conducted <!-- PDFPage:694 -->before the end of the three-year period beginning on the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date on which final payment is made on the contract under which the technical data is required to be delivered; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the date on which the technical data is delivered under the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Challenges to Restrictions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense may challenge a use or release restriction asserted with respect to technical data by a contractor or subcontractor at any tier under a contract subject to this section if the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reasonable grounds exist to question the current validity of the asserted restriction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the continued adherence by the United States to the asserted restriction would make it impracticable to procure the item to which the technical data pertain competitively at a later time.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A challenge to an asserted use or release restriction may not be made under paragraph (1) after the end of the three-year period described in subparagraph (B) unless the technical data involved&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) are publicly available;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) have been furnished to the United States without restriction; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) have been otherwise made available without restriction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The three-year period referred to in subparagraph (A) is the three-year period beginning on the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the date on which final payment is made on the contract under which the technical data are required to be delivered; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the date on which the technical data are delivered under the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Secretary challenges an asserted use or release restriction under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall provide written notice of the challenge to the contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction. Any such notice shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) state the specific grounds for challenging the asserted restriction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) require a response within 60 days justifying the current validity of the asserted restriction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) state that evidence of a justification described in paragraph (4) may be submitted.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) It is a justification of an asserted use or release restriction challenged under paragraph (1) that, within the three-year period preceding the challenge to the restriction, the Department of Defense validated a restriction identical to the asserted restriction if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such validation occurred after a challenge to the validated restriction under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the validated restriction was asserted by the same contractor or subcontractor (or a licensee of such contractor or subcontractor).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Time for Contractors to Submit Justifications</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a contractor or subcontractor asserting a use or release restriction submits to the contracting officer a written request, showing the need for additional time to comply with the requirement to justify the current validity of the asserted restriction, additional time to adequately permit the submission of such justification shall be provided by the contracting officer as appropriate. If a party asserting a restriction receives notices of challenges to restrictions on technical data from more than one contracting officer, and notifies each contracting officer of the existence of more than one challenge, the contracting officer initiating the first in time challenge, after consultation with the party asserting the restriction and the other contracting officers, shall formulate a schedule of responses to each of the challenges that will afford the party asserting the restriction with an equitable opportunity to respond to each such challenge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Presumption of Development Exclusively at Private Expense for Commercial Items Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of a challenge to a use or release restriction that is asserted with respect to technical data of a contractor or subcontractor under a contract for commercial items, the contracting officer shall presume that the contractor or subcontractor has justified the restriction on the basis that the item was developed exclusively at private expense, whether or not the contractor or subcontractor submits a justification in response to the notice provided pursuant to subsection (d)(3). In such a case, the challenge to the use or release restriction may be sustained only if information provided by the Department of Defense demonstrates that the item was not developed exclusively at private expense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Decision by Contracting Officer</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Upon a failure by the contractor or subcontractor to submit any response under subsection (d)(3), the contracting officer shall issue a decision pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After review of any justification submitted in response to the notice provided pursuant to subsection (d)(3), the contracting officer shall, within 60 days of receipt of any justification submitted, issue a decision or notify the party asserting the restriction of the time within which a decision will be issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Claims</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a claim pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction is submitted in writing to a contracting officer by a contractor or subcontractor at any tier, such claim shall be considered a claim within the meaning of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Rights and Liability Upon Final Disposition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If, upon final disposition, the contracting officer's challenge to the use or release restriction is sustained&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the restriction shall be cancelled; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the asserted restriction is found not to be substantially justified, the contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction shall be liable to the United States for payment of the cost to the United States of reviewing the asserted restriction and the fees and other expenses (as defined in section 2412(d)(2)(A) of title 28) incurred by the United States in challenging the asserted restriction, unless special circumstances would make such payment unjust.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:695 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) If, upon final disposition, the contracting officer's challenge to the use or release restriction is not sustained&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the United States shall continue to be bound by the restriction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the United States shall be liable for payment to the party asserting the restriction for fees and other expenses (as defined in section 2412(d)(2)(A) of title 28) incurred by the party asserting the restriction in defending the asserted restriction if the challenge by the United States is found not to be made in good faith.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Use or Release Restriction Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;use or release restriction&rdquo;, with respect to technical data delivered to the United States under a contract subject to this section, means a restriction by the contractor or subcontractor on the right of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to use such technical data; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to release or disclose such technical data to persons outside the Government or permit the use of such technical data by persons outside the Government.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Federal Acquisition Regulation (issued under section 25(c) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 421(c))&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2323_1_target" name="2323_1">1</a></sup> shall provide procedures or guidelines for contracting officers to set goals which agency prime contractors that are required to submit subcontracting plans under section 8(d)(4)(B) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(B)) in furtherance of the agency's program to meet the 5 percent goal specified in paragraph (1) should meet in awarding subcontracts, including subcontracts to minority-owned media, to entities described in that paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the Secretary notifies Congress of such determination and the reasons for such determination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Competitive Procedures and Advance Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To attain the goal of subsection (a):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) The head of the agency shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) exercise his utmost authority, resourcefulness, and diligence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) in the case of the Department of Defense, actively monitor and assess the progress of the military departments, Defense Agencies, and prime contractors of the Department of Defense in attaining such goal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) in the case of the Coast Guard and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, actively monitor and assess the progress of the prime contractors of the agency in attaining such goal.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To the extent practicable and when necessary to facilitate achievement of the 5 percent goal described in subsection (a), the head of an agency shall make advance payments under section 2307 of this title to contractors described in subsection (a). The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide guidance to contracting officers for making advance payments to entities described in subsection (a)(1) under such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To the extent practicable and when necessary to facilitate achievement of the 5 percent goal described in subsection (a), the head of an agency may enter into contracts using less than full and open competitive procedures (including awards under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act) and partial set asides for entities described in subsection (a)(1), but shall pay a price not exceeding fair market cost by more than 10 percent in payment per contract to contractors or subcontractors described in subsection (a). The head of an agen<!-- PDFPage:698 -->cy shall adjust the percentage specified in the preceding sentence for any industry category if available information clearly indicates that nondisadvantaged small business concerns in such industry category are generally being denied a reasonable opportunity to compete for contracts because of the use of that percentage in the application of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To the extent practicable, the head of an agency shall maximize the number of minority small business concerns, historically Black colleges and universities, and minority institutions participating in the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Each head of an agency shall prescribe regulations which provide for the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Procedures or guidance for contracting officers to provide incentives for prime contractors referred to in subsection (a)(3) to increase subcontractor awards to entities described in subsection (a)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A requirement that contracting officers emphasize the award of contracts to entities described in subsection (a)(1) in all industry categories, including those categories in which such entities have not traditionally dominated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Guidance to agency personnel on the relationship among the following programs:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The program implementing this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) The program established under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) The small business set-aside program established under section 15(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(a)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) With respect to an agency procurement which is reasonably likely to be set aside for entities described in subsection (a)(1), a requirement that (to the maximum extent practicable) the procurement be designated as such a set-aside before the solicitation for the procurement is issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Policies and procedures which, to the maximum extent practicable, will ensure that current levels in the number or dollar value of contracts awarded under the program established under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)) and under the small business set-aside program established under section 15(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(a)) are maintained and that every effort is made to provide new opportunities for contract awards to eligible entities, in order to meet the goal of subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Implementation of this section in a manner which will not alter the procurement process under the program established under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) A requirement that one factor used in evaluating the performance of a contracting officer be the ability of the officer to increase contract awards to entities described in subsection (a)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) Increased technical assistance to entities described in subsection (a)(1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Penalties and Regulations Relating to Status</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Whoever for the purpose of securing a contract or subcontract under subsection (a) misrepresents the status of any concern or person as a small business concern owned and controlled by a minority (as described in subsection (a)), shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than one year, or a fine under title 18, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall prohibit awarding a contract under this section to an entity described in subsection (a)(1) unless the entity agrees to comply with the requirements of section 15(<em>o</em>)(1) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(<em>o</em>)(1)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Industry Categories</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the head of the agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ensure that no particular industry category bears a disproportionate share of the contracts awarded to attain the goal established by subsection (a); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) ensure that contracts awarded to attain the goal established by subsection (a) are made across the broadest possible range of industry categories.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under procedures prescribed by the head of the agency, a person may request the Secretary to determine whether the use of small disadvantaged business set asides by a contracting activity of the agency has caused a particular industry category to bear a disproportionate share of the contracts awarded to attain the goal established for that contracting activity for the purposes of this section. Upon making a determination that a particular industry category is bearing a disproportionate share, the head of the agency shall take appropriate actions to limit the contracting activity's use of set asides in awarding contracts in that particular industry category.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Compliance With Subcontracting Plan Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall contain regulations to ensure that potential contractors submitting sealed bids or competitive proposals to the agency for procurement contracts to be awarded under the program provided for by this section are complying with applicable subcontracting plan requirements of section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The regulations required by paragraph (1) shall ensure that, with respect to a sealed bid or competitive proposal for which the bidder or offeror is required to negotiate or submit a subcontracting plan under section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)), the subcontracting plan shall be a factor in evaluating the bid or proposal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Annual Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than December 15 of each year, the head of the agency shall submit to Congress a report on the progress of the agency toward attaining the goal of subsection (a) during the preceding fiscal year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A plan to achieve the goal, if necessary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The report required under paragraph (1) shall also include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The aggregate differential between the fair market price of all contracts awarded pur<!-- PDFPage:699 -->suant to subsection (e)(3) and the estimated fair market price of all such contracts had such contracts been entered into using full and open competitive procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) An analysis of the impact that subsection (a) shall have on the ability of small business concerns not owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to compete for contracts with the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A description of the percentage of contracts (actions), the total dollar amount (size of action), and the number of different entities relative to the attainment of the goal of subsection (a), separately for Black Americans, Native Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, and other minorities.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Indirect Cost That Violates a FAR Cost Principle</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The head of an agency shall require that a covered contract provide that if the contractor submits to the agency a proposal for settlement of indirect costs incurred by the contractor for any period after such costs have been accrued and if that proposal includes the submission of a cost which is unallowable because the cost violates a cost principle in the Federal Acquisition Regulation or applicable agency supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the cost shall be disallowed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Penalty for Violation of Cost Principle</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the head of the agency determines that a cost submitted by a contractor in its proposal for settlement is expressly unallowable under a cost principle referred to in subsection (a) that defines the allowability of specific selected costs, the head of the agency shall assess a penalty against the contractor in an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the amount of the disallowed cost allocated to covered contracts for which a proposal for settlement of indirect costs has been submitted; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) interest (to be computed based on provisions in the Federal Acquisition Regulation) to compensate the United States for the use of any funds which a contractor has been paid in excess of the amount to which the contractor was entitled.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Waiver of Penalty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide for a penalty under subsection (b) to be waived in the case of a contractor's proposal for settlement of indirect costs when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the contractor withdraws the proposal before the formal initiation of an audit of the proposal by the Federal Government and resubmits a revised proposal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of unallowable costs subject to the penalty is insignificant; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the contractor demonstrates, to the contracting officer's satisfaction, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) it has established appropriate policies and personnel training and an internal control and review system that provide assurances that unallowable costs subject to penalties are precluded from being included in the contractor's proposal for settlement of indirect costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the unallowable costs subject to the penalty were inadvertently incorporated into the proposal.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Applicability of Contract Disputes Procedure to Disallowance of Cost and Assessment of Penalty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An action of the head of an agency under subsection (a) or (b)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(N) Costs of severance pay paid by the contractor to a foreign national employed by the contractor under a service contract performed in a foreign country if the termination of the employment of the foreign national is the result of the closing of, or the curtailment of activities at, a United States military facility in that country at the request of the government of that country.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) In subparagraph (A):</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to a contract with a financial institution that is owned or controlled by citizens or nationals of a foreign country, as determined by the Secretary of Defense awarding the contract.<sup><a href="#2324_1_target" name="2324_1">1</a></sup> Such a determination shall be made in accordance with the criteria set out in paragraph (1) of section 4(g) of title III of the Act of March 3, 1933 (41 U.S.C. 10b&ndash;1) (commonly referred to as the Buy American Act) and the policy guidance referred to in paragraph (2)(A) of that section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The head of an agency shall include in the solicitation for a covered contract a statement indicating&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) that a waiver has been granted under subparagraph (A) for the contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) whether the head of the agency will consider granting such a waiver, and, if the agency head will consider granting a waiver, the criteria to be used in granting the waiver.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The head of an agency shall make the final determination regarding whether to grant a waiver under subparagraph (A) with respect to a covered contract before award of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation implementing this section may establish appropriate definitions, exclusions, limitations, and qualifications.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Required Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall contain provisions on the allowability of contractor costs.

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (e)(1)(L) is based on section 2399 of this title as enacted by Pub. L. 97&ndash;295, &sect;1(29)(A), Oct. 12, 1982, 96 Stat. 1293.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 1(f)(2) of the bill would transfer the provisions of existing 10 U.S.C. 2399 to a new subparagraph (L) of 10 U.S.C. 2324(e)(1). The existing section 2399 prohibits the use of appropriated funds to reimburse a defense contractor for insurance against the contractor's costs of correcting defects in the contractor's materials or workmanship. The transfer would add the provision to the list of contractor costs which are not allowable as expenses which may be paid by the Department of Defense under a contract. This allowable cost limitation applies only to contracts for more than $100,000 other than fixed price contracts without cost incentives (see 10 US.C. 2324(k)). The committee determined that it is appropriate to treat the subject matter of section 2399 in the same manner as other provisions relating to allowable costs of defense contractors and notes that section 2324, providing a more comprehensive treatment of allowable costs, was enacted after section 2399. The committee recognizes that contracts for amounts less than $100,000 and fixed price contracts without cost incentives are covered by the existing section 2399 and would not be covered by the provision as transferred. The committee determined that in practice the existing section 2399 would not have significant applicability to such contracts and that the transfer is appropriate as part of this bill.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Logistics support, supplies, and services may be acquired or transferred by the United States under the authority of this subchapter on a reimbursement basis or by replacement-in-kind or exchange of supplies or services of an equal value.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In entering into agreements with the Government of another North Atlantic Treaty Organization country or other foreign country for the acquisition or transfer of logistic support, supplies, and services on a reimbursement basis, the Secretary of Defense shall negotiate for adoption of the following pricing principles for reciprocal application:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The price charged by a supplying country for logistics support, supplies, and services specifically procured by the supplying country from its contractors for a recipient country shall be no less favorable than the price for identical items or services charged by such contractors to the armed forces of the supplying country, taking into account price differentials due to delivery schedules, points of delivery, and other similar considerations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The price charged a recipient country for supplies furnished by a supplying country from its inventory, and the price charged a recipient country for logistics support and services furnished by the officers, employees, or governmental agencies of a supplying country, shall be the same as the price charged for identical supplies, support, or services acquired by an armed force of the supplying country from such governmental sources.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To the extent that the Secretary of Defense is unable to obtain mutual acceptance by the other country involved of the reciprocal pricing principles for reimbursable transactions set forth in paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the United States may not acquire from such country any logistic support, supply, or service not governed by such reciprocal pricing principles unless the United States forces <!-- PDFPage:717 -->commander acquiring such support, supply, or service determines (after price analysis) that the price thereof is fair and reasonable; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) transfers by the United States to such country under this subchapter of any logistic support, supply, or service that is not governed by such reciprocal pricing principles shall be subject to the pricing provisions of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) To the extent that indirect costs (including charges for plant and production equipment), administrative surcharges, and contract administration costs with respect to any North Atlantic Treaty Organization country or other foreign country are not waived by operation of the reciprocal pricing principles of paragraph (1), the Secretary of Defense may, on a reciprocal basis, agree to waive such costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The pricing principles set forth in paragraph (2) and the waiver authority provided in paragraph (3) shall also apply to agreements with North Atlantic Treaty Organization subsidiary bodies and the United Nations Organization or any regional international organization of which the United States is a member under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In acquiring or transferring logistics support, supplies, or services under the authority of this subchapter by exchange of supplies or services, the Secretary of Defense may not agree to or carry out the following:</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a covered system may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production until realistic survivability testing of the system is completed in accordance with this section and the report required by subsection (d) with respect to that testing is submitted in accordance with that subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a major munition program or a missile program may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production until realistic lethality testing of the program is completed in accordance with this section and the report required by subsection (d) with respect to that testing is submitted in accordance with that subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall provide that a covered product improvement program may not proceed beyond low-rate initial production until&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:738 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a product improvement to a covered system, realistic survivability testing is completed in accordance with this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a product improvement to a major munitions program or a missile program, realistic lethality testing is completed in accordance with this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Test Guidelines</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Survivability and lethality tests required under subsection (a) shall be carried out sufficiently early in the development phase of the system or program (including a covered product improvement program) to allow any design deficiency demonstrated by the testing to be corrected in the design of the system, munition, or missile (or in the product modification or upgrade to the system, munition, or missile) before proceeding beyond low-rate initial production.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The costs of all tests required under that subsection shall be paid from funds available for the system being tested.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Waiver Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense may waive the application of the survivability and lethality tests of this section to a covered system, munitions program, missile program, or covered product improvement program if the Secretary, before the system or program enters engineering and manufacturing development, certifies to Congress that live-fire testing of such system or program would be unreasonably expensive and impractical.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a covered system (or covered product improvement program for a covered system), the Secretary may waive the application of the survivability and lethality tests of this section to such system or program and instead allow testing of the system or program in combat by firing munitions likely to be encountered in combat at components, subsystems, and subassemblies, together with performing design analyses, modeling and simulation, and analysis of combat data. Such alternative testing may not be carried out in the case of any covered system (or covered product improvement program for a covered system) unless the Secretary certifies to Congress, before the system or program enters engineering and manufacturing development, that the survivability and lethality testing of such system or program otherwise required by this section would be unreasonably expensive and impracticable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall include with any certification under paragraph (1) or (2) a report explaining how the Secretary plans to evaluate the survivability or the lethality of the system or program and assessing possible alternatives to realistic survivability testing of the system or program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In time of war or mobilization, the President may suspend the operation of any provision of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Reporting to Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At the conclusion of survivability or lethality testing under subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense shall submit a report on the testing to the Committees on Armed Services and on Appropriations of the Senate and House of Representatives. Each such report shall describe the results of the survivability or lethality testing and shall give the Secretary's overall assessment of the testing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;covered system&rdquo; means a vehicle, weapon platform, or conventional weapon system&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that includes features designed to provide some degree of protection to users in combat; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that is a major system within the meaning of that term in section 2302(5) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;major munitions program&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a munition program for which more than 1,000,000 rounds are planned to be acquired; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a conventional munitions program that is a major system within the meaning of that term in section 2302(5) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;realistic survivability testing&rdquo; means, in the case of a covered system (or a covered product improvement program for a covered system), testing for vulnerability of the system in combat by firing munitions likely to be encountered in combat (or munitions with a capability similar to such munitions) at the system configured for combat, with the primary emphasis on testing vulnerability with respect to potential user casualties and taking into equal consideration the susceptibility to attack and combat performance of the system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The term &ldquo;realistic lethality testing&rdquo; means, in the case of a major munitions program or a missile program (or a covered product improvement program for such a program), testing for lethality by firing the munition or missile concerned at appropriate targets configured for combat.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The term &ldquo;configured for combat&rdquo;, with respect to a weapon system, platform, or vehicle, means loaded or equipped with all dangerous materials (including all flammables and explosives) that would normally be on board in combat.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The term &ldquo;covered product improvement program&rdquo; means a program under which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a modification or upgrade will be made to a covered system which (as determined by the Secretary of Defense) is likely to affect significantly the survivability of such system; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a modification or upgrade will be made to a major munitions program or a missile program which (as determined by the Secretary of Defense) is likely to affect significantly the lethality of the munition or missile produced under the program.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Reuse Studies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the military department concerned publicly announces that a military installation is a candidate for closure or that a final decision has been made to close a military installation and the Secretary of Defense determines, because of the location, facilities, or other particular characteristics of the installation, that the installation may be suitable for some specific Federal, State, or local use potentially beneficial to the Nation, the Secretary of Defense may conduct such studies, including the preparation of an environmental impact statement in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), in connection with such installation and such potential use as may be necessary to provide information sufficient to make sound conclusions and recommendations regarding the possible use of the installation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Adjustment and Diversification Assistance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense may make grants, conclude cooperative agreements, and supplement funds available under Federal programs administered by agencies other than the Department of Defense in order to assist State and local governments in planning community adjustments and economic diversification required (A) by the proposed or actual establishment, realignment, or closure of a military installation, (B) by the cancellation or termination of a Department of Defense contract or the failure to proceed with an approved major weapon system program, (C) by a publicly announced planned major reduction in Department of Defense spending that would directly and adversely affect a community, (D) by the encroachment of a civilian community on a military installation, or (E) by the closure or the significantly reduced operations of a defense facility as the result of the merger, acquisition, or consolidation of the defense contractor operating the defense facility, if the Secretary determines that an action described in clause (A), (B), (C), or (E) is likely to have a direct and significantly adverse consequence on the affected community or, in the case of an action described in clause (D), if the Secretary determines that the encroachment of the civilian community is likely to impair the continued operational utility of the military installation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of the establishment or expansion of a military installation, assistance may be made under paragraph (1) only if (A) community impact assistance or special impact assistance is not otherwise available, and (B) the establishment or expansion involves the assignment to the installation of (i) more than 2,000 military, civilian, and contractor Department of Defense personnel, or (ii) more military, civilian, and contractor Department of Defense personnel than the number equal to 10 percent of the number of persons employed in counties or independent municipalities within fifteen miles of the installation, whichever is lesser.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of a publicly announced planned reduction in Department of Defense spending, the closure or significantly reduced operations <!-- PDFPage:753 -->of a defense facility, the cancellation or termination of a Department of Defense contract, or the failure to proceed with a previously approved major defense acquisition program, assistance may be made under paragraph (1) only if the reduction, cancellation, termination, or failure will have a direct and significant adverse impact on a community and will result in the loss of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall establish criteria for the selection of community adjustment and economic diversification programs to receive assistance under subparagraph (A). Such criteria shall include a requirement that the State or local government agree&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary of Defense may also make grants, conclude cooperative agreements, and supplement other Federal funds in order to assist a State or local government in planning community adjustments and economic diversification even though the State or local government is not currently eligible for assistance under paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines that a substantial portion of the economic activity or population of the geographic area to be subject to the advance planning is dependent on defense expenditures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Funds provided to State and local governments and regional organizations under this section may be used as part or all of any required non-Federal contribution to a Federal grant-in-aid program for the purposes stated in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) To the extent practicable, the Secretary of Defense shall inform a State or local government applying for assistance under this subsection of the approval or rejection by the Secretary of the application for such assistance as follows:</p>

<p class="note-body">In the section, the words &ldquo;services, supplies, or both&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;services and materials&rdquo; because &ldquo;supplies&rdquo; is defined in 10:101(26) to include material. However, the word &ldquo;construction&rdquo; is retained and used with &ldquo;services, supplies, or both&rdquo; to allow the definition of &ldquo;services and materials&rdquo; in 50:1436(a)(4) to be omitted. The text of 50:1436(b) (words before (1)) is omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the definition of &ldquo;Department of Defense&rdquo; in 50:1436(a)(5) is omitted because of 10:101(5). The text of 50:1436(h) is omitted as executed. The text of 50:1436(a)(7) is omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2), the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;individual, firm, corporation, partnership, association, or other legal entity&rdquo; because of 1:1.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(3), the source provisions are restated to include the conduct described therein within the definition of &ldquo;served&rdquo; when used with &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo;. Although 50:1436(b)(1)(A)&ndash;(C) appear to be co-equal clauses, the use in other parts of the source provision only of the language used in clause (A), coupled with the legislative history of the source provision, indicates that clauses (B) and (C) are only descriptions of conduct that is within the scope of clause (A) as service &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; than that described in that clause.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the word &ldquo;commissioned&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary because of 10:101(14). The words &ldquo;Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Armed Forces of the United States&rdquo; for clarity. In ordinary context, &ldquo;Armed Forces of the United States&rdquo; would include the Coast Guard (10:101(4)). However, the context of 50:1436 indicates that the term was not intended to include the Coast Guard; the section elsewhere refers only to the Department of Defense, not to the Department of Transportation under which the Coast Guard is located. The words &ldquo;civilian official&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;civilian officer&rdquo; to use the more appropriate terminology.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the text of 50:1436(e) (less words before semicolon) is omitted as covered by the words &ldquo;holds .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at any time during a fiscal year&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the word &ldquo;Congress&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives&rdquo; for consistency in title 10 and with other titles of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f), the words &ldquo;shall be guilty of a misdemeanor&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of 18:1. The words &ldquo;upon conviction thereof&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In this subsection, the term &ldquo;major defense acquisition program&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a conventional weapons system that is a major system within the meaning of that term in section 2302(5) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is designed for use in combat.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Operational Test and Evaluation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Operational testing of a major defense acquisition program may not be conducted until the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation of the Department of Defense approves (in writing) the adequacy of the plans (including the projected level of funding) for operational test and evaluation to be conducted in connection with that program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Director shall analyze the results of the operational test and evaluation conducted for each major defense acquisition program. At the conclusion of such testing, the Director shall prepare a report stating the opinion of the Director as to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) A final decision within the Department of Defense to proceed with a major defense acquisition program beyond low-rate initial production may not be made until the Director has submitted to the Secretary of Defense the report with respect to that program under paragraph (2) and the congressional defense committees have received that report.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Director may waive the limitation under paragraph (1) in any case if the Director determines in writing that sufficient steps have been taken to ensure the impartiality of the contractor in providing the services.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) when the milestone II decision with respect to that system is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) by the official of the Department of Defense who makes that decision.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In this section, the term &ldquo;milestone II decision&rdquo; means the decision to approve the engineering and manufacturing development of a major system by the official of the Department of Defense designated to have the authority to make that decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any increase from a quantity determined under paragraph (1) may only be made with the approval of the official making the determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The quantity of articles of a major system that may be procured for low-rate initial production may not be less than one operationally configured production unit unless another quantity is established at the milestone II decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary of Defense shall include a statement of the quantity determined under paragraph (1) in the first SAR submitted with respect to the program concerned after that quantity is determined. If the quantity exceeds 10 percent of the total number of articles to be <!-- PDFPage:772 -->produced, as determined at the milestone II decision with respect to that system, the Secretary shall include in the statement the reasons for such quantity.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of a military department may make a contract that is an agreement to lease or charter or an agreement to provide services and that is (or will be) accompanied by a contract for the actual lease, charter, or provision of services only as provided in subsection (b) if the contract for the actual lease, charter, or provision of services is (or will be) a contract described in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary may make a contract described in subsection (a)(1) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary has been specifically authorized by law to make the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) before a solicitation for proposals for the contract was issued the Secretary notified the Committees on Armed Services and on Appropriations of the Senate and House of Representatives of the Secretary's intention to issue such a solicitation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary has notified the Committees on Armed Services and on Appropriations of the Senate and House of Representatives of the proposed contract and provided a detailed description of the terms of the proposed contract and a justification for entering into the proposed contract rather than providing for the lease, charter, or services involved through purchase of the vessel or aircraft to be used under the contract, and a period of 30 days of continuous session of Congress has expired following the date on which notice was received by such committees.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(C), the continuity of a session of Congress is broken only by an adjournment of the Congress sine die, and the days on which either House is not in session because of an adjournment of more than three days to a day certain are excluded in a computation of such 30-day period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Funds may not be appropriated for any fiscal year to or for any armed force or obligated or expended for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the long-term lease or charter of any aircraft or naval vessel; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">unless funds for that purpose have been specifically authorized by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Funds appropriated to the Department of Defense pursuant to an authorization contained in the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1984 (Public Law 98&ndash;94), or in any other law enacted after September 24, 1983, may not be used to indemnify any person under the terms of a contract entered into under this section&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the term of which is for a period of five years or longer or more than one-half the useful life of the vessel or aircraft; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the initial term of which is for a period of less than five years but which contains an option to renew or extend the agreement for a period which, when added to the initial term (or any previous renewal or extension), is five years or longer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the term of which is for a period of three years or longer; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the initial term of which is for a period of less than three years but which contains an option to renew or extend the agreement for a period which, when added to the initial term (or any previous renewal or extension), is three years or longer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the present value of the amount of the termination liability of the United States under the contract as of the end of the term of the contract (exclusive of any option to extend the contract); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the present value of the total of the payments to be made by the United States under the contract (excluding any option to extend the contract) attributable to capital-hire,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">is more than one-half the price of the vessel or aircraft involved.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Whenever a request is submitted to Congress for the authorization of the long-term lease or charter of aircraft or naval vessels or for the authorization of a lease or charter of aircraft or naval vessels which provides for a substantial termination liability on the part of the United States, the Secretary of Defense shall submit with that request an analysis of the cost to the United States (including lost tax revenues) of any such lease or charter arrangement compared with the cost to the United States of direct procurement of the aircraft or naval vessels by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any such analysis shall be reviewed and evaluated by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of the Treasury within 30 days after the date on which the request and analysis are submitted to Congress. The Director and Secretary shall conduct such review and evaluation on the basis of the guidelines issued pursuant to subsection (f) and shall report to Congress in writing on the results of their review and evaluation at the earliest practicable date, but in no event more than 45 days after the date on which the request and analysis are submitted to the Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever a request is submitted to Congress for the authorization of funds for the Department of Defense for the long-term lease or charter of aircraft or naval vessels authorized under this section, the Secretary of Defense&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall indicate in the request what portion of the requested funds is attributable to capital-hire; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall reflect such portion in the appropriate procurement account in the request.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of the Treasury shall jointly issue guidelines for determining under what circumstances the Department of Defense may use lease or charter arrangements for aircraft and naval vessels rather than directly procuring such aircraft and vessels.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;weapon system&rdquo; means items that can be used directly by the armed forces to carry out combat missions and that cost more than $100,000 or for which the eventual total procurement cost is more than $10,000,000. Such term does not include commercial items sold in substantial quantities to the general public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;prime contractor&rdquo; means a party that enters into an agreement directly with the United States to furnish part or all of a weapon system.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The term &ldquo;essential performance requirements&rdquo;, with respect to a weapon system, means the operating capabilities or maintenance and reliability characteristics of the system that are determined by the Secretary of Defense to be necessary for the system to fulfill the military requirement for which the system is designed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The term &ldquo;component&rdquo; means any constituent element of a weapon system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The term &ldquo;mature full-scale production&rdquo; means the manufacture of all units of a weapon system after the manufacture of the first one-tenth of the eventual total production or the initial production quantity of such system, whichever is less.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The term &ldquo;initial production quantity&rdquo; means the number of units of a weapon system contracted for in the first year of full-scale production.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The term &ldquo;head of an agency&rdquo; has the meaning given that term in section 2302 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the head of an agency may not after January 1, 1985, enter into a contract for the production of a weapon system unless each prime contractor for the system provides the United States with written guarantees that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the item provided under the contract will conform to the design and manufacturing requirements specifically delineated in the production contract (or in any amendment to that contract);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the item provided under the contract, at the time it is delivered to the United States, will be free from all defects in materials and workmanship;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the item provided under the contract will conform to the essential performance requirements of the item as specifically delineated in the production contract (or in any amendment to that contract); and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) pay costs reasonably incurred by the United States in taking such corrective action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The head of the agency concerned may not require guarantees under subsection (b) from a prime contractor for a weapon system, or for a component of a weapon system, that is furnished by the United States to the contractor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Subject to subsection (e)(1), the Secretary of Defense may waive part or all of subsection (b) in the case of a weapon system, or component of a weapon system, if the Secretary determines&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:776 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the waiver is necessary in the interest of national defense; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that a guarantee under that subsection would not be cost-effective.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary may not delegate authority under this subsection to any person who holds a position below the level of Assistant Secretary of Defense or Assistant Secretary of a military department.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) The requirement for a guarantee under subsection (b)(3) applies only in the case of a contract for a weapon system that is in mature full-scale production. However, nothing in this section prohibits the head of the agency concerned from negotiating a guarantee similar to the guarantee described in that subsection for a weapon system not yet in mature full-scale production. When a contract for a weapon system not yet in mature full-scale production is not to include the full guarantee described in subsection (b)(3), the Secretary shall comply with the notice requirements of subsection (e).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Nothing in this section prohibits the head of the agency concerned from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) negotiating the specific details of a guarantee, including reasonable exclusions, limitations and time duration, so long as the negotiated guarantee is consistent with the general requirements of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) requiring that components of a weapon system furnished by the United States to a contractor be properly installed so as not to invalidate any warranty or guarantee provided by the manufacturer of such component to the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) reducing the price of any contract for a weapon system or other defense equipment to take account of any payment due from a contractor pursuant to subclause (B) of subsection (b)(4);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in the case of a dual source procurement, exempting from the requirements of subsection (b)(3) an amount of production by the second source contractor equivalent to the first one-tenth of the eventual total production by the second source contractor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) using written guarantees to a greater extent than required by this section, including guarantees that exceed those in clauses (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (b) and guarantees that provide more comprehensive remedies than the remedies specified under clause (4) of that subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The regulations shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Guidelines for negotiating contractor guarantees that are reasonable and cost effective, as determined on the basis of the likelihood of defects and the estimated cost of correcting such defects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Procedures for administering contractor guarantees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Guidelines for determining the cases in which it may be appropriate to waive the requirements of this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2409. Contractor employees: protection from reprisal for disclosure of certain information</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition of Reprisals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An employee of a contractor may not be discharged, demoted, or otherwise discriminated against as a reprisal for disclosing to a Member of Congress or an authorized official of an agency or the Department of Justice information relating to a substantial violation of law related to a contract (including the competition for or negotiation of a contract).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Investigation of Complaints</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person who believes that the person has been subjected <!-- PDFPage:780 -->to a reprisal prohibited by subsection (a) may submit a complaint to the Inspector General of an agency. Unless the Inspector General determines that the complaint is frivolous, the Inspector General shall investigate the complaint and, upon completion of such investigation, submit a report of the findings of the investigation to the person, the contractor concerned, and the head of the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Remedy and Enforcement Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the head of the agency determines that a contractor has subjected a person to a reprisal prohibited by subsection (a), the head of the agency may take one or more of the following actions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Order the contractor to take affirmative action to abate the reprisal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Order the contractor to reinstate the person to the position that the person held before the reprisal, together with the compensation (including back pay), employment benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment that would apply to the person in that position if the reprisal had not been taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Order the contractor to pay the complainant an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees and expert witnesses&rsquo; fees) that were reasonably incurred by the complainant for, or in connection with, bringing the complaint regarding the reprisal, as determined by the head of the agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever a person fails to comply with an order issued under paragraph (1), the head of the agency shall file an action for enforcement of such order in the United States district court for a district in which the reprisal was found to have occurred.

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 103&ndash;160, div. A, title II, &sect;234, Nov. 30, 1993, 107 Stat. 1595, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Section 232(a)(1) of the Missile Defense Act of 1991 [Pub. L. 102&ndash;190] (10 U.S.C. 2431 note) establishes a goal for the United States to comply with the ABM Treaty (including any protocol or amendment thereto) and not develop, test, or deploy any ballistic missile defense system, or component thereof, in violation of that treaty (as modified by any protocol or amendment thereto) while deploying an anti-ballistic missile system capable of providing a highly effective defense of the United States against limited attacks of ballistic missiles.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Department of Defense has conducted no formal compliance review of any of the components or systems scheduled for early deployment as part of either the Theater Missile Defense Initiative or the initial limited defense system to be located at Grand Forks, North Dakota.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Department of Defense is continuing to obligate hundreds of millions of dollars for the development and testing of systems or components of ballistic missile defense systems before a determination has been made that, if successfully developed, tested, or deployed, those systems and components would be in compliance with the ABM Treaty.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The President requested the authorization and appropriation of additional funds for continued development of such systems and components during fiscal year 1994.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The United States and its allies face existing and expanding threats from ballistic missiles capable of being used as theater weapon systems that are presently possessed by, being developed by, or being acquired by a number of countries, including Iraq, Iran, and North Korea.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Some theater ballistic missiles presently deployed or being developed (such as the Chinese-made CSS&ndash;2) have capabilities equal to or greater than the capabilities of missiles which were determined to be strategic missiles more than 20 years ago under the SALT I Interim Agreement of 1972 entered into between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The ABM Treaty was not intended to, and does not, apply to or limit research, development, testing, or deployment of missile defense systems, system upgrades, or system components that are designed to counter modern theater ballistic missiles, regardless of the capabilities of such missiles, unless those systems, system upgrades, or system components are tested against or have demonstrated capabilities to counter modern strategic ballistic missiles.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) It is a national security priority of the United States to develop and deploy highly effective theater missile defense systems capable of countering the existing and expanding threats posed by modern theater ballistic missiles as soon as is technically possible.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) It is essential that the Secretary of Defense immediately undertake and complete a review for compliance with the ABM Treaty of proposed theater missile defense systems, system upgrades, and system components so as to not delay the development and <!-- PDFPage:797 -->deployment of such highly effective theater missile defense systems.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Required Compliance Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall review the current baseline configuration of each system or system upgrade specified in paragraph (2), and the system components, to determine whether the development, testing, or deployment of that system or system upgrade would be in compliance with the ABM Treaty, including the interpretation of the Treaty set forth in the enclosure to the July 13, 1993, ACDA letter.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) The systems and system upgrades to be reviewed pursuant to paragraph (1) are the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(A) The Patriot Multimode Missile.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) The Extended Range Interceptor (ERINT).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) The Ground-Based Radar for theater missile defenses (GBR&ndash;T).</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(G) Upgrades to the Standard Missile&ndash;2 (SM&ndash;2) interceptor of the Navy.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(3) If during the course of the compliance review under paragraph (1) (or any other such compliance review of a ballistic missile system or system upgrade), an issue arises that appears to indicate that a provision of the ABM Treaty may limit research, development, testing, or deployment by the United States of highly effective theater missile defense systems capable of countering modern theater ballistic missiles, the Secretary of Defense shall immediately submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on that issue.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) For each system and system upgrade specified in paragraph (2) of subsection (b), the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on the results of the review required by that subsection. A report may include the results of the reviews of more than one system and system upgrade. For any system or system upgrade determined not to be in compliance with the ABM Treaty, the Secretary shall indicate (A) what changes to the ABM Treaty would be required for the system to be deemed compliant with such modified ABM Treaty, and (B) what changes to the performance capability of the system or system upgrade would be required in order for it to become compliant with the existing Treaty, together with the effect of those performance capability changes on the effectiveness of the planned missile defense architecture.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) With regard to the Brilliant Eyes space-based sensor system, the Secretary shall include in the report findings on each of the following issues:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(A) Whether the current baseline configuration of the Brilliant Eyes space-based sensor system would comply with the ABM Treaty if the system were used in conjunction with the planned ground-based radar system and its ground-based interceptors at Grand Forks, North Dakota.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) If not, whether design changes or operational changes can be made to the Brilliant Eyes space-based sensor system that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(i) will result in the sensor system, when employed in conjunction with the planned ground-based radar system and its ground-based interceptors, being in compliance with the ABM Treaty; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(ii) will not prevent the sensor system from performing its strategic defense missions with a high degree of effectiveness.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) If not, whether the Brilliant Eyes space-based sensor system can be made, through design changes or operational changes, for use only with theater missile defense systems and be in compliance with the ABM Treaty.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(D) If so, the extent to which deployment of the Brilliant Eyes space-based sensor system would enhance the capability of upper-tier theater defense systems and lower-tier theater defense systems, respectively.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Limitations on Funding Pending Submission of Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not more than 50 percent of the funds reported pursuant to section 231(e) [107 Stat. 1593] to be allocated for fiscal year 1994 for a system or system upgrade specified in subsection (b)(2) may be obligated for that system or system upgrade, or any of its components, until the Secretary completes the compliance review of such system or system upgrade required by subsection (b) and submits to the appropriate congressional committees the report on the results of the compliance review of that system or system upgrade as required by subsection (c).</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) Funds appropriated to the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1994, or otherwise made available to the Department of Defense from any funds appropriated for fiscal year 1994 or for any fiscal year before 1994, may not be obligated or expended&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Systems to provide effective defense against theater and tactical ballistic missiles that may be developed and deployed by the United States have the potential to make contributions to the national security interests of nations that are allies of the United States that would be equal to or greater than the contributions such systems would make to the national security interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The cost of developing and deploying a broad spectrum of such systems will be several tens of billions of dollars.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) A truly cooperative multinational approach to the development and deployment of such systems could substantially reduce the financial burden of such an undertaking on any one country and would involve additional sources of technological expertise.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) While leaders of nations that are allies of the United States have stated an interest in becoming involved, or increasing involvement, in United States tactical missile defense programs, the governments of those nations are unlikely to support programs for theater missile defense development and deployment unless, at a minimum, they can participate in meaningful ways in the planning and execution of such programs, including active participation in research and development and production of the systems involved.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Given the high cost of developing theater ballistic missile defense systems, the participation of United States allies in the efforts to develop tactical missile defenses would result in substantial savings to the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Plan and Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall develop a plan to coordinate development and implementation of Theater Missile Defense programs of the United States with theater missile defense programs of United States allies, with the goal of avoiding duplication of effort, increasing interoperability, and reducing costs. The plan shall set forth in detail any financial, in-kind, or other form of participation by each nation in cooperative efforts to plan, develop, produce, and deploy theater ballistic missile defenses for the mutual benefit of the countries involved.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) The Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the plan developed under paragraph (1).

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2457  . Standardization of equipment with North Atlantic Treaty Organization members  </h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) It is the policy of the United States to standardize equipment, including weapons systems, ammunition, and fuel, procured for the use of the armed forces of the United States stationed in Europe under the North Atlantic Treaty or at least to make that equipment interoperable with equipment of other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. To carry out this policy, the Secretary of Defense shall&mdash;  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) assess the costs and possible loss of nonnuclear combat effectiveness of the military forces of the members of the Organization caused by the failure of the members to standardize equipment;  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) maintain a list of actions to be taken, including an evaluation of the priority and effect of the action, to standardize equipment <!-- PDFPage:821 -->that may improve the overall nonnuclear defense capability of the Organization or save resources for the Organization; and  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) initiate and carry out, to the maximum extent feasible, procurement procedures to acquire standardized or interoperable equipment, considering the cost, function, quality, and availability of the equipment.  </p>
<br class="Q04" />
  <p class="statutory-body">(b) Progress in realizing the objectives of standardization and interoperability would be enhanced by expanded inter-Allied procurement of arms and equipment within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Expanded inter-Allied procurement would be made easier by greater reliance on licensing and coproduction cooperative agreements among the signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty. If constructed to preserve the efficiencies associated with economies of scale, the agreements could minimize potential economic hardship to parties to the agreements and increase the survivability, in time of war, of the North Atlantic Alliance's armaments production base by dispersing manufacturing facilities. In conjunction with other members of the Organization and to the maximum extent feasible, the Secretary shall&mdash;  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) identify areas in which those cooperative agreements may be made with members of the Alliance; and  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) negotiate those agreements.  </p>
<br class="Q04" />
  <p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) It is the sense of Congress that weapons systems being developed wholly or primarily for employment in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization theater should conform to a common Organization requirement in order to proceed toward joint doctrine and planning and to facilitate maximum feasible standardization and interoperability of equipment, and that a common Organization requirement should be understood to include a common definition of the military threat to the members of the Organization.  </p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) It is further the sense of Congress that standardization of weapons and equipment within the Organization on the basis of a &ldquo;two-way street&rdquo; concept of cooperation in defense procurement between Europe and North America can only work in a realistic sense if the European nations operate on a united and collective basis. Therefore, the governments of Europe are encouraged to accelerate their present efforts to achieve European armaments collaboration among all European members of the Organization.  </p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Before February 1, 1989, and biennially thereafter, the Secretary shall submit a report to Congress that includes&mdash;  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) each specific assessment and evaluation made and the results of each assessment and evaluation, and the results achieved with the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, under subsections (a)(1) and (2) and (b);  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) procurement action initiated on each new major system not complying with the policy of subsection (a);  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) procurement action initiated on each new major system that is not standardized or interoperable with equipment of other members of the Organization, including a description of the system chosen and the reason for choosing that system;  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the identity of&mdash;  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) each program of research and development for the armed forces of the United States stationed in Europe that supports, conforms, or both, to common Organization requirements of developing weapon systems for use by the Organization, including a common definition of the military threat to the Organization; and  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the common requirements of the Organization to which those programs conform or which they support;  </p>
<br class="Q04" />
  <p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) action of the Alliance toward common Organization requirements if none exist;  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) efforts to establish a regular procedure and mechanism in the Organization to determine common military requirements;  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) a description of each existing and planned program of the Department of Defense that supports the development or procurement of a weapon system or other military equipment originally developed or procured by members of the Organization other than the United States and for which funds have been authorized to be appropriated for the fiscal year in which the report is submitted, including a summary listing of the amount of funds&mdash;  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) appropriated for those programs for the fiscal year in which the report is submitted; and  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) requested, or proposed to be requested, for those programs for each of the 2 fiscal years following the fiscal year for which the report is submitted; and  </p>
<br class="Q04" />
  <p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) a description of each weapon system or other military equipment originally developed or procured in the United States and that is being developed or procured by members of the Organization other than the United States during the fiscal year for which the report is submitted.  </p>
<br class="Q04" />
  <p class="statutory-body">(e) If the Secretary decides that procurement of equipment manufactured outside the United States is necessary to carry out the policy of subsection (a), the Secretary may determine under section 2 of title III of the Act of March 3, 1933 (41 U.S.C. 10a), that acquiring that equipment manufactured in the United States is inconsistent with the public interest.  </p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary shall submit the results of each assessment and evaluation made under subsection (a)(1) and (2) to the appropriate North Atlantic Treaty Organization body to become an integral part of the overall Organization review of force goals and development of force plans.  </p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Use of Programs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense, acting through the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, and in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Energy, shall promote the improvement of the subtier defense industry through use of manufacturing extension programs. Manufacturing extension programs so used shall include programs carried out by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to section 25 and section 26 of the Act of March 3, 1901 (15 U.S.C. 278k and 278<em>l</em>) and section 5121(b) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 278<em>l</em> note).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Program Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall, in order to further the national security objectives set forth in section 2501(a) of this title, establish a program&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to support existing manufacturing extension programs of regions, States, local governments, and private, nonprofit organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to promote the development of a broad range of such programs that will benefit both the national security and the economic prosperity of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to increase the involvement of appropriate segments of the private sector in activities that improve the manufacturing quality, productivity, and performance of United States-based small manufacturing firms.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In awarding financial assistance under the program, the Secretary, on the basis of merit pursuant to a competitive selection process, shall select manufacturing extension programs that demonstrate evidence of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Comprehensive and high quality services, including staff with significant experience in industrial manufacturing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Significant involvement by, and support from, private industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The potential for assisting a significant number of United States-based small manufacturing firms with a limited expenditure of Federal funds.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary shall ensure that the amount of financial assistance furnished by the Federal Government to a manufacturing extension program under this subsection may not exceed 50 percent of the total cost of the program. Financial assistance shall be provided to a recipient program for a period of five years unless such financial assistance is earlier terminated for good cause. Recipients of such financial assistance shall be required to report to the Secretary annually beginning one year after the date that such financial assistance is initiated. Such report shall include a description of the progress of the recipient program in meeting the objectives set out in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary of Defense shall require a major evaluation of each manufacturing extension program receiving financial assistance under this subsection. The evaluation shall be conducted during the third year that such program receives such financial assistance. If, on the basis of such evaluation, the Secretary finds that the financial assistance to the extension program should be terminated for good cause, the Secretary shall provide sufficient financial assistance to terminate that program. The amount of that assistance may not exceed the amount that would otherwise have been provided for continuing the financial assistance to the recipient program through the end of the fourth year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Subparagraphs (A) and (B) do not prohibit a recipient program from reapplying for financial assistance under this subsection upon the expiration or termination of the furnishing of financial assistance under this subsection. The application for additional financial assistance shall be subject to the requirements and procedures set out in this subsection in the same manner and to the same extent as initial applications for financial assistance under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary may prescribe regulations to provide for consideration of in-kind contributions by non-Federal Government participants in a manufacturing extension program for the purpose of calculating the share of the costs that has been or is being undertaken by such participants. In such regulations, the Secretary may authorize a participant that is a small business concern to use funds received under the Small Business Innovation Research Program or the Small Business Technology Transfer Program to help pay the costs of the program. Any such funds so used may be considered in calculating the amount of the financial commitment undertaken by the non-Federal Government participants unless the Secretary determines that the small business concern has not made a significant equity percentage contribution in the program from non-Federal sources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Commerce shall enter into an agreement for carrying out the program established pursuant to this subsection. The agreement shall include procedures to ensure that the program is fully coordinated with related manufacturing programs of the Department of Commerce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Establishment of Program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense, in consultation and coordination with the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce, shall establish a program to further the national security objectives set forth in section 2501(a) of this title and the defense reinvestment, diversification, and conversion program objectives set forth in section 2501(b) of this title by providing support to entities referred to in subsection (b) for programs described in that subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Programs Supported</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may provide support under this section for programs sponsored by the Federal Government, regional entities, States, local governments, and private entities and nonprofit organizations that assist businesses economically dependent on Department of Defense expenditures to acquire dual-use capabilities through the provision under those programs of the following forms of assistance:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Assistance in converting from government-oriented management, production, training, and marketing practices to commercial practices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Assistance in acquiring and using public and private sector resources, literature, and other information concerning&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) research, development, and production processes and practices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) identification of technologies and products having the potential for defense and nondefense commercial applications;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) marketing practices and opportunities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) identification of potential suppliers, partners, and subcontractors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) identification of opportunities for government support, including support through grants, contracts, partnerships, and consortia;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) enhancement of workforce skills and capabilities, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) development and introduction of high-performance work systems, workforce literacy programs, and programs for worker education and training;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) other programs that build upon the skills and capabilities of the workforce; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) trade and export assistance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Loan guarantees to small business concerns and medium-sized business concerns that are economically dependent on defense expenditures, under the terms and conditions specified under other applicable law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to subsection (d), the Secretary may provide a program referred to in subsection (b) with technical and other assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary is authorized to carry out a program to provide assistance to small businesses that are economically dependent on defense expenditures to obtain access to a national network of scientists and engineers, and to information resources (including access through on-line data bases to local, national, and international technical and business literature encompassing a wide range of technologies), that can help minimize technical risk and thereby facilitate the development and commercialization of new products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Financial Commitment of Non-Federal Government Participants</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall ensure that the amount of funds provided by the Secretary to a program under this section does not exceed 50 percent of the total cost of the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may prescribe regulations to provide for consideration of in-kind contributions by non-Federal Government participants in a program under this section for the purpose of calculating the share of the costs that has been or is being undertaken by such participants. In such regulations, the Secretary may authorize a participant that is a small business concern to use funds received under the Small Business Innovation Research Program or the Small Business Technology Transfer Program to help pay the costs of the program. Any such funds so used may be considered in calculating the amount of the financial commitment under<!-- PDFPage:859 -->taken by the non-Federal Government participants unless the Secretary determines that the small business concern has not made a significant equity percentage contribution in the program from non-Federal sources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall consider a program proposal submitted by a small business concern without regard to the ability of the small business concern to immediately meet its share of the anticipated program costs. Upon the selection of a proposal submitted by a small business concern, the small business concern shall have a period of not less than 120 days in which to arrange to meet its financial commitment requirements under the program from sources other than a person of a foreign country. If the Secretary determines upon the expiration of that period that the small business concern will be unable to meet its share of the anticipated program costs, the Secretary shall revoke the selection of the program proposal submitted by the small business concern.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Special Requirements Regarding Loan Guarantees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall carry out the loan guarantee program authorized under subsection (b)(3) during any fiscal year for which funds are specifically made available to cover the costs of loan guarantees to be issued pursuant to such subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The extent to which the loans to be guaranteed would support the retention of defense workers whose employment would otherwise be permanently or temporarily terminated as a result of reductions in expenditures by the United States for defense, the termination or cancellation of a defense contract, the failure to proceed with an approved major weapon system, the merger or consolidation of the operations of a defense contractor, or the closure or realignment of a military installation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The extent to which the loans to be guaranteed would stimulate job creation and new economic activities in communities most adversely affected by reductions in expenditures by the United States for defense, the termination or cancellation of a defense contract, the failure to proceed with an approved major weapon system, the merger or consolidation of the operations of a defense contractor, or the closure or realignment of a military installation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The extent to which the loans to be guaranteed would be used to acquire (or permit the use of other funds to acquire) capital equipment to modernize or expand the facilities of the borrower to enable the borrower to remain in the national technology and industrial base available to the Department of Defense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) To be eligible for a loan guarantee under subsection (b)(3), a borrower must be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that at least 25 percent of the value of the borrower's sales during the preceding fiscal year were derived from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) contracts with the Department of Defense or the defense-related activities of the Department of Energy; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) subcontracts in support of defense-related prime contracts.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The maximum amount of loan principal that the Secretary may guarantee under the loan guarantee program during a fiscal year may not exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) $1,250,000, with respect to a small business concern; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $10,000,000 with respect to a medium-sized business concern.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Selection Process and Criteria</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Competitive procedures shall be used in the selection of programs to receive assistance under this section. The criteria for the selection of a program to receive assistance under this section shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The extent to which the program advances and enhances the national security objectives set forth in section 2501(a) of this title and the reinvestment, diversification, and conversion program objectives set forth in section 2501(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The technical excellence of the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The qualifications of the personnel proposed to participate in the program's research activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The adequacy of timely private sector investment in activities that is sufficient to achieve the goals and objectives of the programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The potential effectiveness of the program in the conversion of businesses (and their work forces) from capabilities that make the companies economically dependent on Department of Defense expenditures to capabilities having defense and nondefense commercial applications.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The ability of the program to assist businesses (and their work forces) that are adversely affected by significant reductions in Department of Defense spending.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The extent of the financial commitment by sources other than the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The extent to which the program would supplement, rather than duplicate, other available services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The likelihood that, within five years after the commencement of assistance for a program under this section (or a lesser period established by the Secretary), Department of Defense assistance will not be necessary to sustain the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Such other criteria as the Secretary prescribes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the &ldquo;medium-sized business concern&rdquo; means a business concern that is not more than two times the maximum size specified by the Administrator of the Small Business Administration for purposes of determining whether a business concern furnishing a product or service is a small business concern.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Termination of Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After September 30, 1995, funds may be provided by the Department of Defense under this section only for programs referred to in subsection (b) for which funds have been provided by the Department of Defense under this section on or before that date. No funds may be provided by the De<!-- PDFPage:860 -->partment of Defense under this section for a program referred to in subsection (b) after September 30, 1998.</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply in the case of a memorandum of understanding or agreement described in paragraph (1) if the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of State, determines that a transfer of United States defense technology pursuant to such understanding or agreement will result in strengthening the national security of the United States and so certifies to Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a United States firm is required under the terms of a memorandum of understanding, or other agreement entered into by the United States with a foreign country, to transfer defense technology to a foreign country, the United States firm may protest the determination to the Secretary of Defense on the grounds that the transfer of such technology would adversely affect the defense industrial base of the United States and would result in substantial financial loss to the protesting firm. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of State, shall make the final determination of the validity of the protesting firm's claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Notification Regarding Offsets</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If at any time a United States firm enters into a contract for the sale of a weapon system or defense-related item to a foreign country or foreign firm and such contract is subject to an offset arrangement exceeding $50,000,000 in value, such firm shall notify the Secretary of Defense of the proposed sale.

<h4 class="note-head">Contractual Offset Arrangements; Congressional Statement of Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 825(a) of Pub. L. 100&ndash;456 provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Many contracts entered into by United States firms for the supply of weapon systems or defense-related items to foreign countries and foreign firms are subject to contractual arrangements under which United States firms must agree&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) to have a specified percentage of work under, or monetary amount of, the contract performed by one or more foreign firms;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) to purchase a specified amount or quantity of unrelated goods or services from domestic sources of such foreign countries; or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) to invest a specified amount in domestic businesses of such foreign countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Such contractual arrangements, known as &lsquo;offsets&rsquo;, are a component of international trade and could have an impact on United States defense industry opportunities in domestic and foreign markets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Some United States contractors and subcontractors may be adversely affected by such contractual arrangements.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Many contracts which provide for or are subject to offset arrangements require, in connection with such arrangements, the transfer of United States technology to foreign firms.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The use of such transferred technology by foreign firms in conjunction with foreign trade practices permitted under the trade policies of the countries of such firms can give foreign firms a competitive advantage against United States firms in world markets for products using such technology.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) A purchase of defense equipment pursuant to an offset arrangement may increase the cost of the defense equipment to the purchasing country and may reduce the amount of defense equipment that a country may purchase.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The exporting of defense equipment produced in the United States is important to maintain the defense industrial base of the United States, lower the unit cost of such equipment to the Department of Defense, and encourage the standardized utilization of United States equipment by the allies of the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Negotiations With Countries Requiring Offset Arrangements</h4>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(1) The President shall enter into negotiations with foreign countries that have a policy of requiring an offset arrangement in connection with the purchase of defense equipment or supplies from the United States. The negotiations should be conducted with a view to achieving an agreement with the countries concerned that would limit the adverse effects that such arrangements have on the defense industrial base of each such country. Every effort shall be made to achieve such agreements within two years after September 29, 1988.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) In the negotiation or renegotiation of any memorandum of understanding between the United States and one or more foreign countries relating to the reciprocal procurement of defense equipment and supplies or research and development, the President shall make every effort to achieve an agreement with the country or countries concerned that would limit the adverse effects that offset arrangements have on the defense industrial base of the United States.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary of any military department, and the Secretary of Transportation, under such regulations as they may respectively prescribe, may each by public or private sale or otherwise, dispose of all lost, abandoned, or unclaimed personal property that comes into the custody or control of the Secretary's department, other than property subject to section 4712, 6522, or 9712 of this title or subject to subsection (c). However, property may not be disposed of until diligent effort has been made to find the owner (or the heirs, next of kin, or legal representative of the owner). The diligent effort to find the owner (or the heirs, next of kin, or legal representative of the owner) shall begin, to the maximum extent practicable, not later than seven days after the date on which the property comes into the custody or control of the Secretary. The period for which that effort is continued may not exceed 45 days. If the owner (or the heirs, next of kin, or legal representative of the owner) is determined but not found, the property may not be disposed of until the expiration of 45 days after the date when notice, giving the time and place of the intended sale or other disposition, has been sent by certified or registered mail to that person at his last known address. When diligent effort to determine the owner (or heirs, next of kin, or legal representative of the owner) is unsuccessful, the property may be disposed of without delay, except that if it has a fair market value of more than $300, the Secretary may not dispose of the property until 45 days after the date it is received at a storage point designated by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The net proceeds from the sale of property under this section shall be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. The owner (or the heirs, next of kin, or legal representative of the owner) may file a claim for those proceeds with the General Accounting Office within five years after the date of the disposal of the property. If not filed within that period, such a claim may not be considered by a court or the General Accounting Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) No property covered by this section may be delivered to the Armed Forces Retirement Home by the Secretary of a military department, except papers of value, sabers, insignia, decorations, medals, watches, trinkets, manuscripts, and other articles valuable chiefly as keepsakes.</p>

A member of the armed forces (or other person under the authority of the armed forces in a theater of operations) may not (except in accordance with such regulations) take from a theater of operations as a souvenir an object formerly in the possession of the enemy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Such regulations shall provide that a member of the armed forces who wishes to retain as a souvenir an object covered by paragraph (2) may so request at the time the object is turned over pursuant to paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Such regulations shall provide for an officer to be designated to review requests under paragraph (3). If the officer determines that the object may be appropriately retained as a war souvenir, the object shall be turned over to the member who requested the right to retain it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Such regulations shall provide for captured weaponry to be retained as souvenirs, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The only weapons that may be retained are those in categories to be agreed upon jointly by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2634. Motor vehicles: for members on change of permanent station</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) When a member of an armed force is ordered to make a change of permanent station, one motor vehicle that is owned or leased by the member (or a dependent of the member) and is for the personal use of the member or his dependents may, unless a motor vehicle owned or leased by him (or a dependent of his) was transported in advance of that change of permanent station under section 406(h) of title 37, be transported, at the expense of the United States, to his new station or such other place as the Secretary concerned may authorize&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on a vessel owned, leased, or chartered by the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by privately owned American shipping services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) by foreign-flag shipping services if shipping services described in clauses (1) and (2) are not reasonably available; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) by other surface transportation if such means of transport does not exceed the cost to the United States of other authorized means.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">When the Secretary concerned determines that a replacement for that motor vehicle is necessary for reasons beyond the control of the member and is in the interest of the United States, and he approves the transportation in advance, one additional motor vehicle of the member (or a dependent of the member) may be so transported.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;change of permanent station&rdquo; means the transfer or assignment of a member of the armed forces from a permanent station inside the continental United States to a permanent station outside the continental United States or from a permanent station outside the continental United States to another permanent station. It also includes an authorized change in home port of a vessel, or a transfer <!-- PDFPage:891 -->or assignment between two permanent stations in the continental United States when the member cannot, because of injury or the conditions of the order, drive the motor vehicle between the permanent duty stations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;continental United States&rdquo; does not include Alaska.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When there has been a shipping error, or when orders directing a change of permanent station have been canceled, revoked, or modified after receipt by the member, a motor vehicle transported pursuant to this section may also be reshipped or transshipped in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When the Secretary concerned makes a determination under section 406(l) of title 37 that the dependents of a member on a permanent change of station are unable to accompany the member to an overseas duty station because of unexpected and uncontrollable circumstances, and the member shipped a motor vehicle pursuant to this section in anticipation of a dependent accompanying the member to the new duty station, the member may reship or transship such motor vehicle in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary of Defense (and the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy) may prescribe regulations limiting those leased motor vehicles that may be transported pursuant to this section based upon the length of the lease and other terms and conditions of the lease that the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) No carrier, port agent, warehouseman, freight forwarder, or other person involved in the transportation of property may have any lien on, or hold, impound, or otherwise interfere with, the movement of a motor vehicle being transported under this section.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1958 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">The deletion of the last sentence of section 2663(a) and the last sentence of section 2664(a) reflects their implied repeal by Rule 71A of the Rules of Civil Procedure for the United States District Courts (see 28 U.S.C. 2072). (See letter from Assistant Attorney General (Lands Division), Department of Justice, August 1957, to General Counsel, Department of Defense.) The other changes conform section 2664 to section 2663, both of which were based on the same source statute (sec. 8 of the Act of July 9, 1918, ch. 143, subch.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A land acquisition project may not be placed under contract if, based upon the agreed price for the land or, in the case of land to be acquired by condemnation, the amount to be deposited with the court as just compensation for the land&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">until subsection (d) is complied with.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The limitations on reduction in scope or increase in cost of a land acquisition in subsection (c) do not apply if the reduction in scope or the increase in cost, as the case may be, is approved by the Secretary concerned and a written notification of the facts relating to the proposed reduced scope or increased cost (including a statement of the reasons therefor) is submitted by the Secretary concerned to the appropriate committees of Congress.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary of Defense shall encourage the use of energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy as a source of energy for military construction projects (including military family housing projects) where use of such form of energy would be practical and economically feasible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary concerned shall require that the design of all new facilities (including family housing) shall include consideration of energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy in those cases in which use of such forms of energy has the potential for reduced energy costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary concerned shall require that contracts for construction resulting from such design include a requirement that energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy be installed if such systems can be shown to be cost effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) For the purposes of this section, an energy system using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy for a facility shall be considered to be cost effective if the difference between (A) the original investment cost of the energy system for the facility with such a system, and (B) the original investment cost of the energy system for the facility without such a system can be recovered over the expected life of the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A determination under paragraph (1) concerning whether a cost-differential can be recovered over the expected life of a facility shall be made using the life-cycle cost methods and procedures established pursuant to section 544(a) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8254(a)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In order to equip a military construction project (including a military family housing project) with heating equipment, cooling equipment, or both heating and cooling equipment using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy or with a passive energy system using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy, the Secretary concerned may authorize an increase in any otherwise applicable limitation with respect to the number of square feet or the cost per square foot of the project by such amount as may be necessary for such purpose.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) will meet the same end needs as the equipment or system being repaired; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) improvements in an operation or maintenance process, such as improved training or improved controls, that result in reduced costs through energy savings.</p>
