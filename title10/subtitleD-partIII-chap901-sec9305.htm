<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe&rdquo; are omitted, since the Secretary has inherent authority to issue regulations appropriate to exercising his statutory functions. The words &ldquo;Air Force training commands&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;the Air Corps Training Center&rdquo;, since those commands now perform the functions formerly performed by the Air Corps Training Center. The words &ldquo;in his discretion&rdquo;, &ldquo;experience&rdquo;, and &ldquo;upon their own applications&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;and may provide for the instruction and training&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;is authorized to enroll as students  for the pursuit of such courses of instruction as may be prescribed therefor&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;the furnishing of such&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;mateï¿½AE1riel, or equipment&rdquo; are omitted as covered by the word &ldquo;supplies&rdquo;, as defined in section 101(26) of this title.</p>
