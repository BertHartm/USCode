<p class="statutory-body">(a) Only vessels of the United States or belonging to the United States may be used in the transportation by sea of supplies bought for the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps. However, if the President finds that the freight charged by those vessels is excessive or otherwise unreasonable, contracts for transportation may be made as otherwise provided by law. Charges made for the transportation of those supplies by those vessels may not be higher than the charges made for transporting like goods for private persons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In each request for proposals to enter into a time-charter contract for the use of a vessel for the transportation of supplies under this section, the Secretary of Defense shall require that any reflagging or repair work on a vessel for which a proposal is submitted in response to the request for proposals be performed in the United States (including any territory of the United States).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;reflagging or repair work&rdquo; means work performed on a vessel&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to enable the vessel to meet applicable standards to become a vessel of the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to convert the vessel to a more useful military configuration.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Defense may waive the requirement described in paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines that such waiver is critical to the national security of the United States. The Secretary shall immediately notify the Congress of any such waiver and the reasons for such waiver.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2634. Motor vehicles: for members on change of permanent station</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) When a member of an armed force is ordered to make a change of permanent station, one motor vehicle that is owned or leased by the member (or a dependent of the member) and is for the personal use of the member or his dependents may, unless a motor vehicle owned or leased by him (or a dependent of his) was transported in advance of that change of permanent station under section 406(h) of title 37, be transported, at the expense of the United States, to his new station or such other place as the Secretary concerned may authorize&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on a vessel owned, leased, or chartered by the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by privately owned American shipping services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) by foreign-flag shipping services if shipping services described in clauses (1) and (2) are not reasonably available; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) by other surface transportation if such means of transport does not exceed the cost to the United States of other authorized means.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:893 --><p class="statutory-body-block">When the Secretary concerned determines that a replacement for that motor vehicle is necessary for reasons beyond the control of the member and is in the interest of the United States, and he approves the transportation in advance, one additional motor vehicle of the member (or a dependent of the member) may be so transported.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;change of permanent station&rdquo; means the transfer or assignment of a member of the armed forces from a permanent station inside the continental United States to a permanent station outside the continental United States or from a permanent station outside the continental United States to another permanent station. It also includes an authorized change in home port of a vessel, or a transfer or assignment between two permanent stations in the continental United States when the member cannot, because of injury or the conditions of the order, drive the motor vehicle between the permanent duty stations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;continental United States&rdquo; does not include Alaska.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When there has been a shipping error, or when orders directing a change of permanent station have been canceled, revoked, or modified after receipt by the member, a motor vehicle transported pursuant to this section may also be reshipped or transshipped in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When the Secretary concerned makes a determination under section 406(l) of title 37 that the dependents of a member on a permanent change of station are unable to accompany the member to an overseas duty station because of unexpected and uncontrollable circumstances, and the member shipped a motor vehicle pursuant to this section in anticipation of a dependent accompanying the member to the new duty station, the member may reship or transship such motor vehicle in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary of Defense (and the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy) may prescribe regulations limiting those leased motor vehicles that may be transported pursuant to this section based upon the length of the lease and other terms and conditions of the lease that the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) No carrier, port agent, warehouseman, freight forwarder, or other person involved in the transportation of property may have any lien on, or hold, impound, or otherwise interfere with, the movement of a motor vehicle being transported under this section.</p>
