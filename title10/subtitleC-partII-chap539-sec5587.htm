<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the word &ldquo;annually&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;and regularly commission&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The word &ldquo;male&rdquo; is inserted in subsection (a) to limit the application of the appointing authority in this subsection to men. Authority to appoint women is covered in &sect;5590 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the words &ldquo;on the active list&rdquo; are inserted in order to exclude reserve and temporary officers, which is the intention of Congress determined from the use of the words &ldquo;additional numbers in grade&rdquo; and &ldquo;percentage of officers on the active list&rdquo; which apply only to regular officers holding permanent appointments. In the same subsection and in subsections (c) and (d) the provisions of the law that these officers are assigned to a certain duty and then &ldquo;described and known as officers designated&rdquo; for that duty have been written simply as providing that these officers may be &ldquo;designated&rdquo; for that duty. This is done as there is no apparent reason for any distinction between these officers and those appointed under subsection (a). In subsection (c) the words &ldquo;specialized duties in the fields of&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.</p>
