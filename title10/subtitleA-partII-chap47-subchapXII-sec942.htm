<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) during a period a judge of the court is unable to perform his duties because of illness or other disability;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in any case in which a judge of the court recuses himself; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) during a period when there is a vacancy on the court and in the opinion of the chief judge of the court such a designation is necessary for the proper dispatch of the business of the court.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
