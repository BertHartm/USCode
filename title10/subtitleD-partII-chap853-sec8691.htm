<p class="note-body">10:291c (proviso) and the words &ldquo;after June 30, 1948&rdquo;, in 10:291c&ndash;1, are omitted as executed. The definition of the term &ldquo;flying officer&rdquo;, in 10:291c, originally was a definition of the term &ldquo;flying officer in time of peace&rdquo; as provided by section 2 of the Act of July 2, 1926, ch. 721, 44 Stat. 781. Section 1 of the Act of October 4, 1940, ch. 742, 54 Stat. 963, eliminated the words &ldquo;in time of peace&rdquo;. As a consequence of that amendment, 10:291e (1st 26 words) is omitted as surplusage. Clause (2) is substituted for 10:291c&ndash;1 (less last 10 words). The words &ldquo;commissioned officers or warrant&rdquo;, in 10:291c&ndash;1, are omitted as surplusage. In clause (4), the last 19 words are substituted for the words &ldquo;any other&rdquo;.  </p>
