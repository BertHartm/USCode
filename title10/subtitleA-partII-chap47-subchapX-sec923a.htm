<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Any person subject to this chapter who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for the procurement of any article or thing of value, with intent to defraud; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for the payment of any past due obligation, or for any other purpose, with intent to deceive;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">makes, draws, utters, or delivers any check, draft, or order for the payment of money upon any bank or other depository, knowing at the time that the maker or drawer has not or will not have sufficient funds in, or credit with, the bank or other depository for the payment of that check, draft, or order in full upon its presentment, shall be punished as a court-martial may direct. The making, drawing, uttering, or delivering by a maker or drawer of a check, draft, or order, payment of which is refused by the drawee because of insufficient funds of the maker or drawer in the drawee's possession or control, is prima facie evidence of his intent to defraud or deceive and of his knowledge of insufficient funds in, or credit with, that bank or other depository, unless the maker or drawer pays the holder the amount due within five days after receiving notice, orally or in writing, that the check, draft, or order was not paid on presentment. In this section, the word &ldquo;credit&rdquo; means an arrangement or understanding, express or implied, with the bank or other depository for the payment of that check, draft, or order.</p>
