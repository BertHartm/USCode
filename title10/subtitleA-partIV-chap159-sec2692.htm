<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary of Defense may grant exceptions to subsection (a) when essential to protect the health and safety of the public from imminent danger if the Secretary otherwise determines the exception is essential and if the storage or disposal authorized does not compete with private enterprise.</p>
