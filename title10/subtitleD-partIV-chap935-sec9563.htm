<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;enlisted member&rdquo; are substituted for the word &ldquo;soldiers&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;any articles of their&rdquo; are <!-- PDFPage:2236 -->omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;while he had that disease&rdquo; are inserted for clarity. The words &ldquo;a medical officer&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;proper medical officers&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;on the recommendation of the Surgeon General&rdquo; are omitted, since the Air Force does not have the statutory office of Surgeon General, and functions which, for the Army, are assigned by statute to subordinate officers of the Army are, for the Air Force, assigned to the Secretary of the Air Force.</p>
