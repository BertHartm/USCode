<p class="note-body">Military Order of President of the United States, dated Nov. 13, 2001, 66 F.R. 57833, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President and as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Authorization for Use of Military Force Joint Resolution (Public Law 107&ndash;40, 115 Stat. 224) [50 U.S.C. 1541 note] and sections 821 and 836 of title 10, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Findings.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) International terrorists, including members of al Qaida, have carried out attacks on United States diplomatic and military personnel and facilities abroad and on citizens and property within the United States on a scale that has created a state of armed conflict that requires the use of the United States Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In light of grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism, including the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, on the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense in the national capital region, on the World Trade Center in New York, and on civilian aircraft such as in Pennsylvania, I proclaimed a national emergency on September 14, 2001 (Proc. 7463, Declaration of National Emergency by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks [50 U.S.C. 1621 note]).</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Individuals acting alone and in concert involved in international terrorism possess both the capability and the intention to undertake further terrorist attacks against the United States that, if not detected and prevented, will cause mass deaths, mass injuries, and massive destruction of property, and may place at risk the continuity of the operations of the United States Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The ability of the United States to protect the United States and its citizens, and to help its allies and other cooperating nations protect their nations and their citizens, from such further terrorist attacks depends in significant part upon using the United States Armed Forces to identify terrorists and those who support them, to disrupt their activities, and to eliminate their ability to conduct or support such attacks.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) To protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks, it is necessary for individuals subject to this order pursuant to section 2 hereof to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Given the danger to the safety of the United States and the nature of international terrorism, and to the extent provided by and under this order, I find consistent with section 836 of title 10, United States Code, that it is not practicable to apply in military commissions under this order the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) Having fully considered the magnitude of the potential deaths, injuries, and property destruction that would result from potential acts of terrorism against the United States, and the probability that such acts will occur, I have determined that an extraordinary emergency exists for national defense purposes, that this emergency constitutes an urgent and compelling government interest, and that issuance of this order is necessary to meet the emergency.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Definition and Policy.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The term &ldquo;individual subject to this order&rdquo; shall mean any individual who is not a United States citizen with respect to whom I determine from time to time in writing that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) there is reason to believe that such individual, at the relevant times,</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(i) is or was a member of the organization known as al Qaida;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(ii) has engaged in, aided or abetted, or conspired to commit, acts of international terrorism, or acts in preparation therefor, that have caused, threaten to cause, or have as their aim to cause, injury to or adverse effects on the United States, its citizens, national security, foreign policy, or economy; or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(iii) has knowingly harbored one or more individuals described in subparagraphs (i) or (ii) of subsection 2(a)(1) of this order; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) it is in the interest of the United States that such individual be subject to this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) It is the policy of the United States that the Secretary of Defense shall take all necessary measures to ensure that any individual subject to this order is detained in accordance with section 3, and, if the individual is to be tried, that such individual is tried only in accordance with section 4.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) It is further the policy of the United States that any individual subject to this order who is not already under the control of the Secretary of Defense but who is under the control of any other officer or agent of the United States or any State shall, upon delivery of a copy of such written determination to such officer or agent, forthwith be placed under the control of the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Detention Authority of the Secretary of Defense</em>. Any individual subject to this order shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) detained at an appropriate location designated by the Secretary of Defense outside or within the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) treated humanely, without any adverse distinction based on race, color, religion, gender, birth, wealth, or any similar criteria;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) afforded adequate food, drinking water, shelter, clothing, and medical treatment;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) allowed the free exercise of religion consistent with the requirements of such detention; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) detained in accordance with such other conditions as the Secretary of Defense may prescribe.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Authority of the Secretary of Defense Regarding Trials of Individuals Subject to this Order.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Any individual subject to this order shall, when tried, be tried by military commission for any and all offenses triable by military commission that such individual is alleged to have committed, and may be punished in accordance with the penalties provided under applicable law, including life imprisonment or death.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) As a military function and in light of the findings in section 1, including subsection (f) thereof, the Secretary of Defense shall issue such orders and regulations, including orders for the appointment of one or more military commissions, as may be necessary to carry out subsection (a) of this section.</p>
