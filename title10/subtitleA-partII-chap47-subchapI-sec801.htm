<h4 class="note-head">Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism</h4>
<p class="note-body">Military Order of President of the United States, dated Nov. 13, 2001, 66 F.R. 57833, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President and as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Authorization for Use of Military Force Joint Resolution (Public Law 107&ndash;40, 115 Stat. 224) [50 U.S.C. 1541 note] and sections 821 and 836 of title 10, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Findings.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) International terrorists, including members of al Qaida, have carried out attacks on United States diplomatic and military personnel and facilities abroad and on citizens and property within the United States on a scale that has created a state of armed conflict that requires the use of the United States Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In light of grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism, including the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, on the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense in the national capital region, on the World Trade Center in New York, and on civilian aircraft such as in Pennsylvania, I proclaimed a national emergency on September 14, 2001 (Proc. 7463, Declaration of National Emergency by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks [50 U.S.C. 1621 note]).</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Individuals acting alone and in concert involved in international terrorism possess both the capability and the intention to undertake further terrorist attacks against the United States that, if not detected and prevented, will cause mass deaths, mass injuries, and massive destruction of property, and may place at risk the continuity of the operations of the United States Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The ability of the United States to protect the United States and its citizens, and to help its allies and other cooperating nations protect their nations and their citizens, from such further terrorist attacks depends in significant part upon using the United States Armed Forces to identify terrorists and those who support them, to disrupt their activities, and to eliminate their ability to conduct or support such attacks.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) To protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks, it is necessary for individuals subject to this order pursuant to section 2 hereof to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Given the danger to the safety of the United States and the nature of international terrorism, and to the extent provided by and under this order, I find consistent with section 836 of title 10, United States Code, that it is not practicable to apply in military commissions under this order the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) Having fully considered the magnitude of the potential deaths, injuries, and property destruction that would result from potential acts of terrorism against the United States, and the probability that such acts will occur, I have determined that an extraordinary emergency exists for national defense purposes, that this emergency constitutes an urgent and compelling government interest, and that issuance of this order is necessary to meet the emergency.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Definition and Policy.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The term &ldquo;individual subject to this order&rdquo; shall mean any individual who is not a United States citizen with respect to whom I determine from time to time in writing that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) there is reason to believe that such individual, at the relevant times,</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(i) is or was a member of the organization known as al Qaida;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(ii) has engaged in, aided or abetted, or conspired to commit, acts of international terrorism, or acts in preparation therefor, that have caused, threaten to cause, or have as their aim to cause, injury to or adverse effects on the United States, its citizens, national security, foreign policy, or economy; or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(iii) has knowingly harbored one or more individuals described in subparagraphs (i) or (ii) of subsection 2(a)(1) of this order; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) it is in the interest of the United States that such individual be subject to this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) It is the policy of the United States that the Secretary of Defense shall take all necessary measures to ensure that any individual subject to this order is detained in accordance with section 3, and, if the individual is to be tried, that such individual is tried only in accordance with section 4.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) It is further the policy of the United States that any individual subject to this order who is not already under the control of the Secretary of Defense but who is under the control of any other officer or agent of the United States or any State shall, upon delivery of a copy of such written determination to such officer or agent, forthwith be placed under the control of the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Detention Authority of the Secretary of Defense</em>. Any individual subject to this order shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) detained at an appropriate location designated by the Secretary of Defense outside or within the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) treated humanely, without any adverse distinction based on race, color, religion, gender, birth, wealth, or any similar criteria;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:385 --><p class="note-body">(c) afforded adequate food, drinking water, shelter, clothing, and medical treatment;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) allowed the free exercise of religion consistent with the requirements of such detention; and</p>

<p class="note-body">Departments, agencies, entities, and officers of the United States shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, provide to the Secretary of Defense such assistance as he may request to implement this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Additional Authorities of the Secretary of Defense.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) As a military function and in light of the findings in section 1, the Secretary of Defense shall issue such orders and regulations as may be necessary to carry out any of the provisions of this order.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13492. Review and Disposition of Individuals Detained At the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and Closure of Detention Facilities</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13492, Jan. 22, 2009, 74 F.R. 4897, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, in order to effect the appropriate disposition of individuals currently detained by the Department of Defense at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (Guantanamo) and promptly to close detention facilities at Guantanamo, consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and the interests of justice, I hereby order as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Definitions</em>. As used in this order:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) &ldquo;Common Article 3&rdquo; means Article 3 of each of the Geneva Conventions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Geneva Conventions&rdquo; means:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3114);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3217);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3316); and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iv) the Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3516).</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) &ldquo;Individuals currently detained at Guantanamo&rdquo; and &ldquo;individuals covered by this order&rdquo; mean individuals currently detained by the Department of Defense in facilities at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base whom the Department of Defense has ever determined to be, or treated as, enemy combatants.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Findings</em>.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Over the past 7 years, approximately 800 individuals whom the Department of Defense has ever determined to be, or treated as, enemy combatants have been detained at Guantanamo. The Federal Government has moved more than 500 such detainees from Guantanamo, either by returning them to their home country or by releasing or transferring them to a third country. The Department of Defense has determined that a number of the individuals currently detained at Guantanamo are eligible for such transfer or release.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Some individuals currently detained at Guantanamo have been there for more than 6 years, and most have been detained for at least 4 years. In view of the significant concerns raised by these detentions, both within the United States and internationally, prompt and appropriate disposition of the individuals currently detained at Guantanamo and closure of the facilities in which they are detained would further the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and the interests of justice. Merely closing the facilities without promptly determining the appropriate disposition of the individuals detained would not adequately serve those interests. To the extent practicable, the prompt and appropriate disposition of the individuals detained at Guantanamo should precede the closure of the detention facilities at Guantanamo.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The individuals currently detained at Guantanamo have the constitutional privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. Most of those individuals have filed petitions for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal court challenging the lawfulness of their detention.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) It is in the interests of the United States that the executive branch undertake a prompt and thorough review of the factual and legal bases for the continued detention of all individuals currently held at Guantanamo, and of whether their continued detention is in the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and in the interests of justice. The unusual circumstances associated with detentions at Guantanamo require a comprehensive interagency review.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) New diplomatic efforts may result in an appropriate disposition of a substantial number of individuals currently detained at Guantanamo.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Some individuals currently detained at Guantanamo may have committed offenses for which they should be prosecuted. It is in the interests of the United States to review whether and how any such individuals can and should be prosecuted.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:386 --><p class="note-body">(g) It is in the interests of the United States that the executive branch conduct a prompt and thorough review of the circumstances of the individuals currently detained at Guantanamo who have been charged with offenses before military commissions pursuant to the Military Commissions Act of 2006, Public Law 109&ndash;366, as well as of the military commission process more generally.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Closure of Detention Facilities at Guantanamo</em>. The detention facilities at Guantanamo for individuals covered by this order shall be closed as soon as practicable, and no later than 1 year from the date of this order. If any individuals covered by this order remain in detention at Guantanamo at the time of closure of those detention facilities, they shall be returned to their home country, released, transferred to a third country, or transferred to another United States detention facility in a manner consistent with law and the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">(5) <em>Consideration of Issues Relating to Transfer to the United States</em>.

The Secretary of Defense shall immediately undertake a review of the conditions of detention at Guantanamo to ensure full compliance with this directive.
