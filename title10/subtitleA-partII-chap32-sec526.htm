<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section is based on Pub. L. 95&ndash;79, title VIII, &sect;811(a), July 30, 1977, 91 Stat. 335, as amended by Pub. L. 96&ndash;107, title VIII, &sect;817, Nov. 9, 1979, 93 Stat. 818; Pub. L. 96&ndash;342, title X, &sect;1003, Sept. 8, 1980, 94 Stat. 1120; Pub. L. 97&ndash;86, title VI, &sect;602, Dec. 1, 1981, 95 Stat. 1110.</p>
<p class="note-body">Present law (section 811(a) of Public Law 95&ndash;79, as amended) provides that the authority to suspend the <!-- PDFPage:204 -->limitation on the number of general and flag officers who may be serving on active duty applies during war or national emergency. In codifying the limitation (in section 526 of title 10 as proposed to be added by section 1(b) of the bill), the committee determined that the same war and emergency waiver authority as applies to other limitations on the number of officers on active duty under the existing 10 U.S.C. 526 (redesignated as 10 U.S.C. 527 by the bill) should apply with respect to this limitation and accordingly amended the suspension authority in present law to include the codified general and flag officer limitation. This authority is slightly different from the waiver authority in the source law in that the suspension would expire 2 years after it takes effect or 1 year after the end of the war or national emergency, whichever occurs first, rather than upon termination of the war or emergency.</p>
