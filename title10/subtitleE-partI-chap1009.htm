The Committee's comments on such policy matters shall accompany the final report regarding any such matters submitted to the Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The committee consists of officers in the grade of colonel or above, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) five members of the Regular Air Force on duty with the Air Staff;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The members of the Committee shall select the Chairman from among the members on the Committee not on active duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A majority of the members of the Committee shall act whenever matters affecting both the Air National Guard of the United States and Air Force Reserve are being considered.

Except in the case of members of the Committee from the Regular Air Force, the Secretary of the Air Force, when appointing new members, shall insure that among the officers of each component on the Committee there will at all times be two or more members with more than one year of continuous service on the Committee.</p>
