<p class="statutory-body">Not later than March 1 of each year through 2008, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives a report on the B&ndash;2 bomber aircraft. Each such report shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Identification of the average full-mission capable rate of B&ndash;2 aircraft for the preceding fiscal year and the Secretary's overall assessment of the implications of that full-mission capable rate on mission accomplishment for the B&ndash;2 aircraft, together with the Secretary's determination as to whether that rate is adequate for the accomplishment of each of the missions assigned to the B&ndash;2 aircraft as of the date of the assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) An assessment of the technical capabilities of the B&ndash;2 aircraft and whether these capabilities are adequate to accomplish each of the missions assigned to that aircraft as of the date of the assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Identification of all ongoing and planned development of technologies to enhance the capabilities of that aircraft.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Identification and assessment of additional technologies that would make that aircraft more capable or survivable against known and evolving threats.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) A fiscally phased program for each technology identified in paragraphs (3) and (4) for the budget year and the future-years defense program, based on the following three funding situations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The President's current budget.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The President's current budget and the current Department of Defense unfunded priority list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The maximum executable funding for the B&ndash;2 aircraft given the requirement to maintain enough operationally ready aircraft to accomplish missions assigned to the B&ndash;2 aircraft.</p>
