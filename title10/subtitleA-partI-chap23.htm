<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) that the security environment in the early 21st century will include fundamentally different military challenges than the security environment in the late 20th century; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) reinforce the premise of the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 [Pub. L. 99&ndash;433, see Tables for classification] that future warfare will require more effective joint operational concepts.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) It is essential that an energetic and innovative organization be established in the Department of Defense with the authority (subject to the authority and guidance of the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) to design and implement a process of joint experimentation to investigate and test technologies and alternative forces and concepts in field environments under realistic conditions against the full range of future challenges to assist in developing and validating new joint warfighting concepts and transforming the Armed Forces to meet the threats to national security anticipated for the early 21st century.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Designation of Commander To Have Joint Warfighting Experimentation Mission</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that the initiative of the Secretary of Defense to designate the commander of a combatant command to have the mission of joint warfighting experimentation is a key step in exploiting the potential of advanced technologies, new organizational structures, and new joint operational concepts to transform the conduct of military operations by the Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Resources and Authority of Commander</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is, further, the sense of Congress that the commander of the combatant command referred to in subsection (a) should be provided with appropriate and sufficient resources for joint warfighting experimentation and with the appropriate authority to execute the commander's assigned responsibilities and that such authority should include the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Planning, preparing, and conducting the program of joint warfighting experimentation, which program should include analyses, simulations, wargames, experiments, advanced concept technology demonstrations, joint exercises conducted in virtual and field environments, and, as a particularly critical aspect, assessments of &lsquo;red team&rsquo; vulnerability.</p>
