<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the use of such a contract will result in substantial savings of the total anticipated costs of carrying out the program through annual contracts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that the minimum need for the property to be purchased is expected to remain substantially unchanged during the contemplated contract period in terms of production rate, procurement rate, and total quantities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that there is a reasonable expectation that throughout the contemplated contract period the head of the agency will request funding for the contract at the level required to avoid contract cancellation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that there is a stable design for the property to be acquired and that the technical risks associated with such property are not excessive;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) that the estimates of both the cost of the contract and the anticipated cost avoidance through the use of a multiyear contract are realistic; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) in the case of a purchase by the Department of Defense, that the use of such a contract will promote the national security of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Each official named in paragraph (2) shall prescribe acquisition regulations for the agency or agencies under the jurisdiction of such official to promote the use of multiyear contracting as authorized by subsection (a) in a manner that will allow the most efficient use of multiyear contracting.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe the regulations applicable to the Department of Defense.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Contract Cancellations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The regulations may provide for cancellation provisions in multiyear contracts to the extent that such provisions are necessary and in the best interests of the United States. The cancellation provisions may include consideration of both recurring and nonrecurring costs of the contractor associated with the production of the items to be delivered under the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Participation by Subcontractors, Vendors, and Suppliers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In order to broaden the defense industrial base, the regulations shall provide that, to the extent practicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) multiyear contracting under paragraph (1) shall be used in such a manner as to seek, retain, and promote the use under such contracts of companies that are subcontractors, vendors, or suppliers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) upon accrual of any payment or other benefit under such a multiyear contract to any subcontractor, vendor, or supplier company participating in such contract, such payment or benefit shall be delivered to such company in the most expeditious manner practicable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Protection of Existing Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The regulations shall provide that, to the extent practicable, the administration of this section, and of the regulations prescribed under this section, shall not be carried out in a manner to preclude or curtail the existing ability of an agency&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:682 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide for competition in the production of items to be delivered under such a contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide for termination of a prime contract the performance of which is deficient with respect to cost, quality, or schedule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Cancellation or Termination for Insufficient Funding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the event funds are not made available for the continuation of a contract made under this section into a subsequent fiscal year, the contract shall be canceled or terminated. The costs of cancellation or termination may be paid from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) appropriations originally available for the performance of the contract concerned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) appropriations currently available for procurement of the type of property concerned, and not otherwise obligated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) funds appropriated for those payments.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Contract Cancellation Ceilings Exceeding</cap-smallcap> $100,000,000.&mdash;Before any contract described in subsection (a) that contains a clause setting forth a cancellation ceiling in excess of $100,000,000 may be awarded, the head of the agency concerned shall give written notification of the proposed contract and of the proposed cancellation ceiling for that contract to the Committees on Armed Services and on Appropriations of the Senate and House of Representatives, and such contract may not then be awarded until the end of a period of 30 days beginning on the date of such notification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Defense Acquisitions of Weapon Systems</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of the Department of Defense, the authority under subsection (a) includes authority to enter into the following multiyear contracts in accordance with this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A multiyear contract for the purchase of a weapon system, items and services associated with a weapon system, and logistics support for a weapon system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A multiyear contract for advance procurement of components, parts, and materials necessary to the manufacture of a weapon system, including a multiyear contract for such advance procurement that is entered into in order to achieve economic-lot purchases and more efficient production rates.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Defense Acquisitions Specifically Authorized by Law</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A multiyear contract may not be entered into for any fiscal year under this section for a defense acquisition program that has been specifically authorized by law to be carried out using multiyear contract authority unless each of the following conditions is satisfied:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary of Defense certifies to Congress that the current five-year defense program fully funds the support costs associated with the multiyear program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The proposed multiyear contract provides for production at not less than minimum economic rates given the existing tooling and facilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If for any fiscal year a multiyear contract to be entered into under this section is authorized by law for a particular procurement program and that authorization is subject to certain conditions established by law (including a condition as to cost savings to be achieved under the multiyear contract in comparison to specified other contracts) and if it appears (after negotiations with contractors) that such savings cannot be achieved, but that substantial savings could nevertheless be achieved through the use of a multiyear contract rather than specified other contracts, the President may submit to Congress a request for relief from the specified cost savings that must be achieved through multiyear contracting for that program. Any such request by the President shall include details about the request for a multiyear contract, including details about the negotiated contract terms and conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Defense Contract Options for Varying Quantities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense may instruct the Secretary of the military department concerned to incorporate into a proposed multiyear contract negotiated priced options for varying the quantities of end items to be procured over the period of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Inapplicability to Automatic Data Processing Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section does not apply to contracts for the purchase of property to which section 111 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 759) applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l) </em><cap-smallcap>Multiyear Contract Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For the purposes of this subsection, a multiyear contract is a contract for the purchase of property or services for more than one, but not more than five, program years. Such a contract may provide that performance under the contract during the second and subsequent years of the contract is contingent upon the appropriation of funds and (if it does so provide) may provide for a cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if such appropriations are not made.</p>
