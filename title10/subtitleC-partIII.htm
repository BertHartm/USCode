<p class="note-body">This section is included in this chapter without specific reference to statutory source to resolve the ambiguities and conflicts existing in the statutes relating to the appointment of midshipmen at the Naval Academy. The word &ldquo;appoint&rdquo; has been used in various statutes when the intent of Congress was to provide authority in the persons named to &ldquo;choose,&rdquo; &ldquo;select,&rdquo; or &ldquo;nominate&rdquo; for the office of midshipman. These statutes have been collected and codified in &sect;6954 of this title, which reflects the various sources of nominees for &ldquo;appointment&rdquo; as midshipmen and the persons who may so &ldquo;nominate&rdquo; them. The actual appointing power resides in the President and this implied authority is herein expressed for clarity and for the purpose of uniformity of expression.</p>

<p class="note-body">All provisions of law authorizing appointments to the Naval Academy from various sources are collected in this section. The language is extensively changed to meet the needs of this organization of the source material. In those provisions that now authorize &ldquo;appointments&rdquo; by other than the President, the language is changed to indicate that the process is one of selection where the law requires selection by competitive examination, and to show that other candidates are nominated. The manner of appointing the selectees and nominees, in all cases, is covered in &sect;6953 of this title. In the case of nominees from States, the District of Columbia, Territories, and from Puerto Rico, the qualification that the nominees must be from the political subdivisions from which nominated is indicated. The requirement that the nominees be actual residents of the political subdivisions is contained in &sect;6958(b) of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1) the qualification that appointees must be from the sons of members of the various &ldquo;regular&rdquo; components of the armed forces is added, as &ldquo;Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard&rdquo; are so interpreted in this statute.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c) the proviso &ldquo;That all such appointees are otherwise qualified for admission&rdquo; is omitted as covered by &sect;6958 of this title setting forth qualifications of all candidates.</p>
<p class="note-body">The applicability to the United States Military Academy in the Act of June 8, 1926, ch. 492, as amended (34 U.S.C. 1036a; 10 U.S.C. 1091a), was repealed by section 6(c) of the Act of June 30, 1950, ch. 421, 64 Stat. 305.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this chapter, the term &ldquo;hazing&rdquo; means any unauthorized assumption of authority by a midshipman whereby another midshipman suffers or is exposed to any cruelty, indignity, humiliation, hardship, or oppression, or the deprivation or abridgement of any right.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Superintendent of the Naval Academy shall prescribe regulations, to be approved by the Secretary of the Navy, to prevent hazing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Hazing is an offense that may be dealt with as an offense against good order and discipline or as a violation of the regulations of the Naval Academy. However, no midshipman may be dismissed for a single act of hazing except by sentence of a court-martial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The finding and sentence of a court-martial of a midshipman for hazing shall be reviewed in the manner prescribed for general court-martial cases.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A midshipman who is sentenced to imprisonment for hazing may not be confined with persons who have been convicted of crimes or misdemeanors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) A midshipman who is dismissed from the Academy for hazing may not be reappointed as a midshipman or be appointed as a commissioned officer in the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps until two years after the graduation of the class of which he was a member.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;of the Navy&rdquo; are supplied since the requirement that the distribution in ratings be similar to that in the United States Navy Band indicates that the Naval Academy Band should not include members of the Marine Corps, and it is so interpreted.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the words &ldquo;an officer in the grade of warrant officer, W&ndash;1,&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;a warrant officer&rdquo; because the Warrant Officer Act of 1954 established the grade of warrant officer, W&ndash;1, in lieu of all the former warrant officer (as distinguished from commissioned warrant officer) grades. The second sentence covers that part of the second proviso which relates to pay and makes reference to the Career Compensation Act of 1949, since it is that Act which governs entitlement to basic pay and the computation of cumulative years of creditable service. Retirement rights and reenlistment bonuses referred to in the second proviso are covered in the third sentence of this subsection, giving recognition to the fact that the status of the members who are assigned as leader and second leader of the band remains unchanged in these respects.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 4 of the Act of January 16, 1936, ch. 3, 49 Stat. 1092, provided that persons who were then members of the teaching staff should have the right to participate in benefits under the Act if they requested such participation within 60 days. Members who were then under the civil-service retirement system were required to choose whether they would remain under it or would participate in the system established by the 1936 Act. They could not come under both. The section also authorized the Secretary of the Navy to supplement the retired income of members who elected to come under the 1936 Act and whose age in 1936 was such that they could not purchase adequate annuities before retiring. The provisions whereby members could elect to participate were temporary and are executed. The provisions relating to retired income are superseded by &sect;4A, added by the Act of November 28, 1943, ch. 331, 57 Stat. 594. The only remaining effect of &sect;4 and the second proviso of &sect;4A is to exclude from the benefits and requirements of the 1936 Act persons who were members of the teaching staff in 1936 and did not elect to participate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The amount that the Secretary shall pay annually under this section is the difference between the total amount to which the retired member is entitled under subsection (a) and the immediate life annuity to which he is entitled at the time of his disability retirement under the annuity policy required by section 7082 of this title.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1294 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) Each civilian member retired under this section, unless the disability for which he was retired is permanent in character, shall be examined by a board of medical officers designated by the Superintendent of the Naval Academy or of the Postgraduate School, as appropriate, one year after his retirement and annually thereafter, until he becomes 65 years of age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Payments by the Secretary under this section shall be terminated if the retired civilian member is found to be sufficiently recovered for useful and efficient service in his former position and is offered reemployment in that position by the Superintendent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If a civilian member retired under this section is later reemployed by the United States, the payments by the Secretary shall be terminated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Each civilian member retired under this section who is reemployed as a civilian member of the teaching staff of the Naval Academy or the Naval Postgraduate School shall, upon his later retirement, be paid annually by the Secretary the difference between the total annual amount computed under section 7085 of this title and the immediate life annuity which the total premiums paid on his annuity contracts would buy.</p>
