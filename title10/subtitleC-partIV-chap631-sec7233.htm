<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Contracts Required To Be Authorized by Law</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contract may be entered into under subsection (a) with respect to a specific vessel only if the Secretary is specifically authorized by law to enter into such a contract with respect to that vessel.

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Option To Buy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contract entered into under subsection (a) may include options for the United States to purchase one or more of the vessels covered by the contract at any time during, or at the end of, the contract period (including any option period) upon payment of an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the unamortized portion of the cost of the vessel plus amounts incurred in connection with the termination of the financing arrangements associated with the vessel, or (2) the fair market value of the vessel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Domestic Construction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall require in any contract entered into under this section that each vessel to which the contract applies&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The need for the vessels or services to be provided under the contract is expected to remain substantially unchanged during the contemplated contract or option period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) There is a reasonable expectation that throughout the contemplated contract or option period the Secretary of the Navy (or, if the contract is for services to be provided to, and funded by, another military department, the Secretary of that military department) will request funding for the contract at the level required to avoid contract cancellation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The timeliness of consideration of the contract by Congress is such that such a waiver is in the interest of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall submit a notice of any waiver under paragraph (1) to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives.</p>
