<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;a civilian officer or employee of that department, or a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps, as the case may be&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;military personnel or civilian employees of the Department of the Army or of the Army&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;whether under a lease, express or implied&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;consider, ascertain, adjust, determine&rdquo; are omitted as covered by the word &ldquo;settle&rdquo;, as defined in section 2731 of this title. The words &ldquo;arising on or after May 27, 1941&rdquo; are omitted as executed, since, under revised subsection (b), a claim must be filed within one year after it accrues, or within one year after the war is terminated, if it accrues in time of war.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1), the words &ldquo;or loss&rdquo; are inserted before the word &ldquo;incident&rdquo;, for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;it accrues&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;the accident or incident out of which such claim arises shall have occurred&rdquo;, in 31:223b. The words &ldquo;the claim accrues&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;That if such accident or incident occurs&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;not later than&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;within&rdquo; to make it clear that a claim may be presented during a war. The words &ldquo;the war is terminated&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;after peace is established&rdquo;, since the other time covered is &ldquo;time of war&rdquo;. 31:223b (last 49 words of proviso of 2d sentence) is omitted as executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;or section 2672 of title 28&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;claims cognizable under part 2 of this title&rdquo;, to reflect the express amendment of 31:223b and 223c by the fourth clause of section 424(a) of the Federal Tort Claims Act, 60 Stat. 847. Section 424(a) of the Federal Tort Claims Act referred to &ldquo;claims cognizable under part 2 of this title&rdquo;. Part 2 of that act consisted of sections 403 and 404 which were repealed by section 39 of the Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 1008, and replaced by sections 2672 and 2673 of title 28. The words &ldquo;or possessions thereof&rdquo; are omitted, since possessions of foreign countries are not specifically covered by the section to which the words refer.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words &ldquo;claim *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* that would otherwise be covered by this section&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;such claims&rdquo;.</p>
