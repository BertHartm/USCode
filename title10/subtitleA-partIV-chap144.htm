<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress each calendar year, not later than 45 days after the President submits the budget to Congress under section 1105 of title 31, budget justification documents regarding development and procurement schedules for each weapon system for which fund authorization is required by section 114(a) of this title, and for which any funds for procurement are requested in that budget. The documents shall include data on operational testing and evaluation for each weapon system for which funds for procurement are requested (other than funds requested only for the procurement of units for operational testing and evaluation, or long lead-time items, or both). A weapon system shall also be included in the annual documents required under this subsection in each year thereafter until procurement of that system has been completed or terminated, or the Secretary of Defense certifies, in writing, that such inclusion would not serve any useful purpose and gives his reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Any documents required to be submitted under subsection (a) shall include detailed and summarized information with respect to each weapon system covered and shall specifically include each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The development schedule, including estimated annual costs until development is completed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The planned procurement schedule, including the best estimate of the Secretary of Defense of the annual costs and units to be procured until procurement is completed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To the extent required by the second sentence of subsection (a), the result of all operational testing and evaluation up to the time of the submission of the documents, or, if operational testing and evaluation has not been conducted, a statement of the reasons therefor and the results of such other testing and evaluation as has been conducted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) The most efficient production rate, the most efficient acquisition rate, and the minimum sustaining rate, consistent with the program priority established for such weapon system by the Secretary concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In this paragraph:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The term &ldquo;most efficient production rate&rdquo; means the maximum rate for each budget year at which the weapon system can be produced with existing or planned plant capacity and tooling, with one shift a day running for eight hours a day and five days a week.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The term &ldquo;minimum sustaining rate&rdquo; means the production rate for each budget year that is necessary to keep production lines open while maintaining a base of responsive vendors and suppliers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In the case of any weapon system for which procurement funds have not been previously requested and for which funds are first requested by the President in any fiscal year after the Budget for that fiscal year has been submitted to Congress, the same documentation requirements shall be applicable to that system in the same manner and to the same extent as if funds had been requested for that system in that budget.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ballistic Missile Defense Program</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subtitle C of title II of div. A of Pub. L. 104&ndash;106 provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 231. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This subtitle may be cited as the &lsquo;Ballistic Missile Defense Act of 1995&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 232. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The emerging threat that is posed to the national security interests of the United States by the proliferation of ballistic missiles is significant and growing, both in terms of numbers of missiles and in terms of the technical capabilities of those missiles.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The deployment of ballistic missile defenses is a necessary, but not sufficient, element of a broader strategy to discourage both the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the proliferation of the means of their delivery and to defend against the consequences of such proliferation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The deployment of effective Theater Missile Defense systems can deter potential adversaries of the United States from escalating a conflict by threatening or attacking United States forces or the forces or territory of coalition partners or allies of the United States with ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction to offset the operational and technical advantages of the United States and its coalition partners and allies.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) United States intelligence officials have provided intelligence estimates to congressional committees that (A) the trend in missile proliferation is toward longer range and more sophisticated ballistic missiles, (B) North Korea may deploy an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching Alaska or beyond within five years, and (C) although a new, indigenously developed ballistic missile threat to the continental United States is not foreseen within the next ten years, determined countries can acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles in the near future and with little warning by means other than indigenous development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The development and deployment by the United States and its allies of effective defenses against ballistic missiles of all ranges will reduce the incentives for countries to acquire such missiles or to augment existing missile capabilities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The concept of mutual assured destruction (based upon an offense-only form of deterrence), which is the major philosophical rationale underlying the ABM Treaty, is now questionable as a basis for stability in a multipolar world in which the United States and the states of the former Soviet Union are seeking to normalize relations and eliminate Cold War attitudes and arrangements.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The development and deployment of a National Missile Defense system against the threat of limited ballistic missile attacks&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) would strengthen deterrence at the levels of forces agreed to by the United States and Russia under the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks Treaty (START&ndash;I); and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) would further strengthen deterrence if reductions below the levels permitted under START&ndash;I should be agreed to and implemented in the future.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The distinction made during the Cold War, based upon the technology of the time, between strategic ballistic missiles and nonstrategic ballistic missiles, which resulted in the distinction made in the ABM Treaty between strategic defense and nonstrategic defense, has become obsolete because of technological advancement (including the development by North Korea of long-range Taepo-Dong I and Taepo-Dong II missiles) and, therefore, that distinction in the ABM Treaty should be reviewed.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 233. BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to deploy affordable and operationally effective theater missile defenses to protect forward-deployed and expeditionary elements of the Armed Forces of the United States and to complement the missile defense capabilities of forces of coalition partners and of allies of the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to seek a cooperative, negotiated transition to a regime that does not feature an offense-only form of deterrence as the basis for strategic stability.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 234. THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE ARCHITECTURE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Establishment of Core Program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To implement the policy established in paragraph (1) of section <!-- PDFPage:869 -->233, the Secretary of Defense shall restructure the core theater missile defense program to consist of the following systems, to be carried out so as to achieve the specified capabilities:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The Patriot PAC&ndash;3 system, with a first unit equipped (FUE) during fiscal year 1998.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Navy Lower Tier (Area) system, with a user operational evaluation system (UOES) capability during fiscal year 1997 and an initial operational capability (IOC) during fiscal year 1999.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, with a user operational evaluation system (UOES) capability not later than fiscal year 1998 and a first unit equipped (FUE) not later than fiscal year 2000.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The Navy Upper Tier (Theater Wide) system, with a user operational evaluation system (UOES) capability during fiscal year 1999 and an initial operational capability (IOC) during fiscal year 2001.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Use of Streamlined Acquisition Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe and use streamlined acquisition policies and procedures to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of developing and deploying the theater missile defense systems specified in subsection (a).</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Interoperability and Support of Core Systems</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To maximize effectiveness and flexibility of the systems comprising the core theater missile defense program, the Secretary of Defense shall ensure that those systems are integrated and complementary and are fully capable of exploiting external sensor and battle management support from systems such as&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(A) the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) system of the Navy;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) airborne sensors; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) space-based sensors (including, in particular, the Space and Missile Tracking System).</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Follow-on Systems</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall prepare an affordable development plan for theater missile defense systems to be developed as follow-on systems to the core systems specified in subsection (a). The Secretary shall make the selection of a system for inclusion in the plan based on the capability of the system to satisfy military requirements not met by the systems in the core program and on the capability of the system to use prior investments in technologies, infrastructure, and battle-management capabilities that are incorporated in, or associated with, the systems in the core program.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) The Secretary may not proceed with the development of a follow-on theater missile defense system beyond the Demonstration/Validation stage of development unless the Secretary designates that system as a part of the core program under this section and submits to the congressional defense committees [Committees on Armed Services and on Appropriations of the Senate and Committees on National Security and on Appropriations of the House of Representatives] notice of that designation. The Secretary shall include with any such notification a report describing&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(A) the requirements for the system and the specific threats that such system is designed to counter;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) how the system will relate to, support, and build upon existing core systems;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) the planned acquisition strategy for the system; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(D) a preliminary estimate of total program cost for that system and the effect of development and acquisition of such system on Department of Defense budget projections.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) <cap-smallcap>Program Accountability Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) As part of the annual report of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization required by section 224 of Public Law 101&ndash;189 (10 U.S.C. 2431 note), the Secretary of Defense shall describe the technical milestones, the schedule, and the cost of each phase of development and acquisition (together with total estimated program costs) for each core and follow-on theater missile defense program.</p>
