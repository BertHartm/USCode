<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section is based on Pub. L. 99&ndash;190, &sect;101(b) [title VIII, &sect;8009], Dec. 19, 1985, 99 Stat. 1185, 1204.</p>
<p class="note-body">In two instances, the source law to be codified by the bill includes provisions that on their face require that the Department of Defense notify Congress of certain actions. These notification requirements were terminated by section 602 of the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 (Public Law 99&ndash;433), which terminated all recurring reporting requirements applicable to the Department of Defense except for those requirements that were specifically exempted in that section. The source law sections are sections 8009(c) and 8005(j) (proviso) of the FY86 defense appropriations Act (Public Law 99&ndash;190), enacted December 19, 1985, which would be codified as section 2201 of title 10 (by section 1(d) of the bill) and section 7313(a) of title 10 (by section 1(n) of the bill). In codifying the authorities provided the Department of Defense by these two provisions of law, the committee believes that it is appropriate to reinstate the congressional notification requirements that go with those authorities. These sections were recurring annual appropriation provisions <!-- PDFPage:885 -->for many years and were made permanent only months before the enactment of the 1986 Reorganization Act. It is the committee's belief that the failure to exempt these provisions from the general reports termination provision was inadvertent and notes that the notification provisions had in fact previously applied to the Department of Defense for many years. The action of the committee restores the status quo as it existed before the Reorganization Act.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) To conduct economically and efficiently the operations of the Department of Defense that are financed by at least two appropriations but whose costs cannot be immediately distributed and charged to those appropriations, there is the Army Management Fund, the Navy Management Fund, and the Air Force Management Fund, each within its respective department and under the direction of the Secretary of that department. Each such fund shall consist of a corpus of $1,000,000 and such amounts as may be appropriated thereto from time to time. An account for an operation that is to be financed by such a fund may be established only with the approval of the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Under such regulations as the Secretary of Defense may prescribe, expenditures may be made from a management fund for material (other than for stock), personal services, and services under contract. However, obligation may not be incurred against that fund if it is not chargeable to funds available under an appropriation of the department concerned or funds of another department or agency of the Department of Defense. The fund shall be promptly reimbursed from those funds for expenditures made from it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, advances, by check or warrant, or reimbursements, may be made from available appropriations to a management fund on the basis of the estimated cost of a project. As adequate data becomes available, the estimated cost shall be revised and necessary adjustments made. Final adjustment shall be made with the appropriate funds for the fiscal year in which the advances or reimbursements are made. Except as otherwise provided by law, amounts advanced to management funds are available for obligation only during the fiscal year in which they are advanced.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Codification</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 102&ndash;396, title V, Oct. 6, 1992, 106 Stat. 1896, provided that section 1024 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 [H.R. 5006, Pub. L. 102&ndash;484], as it passed the Senate on Oct. 3, 1992, shall be amended in subsection 2218(c)(2) proposed for inclusion in this chapter by deleting all after &ldquo;expended only&rdquo; down to and including &ldquo;appropriations Act&rdquo; and inserting in lieu thereof &ldquo;in amounts authorized by law&rdquo;. It further provided that for purposes of that amendment, Pub. L. 102&ndash;396 shall be treated as having been enacted after Pub. L. 102&ndash;484, regardless of the actual dates of enactment. The date of Oct. 3, 1992, referred to as the date the Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, apparently is based on an order adopted by the Senate on Oct. 3, 1992 [Cong. Rec., vol. 138, p. 30919] providing that when the conference report on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 was received by the Senate from the House of Representatives it would be deemed to have been agreed to. On Oct. 5, 1992, the Senate received the conference report from the House, and it was considered adopted pursuant to that order [Cong. Rec., vol. 138, p. 31565].</p>
