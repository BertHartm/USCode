<h4 class="note-head">1956 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, as amended (5 U.S.C. 411a(a)) which is the National Security Act of 1947, defined &ldquo;Department of the Navy&rdquo;. The Acts of Mar. 5, 1948, ch. 98 (5 U.S.C. 423a(a)), and Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 756 (5 U.S.C. 421g) defined &ldquo;Naval Establishment&rdquo;. The terms &ldquo;Department of the Navy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Naval Establishment&rdquo; are considered to be synonymous. All three definitions were considered, but the phraseology adopted is that of the National Security Act of 1947. The phrase &ldquo;as a service in the Navy&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;as a part of the Navy&rdquo; to conform to the provisions of title 14.</p>
