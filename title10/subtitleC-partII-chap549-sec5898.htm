<p class="statutory-body">(a) If, after reviewing the report of a selection board submitted under section 5897 of this title, the Secretary of the Navy determines that the board has acted contrary to law or regulation, the Secretary shall return the report to the board for further proceedings. Upon receipt of a report returned by the Secretary under this subsection, the selection board (or a subsequent selection board convened under this chapter for the same grade and competitive category) shall conduct such proceedings as may be necessary in order to revise the report and shall resubmit the report, as revised, to the Secretary in accordance with section 5897 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary of the Navy shall, after final review of the report, submit it, together with the Secretary's recommendations, to the Secretary of Defense for transmittal to the President for approval, modification, or disapproval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The name of an officer recommended for promotion by a selection board may be removed from the report of the selection board only by the President. Such action may be taken at any time before the promotion of the officer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Upon approval by the President of the report of a selection board, the names of the officers recommended for promotion by the selection board (other than any name removed by the President) may be disseminated to the armed force concerned. If those names have not been sooner disseminated, those names (other than the name of any officer whose promotion the Senate failed to confirm) shall be promptly disseminated to the armed force concerned upon confirmation by the Senate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Except as authorized or required by this section, proceedings of a selection board convened under this chapter may not be disclosed to any person not a member of the board.</p>
