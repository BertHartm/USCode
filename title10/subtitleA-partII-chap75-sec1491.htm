<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Composition of Honor Guard Details</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of each military department shall ensure that an honor guard detail for the funeral of a veteran consists of not less than three persons and (unless a bugler is part of the detail) <!-- PDFPage:636 -->has the capability to play a recorded version of Taps.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Persons Forming Honor Guards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An honor guard detail may consist of members of the armed forces or members of veterans organizations or other organizations approved for purposes of this section under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of a military department may provide transportation, or reimbursement for transportation, and expenses for a person who participates in an honor guard detail under this section and is not a member of the armed forces or an employee of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall by regulation establish a system for selection of units of the armed forces and other organizations to provide honor guard details. The system shall place an emphasis on balancing the funeral detail workload among the units and organizations providing honor guard details in an equitable manner as they are able to respond to requests for such details in terms of geographic proximity and available resources. The Secretary shall provide in such regulations that the armed force in which a veteran served shall not be considered to be a factor when selecting the military unit or other organization to provide an honor guard detail for the funeral of the veteran.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Annual Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives a report not later than January 31 of each year beginning with 2001 and ending with 2005 on the experience of the Department of Defense under this section. Each such report shall provide data on the number of funerals supported under this section, the cost for that support, shown by manpower and other cost factors, and the number and costs of funerals supported by each participating organization. The data in the report shall be presented in a standard format, regardless of military department or other organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Veteran Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;veteran&rdquo; has the meaning given that term in section 101(2) of title 38.</p>
