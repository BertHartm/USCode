<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Except as provided in subsections (b), (c), and (g) and except in the case of procurement procedures otherwise expressly authorized by statute, the head of an agency in conducting a procurement for property or services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive procedures that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the competitive procedure appropriate under the circumstances, the head of an agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall solicit sealed bids if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) time permits the solicitation, submission, and evaluation of sealed bids;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the award will be made on the basis of price and other price-related factors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) it is not necessary to conduct discussions with the responding sources about their bids; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) there is a reasonable expectation of receiving more than one sealed bid; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall request competitive proposals if sealed bids are not appropriate under clause (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The head of an agency may provide for the procurement of property or services covered by this chapter using competitive procedures but excluding a particular source in order to establish or maintain an alternative source or sources of supply for that property or service if the head of the agency determines that to do so&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:728 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) would increase or maintain competition and would likely result in reduced overall costs for such procurement, or for any anticipated procurement, of property or services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) would be in the interest of national defense in having a facility (or a producer, manufacturer, or other supplier) available for furnishing the property or service in case of a national emergency or industrial mobilization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) would be in the interest of national defense in establishing or maintaining an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) would ensure the continuous availability of a reliable source of supply of such property or service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) would satisfy projected needs for such property or service determined on the basis of a history of high demand for the property or service; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) in the case of medical supplies, safety supplies, or emergency supplies, would satisfy a critical need for such supplies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an agency may provide for the procurement of property or services covered by this section using competitive procedures, but excluding concerns other than small business concerns in furtherance of sections 9 and 15 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638, 644) and concerns other than small business concerns, historically Black colleges and universities, and minority institutions in furtherance of section 2323 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A contract awarded pursuant to the competitive procedures referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not be subject to the justification and approval required by subsection (f)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A determination under paragraph (1) may not be made for a class of purchases or contracts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The head of an agency may use procedures other than competitive procedures only when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the agency's need for the property or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the United States would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order (A) to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing property or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization, (B) to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center, or (C) to procure the services of an expert for use, in any litigation or dispute (including any reasonably foreseeable litigation or dispute) involving the Federal Government, in any trial, hearing, or proceeding before any court, administrative tribunal, or agency, or to procure the services of an expert or neutral for use in any part of an alternative dispute resolution or negotiated rulemaking process, whether or not the expert is expected to testify;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the terms of an international agreement or a treaty between the United States and a foreign government or international organization, or the written directions of a foreign government reimbursing the agency for the cost of the procurement of the property or services for such government, have the effect of requiring the use of procedures other than competitive procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) subject to subsection (j),<sup><a href="#2304_1_target" name="2304_1">1</a></sup> a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the procurement be made through another agency or from a specified source, or the agency's need is for a brand-name commercial item for authorized resale;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the disclosure of the agency's needs would compromise the national security unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the head of the agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) determines that it is necessary in the public interest to use procedures other than competitive procedures in the particular procurement concerned, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) notifies the Congress in writing of such determination not less than 30 days before the award of the contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a contract for property or services to be awarded on the basis of acceptance of an unsolicited research proposal, the property or services shall be considered to be available from only one source if the source has submitted an unsolicited research proposal that demonstrates a concept&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) that is unique and innovative or, in the case of a service, for which the source demonstrates a unique capability of the source to provide the service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the substance of which is not otherwise available to the United States, and does not resemble the substance of a pending competitive procurement; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, or the continued provision of highly specialized services, such property or services may be deemed to be available only from the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) substantial duplication of cost to the United States which is not expected to be recovered through competition; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's needs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the justification is approved&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in the case of a contract for an amount exceeding $500,000 (but equal to or less than $10,000,000), by the competition advocate for the procuring activity (without further delegation) or by an official referred to in clause (ii) or (iii);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in the case of a contract for an amount exceeding $10,000,000 (but equal to or less than $50,000,000), by the head of the procuring activity (or the head of the procuring activity's delegate designated pursuant to paragraph (6)(A)); or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a procurement permitted by subsection (c)(2), the justification and approval required by paragraph (1) may be made after the contract is awarded. The justification and approval required by paragraph (1) is not required&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) when a statute expressly requires that the procurement be made from a specified source;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) in the case of a procurement permitted by subsection (c)(4), but only if the head of the contracting activity prepares a document in connection with such procurement that describes the terms of an agreement or treaty, or the written directions, referred to in that subsection that have the effect of requiring the use of procedures other than competitive procedures and such document is approved by the competition advocate for the procuring activity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(5) In no case may the head of an agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) enter into a contract for property or services using procedures other than competitive procedures on the basis of the lack of advance planning or concerns related to the amount of funds available to the agency for procurement functions; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) procure property or services from another agency unless such other agency complies fully with the requirements of this chapter in its procurement of such property or services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) special simplified procedures for purchases of property and services for amounts greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but not greater than $5,000,000 with respect to which the contracting officer reasonably expects, based on the nature of the property or services sought and on market research, that offers will include only commercial items.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A proposed purchase or contract for an amount above the simplified acquisition threshold may not be divided into several purchases or contracts for lesser amounts in order to use the simplified procedures required by paragraph (1).</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Paragraph (2) does not apply in the case of a solicitation for which the head of the agency concerned determines in writing that, because the services required under the task order contract are unique or highly specialized, it is not practicable to award more than one contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the award of a follow-on contract has been delayed by circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the initial contract was entered into; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the extension is necessary in order to ensure continuity of the receipt of services pending the award of, and commencement of performance under, the follow-on contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A task order contract may be extended under the authority of paragraph (1) only once and only in accordance with the limitations and requirements of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Inapplicability to Certain Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section does not apply to a contract for the acquisition of property or services that includes acquisition of advisory and assistance services if the head of an agency entering into such contract determines that, under the contract, advisory and assistance services are necessarily incident to, and not a significant component of, the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Advisory and Assistance Services Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;advisory and assistance services&rdquo; has the meaning given such term in section 1105(g) of title 31.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1)(A) In preparing for the procurement of property or services, the head of an agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) specify the agency's needs and solicit bids or proposals in a manner designed to achieve full and open competition for the procurement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) use advance procurement planning and market research; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) develop specifications in such manner as is necessary to obtain full and open competition with due regard to the nature of the property or services to be acquired.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Each solicitation under this chapter shall include specifications which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) consistent with the provisions of this chapter, permit full and open competition; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to satisfy the needs of the agency or as authorized by law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For the purposes of subparagraphs (A) and (B), the type of specification included in a solicitation shall depend on the nature of the needs of the agency and the market available to satisfy such needs. Subject to such needs, specifications may be stated in terms of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) function, so that a variety of products or services may qualify;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) performance, including specifications of the range of acceptable characteristics or of the minimum acceptable standards; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) design requirements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to the specifications described in paragraph (1), a solicitation for sealed bids or competitive proposals (other than for a procurement for commercial items using special simplified procedures or a purchase for an amount not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold) shall at a minimum include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a statement of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) all significant factors and significant subfactors which the head of the agency reasonably expects to consider in evaluating sealed bids (including price) or competitive proposals (including cost or price, cost-related or price-related factors and subfactors, and noncost-related or nonprice-related factors and subfactors); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the relative importance assigned to each of those factors and subfactors; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) in the case of sealed bids&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) a statement that sealed bids will be evaluated without discussions with the bidders; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the time and place for submission of proposals.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In prescribing the evaluation factors to be included in each solicitation for competitive proposals, the head of an agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall clearly establish the relative importance assigned to the evaluation factors and subfactors, including the quality of the product or services to be provided (including technical capability, management capability, prior experience, and past performance of the offeror);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) shall include cost or price to the Federal Government as an evaluation factor that must be considered in the evaluation of proposals; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) approximately equal in importance to cost or price; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) significantly less important than cost or price.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The regulations implementing clause (iii) of subparagraph (A) may not define the terms &ldquo;significantly more important&rdquo; and &ldquo;significantly less important&rdquo; as specific numeric weights that would be applied uniformly to all solicitations or a class of solicitations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subsection prohibits an agency from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) providing additional information in a solicitation, including numeric weights for all evaluation factors and subfactors on a case-by-case basis; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) stating in a solicitation that award will be made to the offeror that meets the solicitation's mandatory requirements at the lowest cost or price.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The head of an agency, in issuing a solicitation for a contract to be awarded using sealed bid procedures, may not include in such solicitation a clause providing for the evaluation of prices for options to purchase additional property or services under the contract unless the head of the agency has determined that there is a reasonable likelihood that the options will be exercised.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The head of an agency shall evaluate sealed bids and competitive proposals and make an award based solely on the factors specified in the solicitation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) All sealed bids or competitive proposals received in response to a solicitation may be rejected if the head of the agency determines that such action is in the public interest.</p>

The head of the agency shall evaluate the bids in accordance with paragraph (1) without discussions with the bidders and, except as provided in paragraph (2), shall award a contract with reasonable promptness to the responsible bidder whose bid conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the United States, considering only price and the other price-related factors included in the solicitation. The award of a contract shall be made by transmitting, in writing or by electronic means, notice of the award to the successful bidder. Within three days after the date of contract award, the head of the agency shall notify, in writing or by electronic means, each bidder not awarded the contract that the contract has been awarded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The head of an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals in accordance with paragraph (1) and may award a contract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) after discussions with the offerors, provided that written or oral discussions have been conducted with all responsible offerors who submit proposals within the competitive range; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) based on the proposals received, without discussions with the offerors (other than discussions conducted for the purpose of minor clarification) provided that the solicitation included a statement that proposals are intended to be evaluated, and award made, without discussions, unless discussions are determined to be necessary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the contracting officer determines that the number of offerors that would otherwise be included in the competitive range under subparagraph (A)(i) exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range, in accordance with the criteria specified in the solicitation, to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the offerors rated most highly in accordance with such criteria.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the head of the agency shall award a contract with reasonable promptness to the responsible source whose proposal is most advantageous to the United States, considering only cost or price and the other factors included in the solicitation. The head of the agency shall award the contract by transmitting, in writing or by electronic means, notice of the award to such source and, within three days after the date of contract award, shall notify, in writing or by electronic means, all other offerors of the rejection of their proposals. This subparagraph does not apply with respect to the award of a contract for the acquisition of perishable subsistence items.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) When a contract is awarded by the head of an agency on the basis of competitive proposals, an unsuccessful offeror, upon written request received by the agency within 3 days after the date on which the unsuccessful offeror receives the notification of the contract award, shall be debriefed and furnished the basis for the selection decision and contract award. The head of the agency shall debrief the offeror within, to the maximum extent practicable, five days after receipt of the request by the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The debriefing shall include, at a minimum&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the offeror's offer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the overall evaluated cost and technical rating of the offer of the contractor awarded the contract and the overall evaluated cost and technical rating of the offer of the debriefed offeror;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the overall ranking of all offers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) a summary of the rationale for the award;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) in the case of a proposal that includes a commercial item that is an end item under the contract, the make and model of the item being provided in accordance with the offer of the contractor awarded the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The debriefing may not include point-by-point comparisons of the debriefed offeror's offer with other offers and may not disclose any information that is exempt from disclosure under section 552(b) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Each solicitation for competitive proposals shall include a statement that information described in subparagraph (B) may be disclosed in post-award debriefings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) If, within one year after the date of the contract award and as a result of a successful procurement protest, the agency seeks to fulfill the requirement under the protested contract either on the basis of a new solicitation of offers or on the basis of new best and final offers requested for that contract, the agency shall make available to all offerors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the information provided in debriefings under this paragraph regarding the offer of the contractor awarded the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the same information that would have been provided to the original offerors.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2305a. Design-build selection procedures</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Authorization</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Unless the traditional acquisition approach of design-bid-build established under the Brooks Architect-Engineers Act (41 U.S.C. 541 et seq.)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2305a_1_target" name="2305a_1">1</a></sup> is used or another acquisition procedure authorized by law is used, the head of an agency shall use the two-phase selection procedures authorized in this section for entering into a contract for the design and construction of a public building, facility, or work when a determination is made under subsection (b) that the procedures are appropriate for use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Criteria for Use</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contracting officer shall make a determination whether two-phase selection procedures are appropriate for use for entering into a contract for the design and construction of a public building, facility, or work when the contracting officer anticipates that three or more offers will be received for such contract, design work must be performed before an offeror can develop a price or cost proposal for such contract, the offeror will incur a substantial amount of expense in preparing the offer, and the contracting officer has considered information such as the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The extent to which the project requirements have been adequately defined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The time constraints for delivery of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The capability and experience of potential contractors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The suitability of the project for use of the two-phase selection procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The capability of the agency to manage the two-phase selection process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Other criteria established by the agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Procedures Described</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Two-phase selection procedures consist of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The agency develops, either in-house or by contract, a scope of work statement for inclusion in the solicitation that defines the project and provides prospective offerors with sufficient information regarding the Govern<!-- PDFPage:747 -->ment's requirements (which may include criteria and preliminary design, budget parameters, and schedule or delivery requirements) to enable the offerors to submit proposals which meet the Government's needs. If the agency contracts for development of the scope of work statement, the agency shall contract for architectural and engineering services as defined by and in accordance with the Brooks Architect-Engineers Act (40 U.S.C. 541 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The contracting officer solicits phase-one proposals that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) include information on the offeror's&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) technical approach; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) technical qualifications; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) do not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) detailed design information; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) cost or price information.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The evaluation factors to be used in evaluating phase-one proposals are stated in the solicitation and include specialized experience and technical competence, capability to perform, past performance of the offeror's team (including the architect-engineer and construction members of the team) and other appropriate factors, except that cost-related or price-related evaluation factors are not permitted. Each solicitation establishes the relative importance assigned to the evaluation factors and subfactors that must be considered in the evaluation of phase-one proposals. The agency evaluates phase-one proposals on the basis of the phase-one evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The contracting officer selects as the most highly qualified the number of offerors specified in the solicitation to provide the property or services under the contract and requests the selected offerors to submit phase-two competitive proposals that include technical proposals and cost or price information. Each solicitation establishes with respect to phase two&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the technical submission for the proposal, including design concepts or proposed solutions to requirements addressed within the scope of work (or both), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the evaluation factors and subfactors, including cost or price, that must be considered in the evaluations of proposals in accordance with paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of section 2305(a) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The contracting officer separately evaluates the submissions described in subparagraphs (A) and (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The agency awards the contract in accordance with section 2305(b)(4) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Solicitation to State Number of Offerors To Be Selected for Phase Two Requests for Competitive Proposals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A solicitation issued pursuant to the procedures described in subsection (c) shall state the maximum number of offerors that are to be selected to submit competitive proposals pursuant to subsection (c)(4). The maximum number specified in the solicitation shall not exceed 5 unless the agency determines with respect to an individual solicitation that a specified number greater than 5 is in the Government's interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of the two-phase selection process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Requirement for Guidance and Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include guidance&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) regarding the factors that may be considered in determining whether the two-phase contracting procedures authorized by subsection (a) are appropriate for use in individual contracting situations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) regarding the factors that may be used in selecting contractors; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) providing for a uniform approach to be used Government-wide.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost system of contracting may not be used. Subject to the limitation in the preceding sentence, the other provisions of this section, and other applicable provisions of law, the head of an agency, in awarding contracts under this chapter after using procedures other than sealed-bid procedures, may enter into any kind of contract that he considers will promote the best interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Each contract awarded under this chapter after using procedures other than sealed-bid procedures shall contain a warranty, determined to be suitable by the head of the agency, that the contractor has employed or retained no person or selling agency to solicit or obtain the contract under an understanding or agreement for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee, except a bona fide employee or established commercial or selling agency maintained by him to obtain business. If a contractor breaks such a warranty the United States may annul the contract without liability or may deduct the commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee from the contract price or consideration. This subsection does not apply to a contract that is for an amount not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold or to a contract for the acquisition of commercial items.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">[(c) Repealed. Pub. L. 103&ndash;355, title I, &sect;1021, Oct. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 3257.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The fee for performing a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract for experimental, developmental, or research work may not be more than 15 percent <!-- PDFPage:748 -->of the estimated cost of the contract, not including the fee. The fee for performing a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract for architectural or engineering services for a public work or utility plus the cost of those services to the contractor may not be more than 6 percent of the estimated cost of that work or project, not including fees. The fee for performing any other cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract may not be more than 10 percent of the estimated cost of the contract, not including the fee. Determinations under this subsection of the estimated costs of a contract or project shall be made by the head of the agency at the time the contract is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Each cost contract and each cost-plus-a- fixed-fee contract shall provide for notice to the agency by the contractor before the making, under the prime contract, of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee subcontract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a fixed-price subcontract or purchase order involving more than the greater of (A) the simplified acquisition threshold, or (B) 5 percent of the estimated cost of the prime contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) So-called &ldquo;truth-in-negotiations&rdquo; provisions relating to cost or pricing data to be submitted by certain contractors and subcontractors are provided in section 2306a of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) The head of an agency may enter into contracts for periods of not more than five years for the following types of services (and items of supply related to such services) for which funds would otherwise be available for obligation only within the fiscal year for which appropriated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) operation, maintenance, and support of facilities and installations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) maintenance or modification of aircraft, ships, vehicles, and other highly complex military equipment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) specialized training necessitating high quality instructor skills (for example, pilot and aircrew members; foreign language training); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) base services (for example, ground maintenance; in-plane refueling; bus transportation; refuse collection and disposal);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">whenever he finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) there will be a continuing requirement for the services consonant with current plans for the proposed contract period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the furnishing of such services will require a substantial initial investment in plant or equipment, or the incurrence of substantial contingent liabilities for the assembly, training, or transportation of a specialized work force; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the use of such a contract will promote the best interests of the United States by encouraging effective competition and promoting economies in operation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In entering into such contracts, the head of the agency shall be guided by the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The portion of the cost of any plant or equipment amortized as a cost of contract performance should not exceed the ratio between the period of contract performance and the anticipated useful commercial life of such plant or equipment. Useful commercial life, for this purpose, means the commercial utility of the facilities rather than the physical life thereof, with due consideration given to such factors as location of facilities, specialized nature thereof, and obsolescence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Consideration shall be given to the desirability of obtaining an option to renew the contract for a reasonable period not to exceed three years, at prices not to include charges for plant, equipment and other nonrecurring costs, already amortized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Consideration shall be given to the desirability of reserving in the agency the right, upon payment of the unamortized portion of the cost of the plant or equipment, to take title thereto under appropriate circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the event funds are not made available for the continuation of such a contract into a subsequent fiscal year, the contract shall be canceled or terminated, and the costs of cancellation or termination may be paid from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) appropriations originally available for the performance of the contract concerned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) appropriations currently available for procurement of the type of services concerned, and not otherwise obligated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) funds appropriated for those payments.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2306b. Multiyear contracts</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To the extent that funds are otherwise available for obligation, the head of an agency may enter into multiyear contracts for the purchase of property whenever the head of that agency finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the use of such a contract will result in substantial savings of the total anticipated costs of carrying out the program through annual contracts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that the minimum need for the property to be purchased is expected to remain substantially unchanged during the contemplated contract period in terms of production rate, procurement rate, and total quantities;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:756 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that there is a reasonable expectation that throughout the contemplated contract period the head of the agency will request funding for the contract at the level required to avoid contract cancellation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that there is a stable design for the property to be acquired and that the technical risks associated with such property are not excessive;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) that the estimates of both the cost of the contract and the anticipated cost avoidance through the use of a multiyear contract are realistic; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) in the case of a purchase by the Department of Defense, that the use of such a contract will promote the national security of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Each official named in paragraph (2) shall prescribe acquisition regulations for the agency or agencies under the jurisdiction of such official to promote the use of multiyear contracting as authorized by subsection (a) in a manner that will allow the most efficient use of multiyear contracting.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe the regulations applicable to the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe the regulations applicable to the Coast Guard, except that the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense shall apply to the Coast Guard when it is operating as a service in the Navy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall prescribe the regulations applicable to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Contract Cancellations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The regulations may provide for cancellation provisions in multiyear contracts to the extent that such provisions are necessary and in the best interests of the United States. The cancellation provisions may include consideration of both recurring and nonrecurring costs of the contractor associated with the production of the items to be delivered under the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Participation by Subcontractors, Vendors, and Suppliers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In order to broaden the defense industrial base, the regulations shall provide that, to the extent practicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) multiyear contracting under paragraph (1) shall be used in such a manner as to seek, retain, and promote the use under such contracts of companies that are subcontractors, vendors, or suppliers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) upon accrual of any payment or other benefit under such a multiyear contract to any subcontractor, vendor, or supplier company participating in such contract, such payment or benefit shall be delivered to such company in the most expeditious manner practicable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Protection of Existing Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The regulations shall provide that, to the extent practicable, the administration of this section, and of the regulations prescribed under this section, shall not be carried out in a manner to preclude or curtail the existing ability of an agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide for competition in the production of items to be delivered under such a contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide for termination of a prime contract the performance of which is deficient with respect to cost, quality, or schedule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Cancellation or Termination for Insufficient Funding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the event funds are not made available for the continuation of a contract made under this section into a subsequent fiscal year, the contract shall be canceled or terminated. The costs of cancellation or termination may be paid from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) appropriations originally available for the performance of the contract concerned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) appropriations currently available for procurement of the type of property concerned, and not otherwise obligated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) funds appropriated for those payments.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Contract Cancellation Ceilings Exceeding</cap-smallcap> $100,000,000.&mdash;Before any contract described in subsection (a) that contains a clause setting forth a cancellation ceiling in excess of $100,000,000 may be awarded, the head of the agency concerned shall give written notification of the proposed contract and of the proposed cancellation ceiling for that contract to the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on National Security and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives, and such contract may not then be awarded until the end of a period of 30 days beginning on the date of such notification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Defense Acquisitions of Weapon Systems</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of the Department of Defense, the authority under subsection (a) includes authority to enter into the following multiyear contracts in accordance with this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A multiyear contract for the purchase of a weapon system, items and services associated with a weapon system, and logistics support for a weapon system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A multiyear contract for advance procurement of components, parts, and materials necessary to the manufacture of a weapon system, including a multiyear contract for such advance procurement that is entered into in order to achieve economic-lot purchases and more efficient production rates.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Defense Acquisitions Specifically Authorized by Law</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A multiyear contract may not be entered into for any fiscal year under this section for a defense acquisition program that has been specifically authorized by law to be carried out using multiyear contract authority unless each of the following conditions is satisfied:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary of Defense certifies to Congress that the current five-year defense program fully funds the support costs associated with the multiyear program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The proposed multiyear contract provides for production at not less than minimum economic rates given the existing tooling and facilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If for any fiscal year a multiyear contract to be entered into under this section is authorized by law for a particular procurement program and that authorization is subject to certain conditions established by law (including a <!-- PDFPage:757 -->condition as to cost savings to be achieved under the multiyear contract in comparison to specified other contracts) and if it appears (after negotiations with contractors) that such savings cannot be achieved, but that substantial savings could nevertheless be achieved through the use of a multiyear contract rather than specified other contracts, the President may submit to Congress a request for relief from the specified cost savings that must be achieved through multiyear contracting for that program. Any such request by the President shall include details about the request for a multiyear contract, including details about the negotiated contract terms and conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Defense Contract Options for Varying Quantities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense may instruct the Secretary of the military department concerned to incorporate into a proposed multiyear contract negotiated priced options for varying the quantities of end items to be procured over the period of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Multiyear Contract Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For the purposes of this subsection, a multiyear contract is a contract for the purchase of property or services for more than one, but not more than five, program years. Such a contract may provide that performance under the contract during the second and subsequent years of the contract is contingent upon the appropriation of funds and (if it does so provide) may provide for a cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if such appropriations are not made.</p>

Such security may be in the form of a lien in favor of the United States on the property contracted for, on the balance in an account in which such payments are deposited, and on such of the property acquired for performance of the contract as the parties may agree. This lien is paramount to any other liens and is effective immediately upon the first advancement of funds without filing, notice, or any other action by the United States.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section, the term &ldquo;qualification requirement&rdquo; means a requirement for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be completed by an offeror before award of a contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Except as provided in subsection (c), the head of the agency shall, before establishing a qualification requirement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prepare a written justification stating the necessity for establishing the qualification requirement and specify why the qualification requirement must be demonstrated before contract award;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) specify in writing and make available to a potential offeror upon request all requirements which a prospective offeror, or its product, must satisfy in order to become qualified, such requirements to be limited to those least restrictive to meet the purposes necessitating the establishment of the qualification requirement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) specify an estimate of the costs of testing and evaluation likely to be incurred by a potential offeror in order to become qualified;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) ensure that a potential offeror is provided, upon request and on a reimbursable basis, a prompt opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification using qualified personnel and facilities of the agency concerned or of another agency obtained through interagency agreement, or under contract, or other methods approved by the agency (including use of approved testing and evaluation services not provided under contract to the agency);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) if testing and evaluation services are provided under contract to the agency for the purposes of clause (4), provide to the extent possible that such services be provided by a contractor who is not expected to benefit from an absence of additional qualified sources and who shall be required in such contract to adhere to any restriction on technical data asserted by the potential offeror seeking qualification; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) ensure that a potential offeror seeking qualification is promptly informed as to whether qualification is attained and, in the event qualification is not attained, is promptly furnished specific information why qualification was not attained.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply with respect to a qualification requirement established by statute or administrative action before October 19, 1984, unless such requirement is a qualified products list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), if it is unreasonable to specify the standards for qualification which a prospective offeror or its product must satisfy, a determination to that effect shall be submitted to the advocate for competition of the procuring activity responsible for the purchase of the item subject to the qualification requirement. After considering any comments of the advocate for competition reviewing such determination, the head of the purchasing office may waive the requirements of clauses (2) through (6) of subsection (b) for up to two years with respect to the item subject to the qualification requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The waiver authority provided in this paragraph does not apply with respect to a qualified products list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A potential offeror may not be denied the opportunity to submit and have considered an offer for a contract solely because the potential offeror (A) is not on a qualified bidders list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified products list, or (B) has not been identified as meeting a qualification requirement established after October 19, 1984, if the potential offeror can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the contracting officer that the potential offeror or its product meets the standards established for qualification or can meet such standards before the date specified for award of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing contained in this subsection requires the referral of an offer to the Small Business Administration pursuant to section 8(b)(7) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(b)(7)) if the basis for the referral is a challenge by the offeror to either the validity of the qualification requirement or the offeror's compliance with such requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The head of an agency need not delay a proposed procurement in order to comply with subsection (b) or in order to provide a potential offeror with an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The requirements of subsection (b) also apply before enforcement of any qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) If the number of qualified sources or qualified products available to compete actively for an anticipated future requirement is fewer than two actual manufacturers or the products of two actual manufacturers, respectively, the head of the agency concerned shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) periodically publish notice in the Commerce Business Daily soliciting additional sources or products to seek qualification, unless the contracting officer determines that such publication would compromise national security; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) bear the cost of conducting the specified testing and evaluation (excluding the costs associated with producing the item or establishing the production, quality control, or other system to be tested and evaluated) for a small business concern or a product manufactured by a small business concern which has met the standards specified for qualification and which could reasonably be expected to compete for a contract for that requirement, but such costs may be borne only if the head of the agency determines that such additional qualified sources or products are likely to result in cost savings from increased competition for future requirements sufficient to amortize the costs incurred by the agency within a reasonable period of time considering the duration and dollar value of anticipated future requirements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an agency shall require a prospective contractor requesting the United States to bear testing and evaluation costs under paragraph (1)(B) to certify as to its status as a small business concern under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Within seven years after the establishment of a qualification requirement under subsection <!-- PDFPage:767 -->(b) or within seven years following an agency's enforcement of a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list, any such qualification requirement shall be examined and revalidated in accordance with the requirements of subsection (b). The preceding sentence does not apply in the case of a qualification requirement for which a waiver is in effect under subsection (c)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Except in an emergency as determined by the head of the agency, whenever the head of the agency determines not to enforce a qualification requirement for a solicitation, the agency may not thereafter enforce that qualification requirement unless the agency complies with the requirements of subsection (b).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2320. Rights in technical data</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to define the legitimate interest of the United States and of a contractor or subcontractor in technical data pertaining to an item or process. Such regulations shall be included in regulations of the Department of Defense prescribed as part of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Such regulations may not impair any right of the United States or of any contractor or subcontractor with respect to patents or copyrights or any other right in technical data otherwise established by law. Such regulations also may not impair the right of a contractor or subcontractor to receive from a third party a fee or royalty for the use of technical data pertaining to an item or process developed exclusively at private expense by the contractor or subcontractor, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such regulations shall include the following provisions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the case of an item or process that is developed by a contractor or subcontractor exclusively with Federal funds (other than an item or process developed under a contract or subcontract to which regulations under section 9(j)(2) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638(j)(2)) apply), the United States shall have the unlimited right to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) use technical data pertaining to the item or process; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) release or disclose the technical data to persons outside the government or permit the use of the technical data by such persons.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Except as provided in subparagraphs (C) and (D), in the case of an item or process that is developed by a contractor or subcontractor exclusively at private expense, the contractor or subcontractor may restrict the right of the United States to release or disclose technical data pertaining to the item or process to persons outside the government or permit the use of the technical data by such persons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Subparagraph (B) does not apply to technical data that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) constitutes a correction or change to data furnished by the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) relates to form, fit, or function;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) is necessary for operation, maintenance, installation, or training (other than detailed manufacturing or process data); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) is otherwise publicly available or has been released or disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor without restriction on further release or disclosure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Notwithstanding subparagraph (B), the United States may release or disclose technical data to persons outside the Government, or permit the use of technical data by such persons, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such release, disclosure, or use&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) is necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) is a release or disclosure of technical data (other than detailed manufacturing or process data) to, or use of such data by, a foreign government that is in the interest of the United States and is required for evaluational or informational purposes;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such release, disclosure, or use is made subject to a prohibition that the person to whom the data is released or disclosed may not further release, disclose, or use such data; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is notified of such release, disclosure, or use.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) In the case of an item or process that is developed in part with Federal funds and in part at private expense, the respective rights of the United States and of the contractor or subcontractor in technical data pertaining to such item or process shall be established as early in the acquisition process as practicable (preferably during contract negotiations) and shall be based upon negotiations between the United States and the contractor, except in any case in which the Secretary of Defense determines, on the basis of criteria established in the regulations, that negotiations would not be practicable. The establishment of such rights shall be based upon consideration of all of the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The statement of congressional policy and objectives in section 200 of title 35, the statement of purposes in section 2(b) of the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 (15 U.S.C. 638 note), and the declaration of policy in section 2 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:768 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The interest of the United States in increasing competition and lowering costs by developing and locating alternative sources of supply and manufacture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The interest of the United States in encouraging contractors to develop at private expense items for use by the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) Such other factors as the Secretary of Defense may prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) A contractor or subcontractor (or a prospective contractor or subcontractor) may not be required, as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for the award of a contract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to sell or otherwise relinquish to the United States any rights in technical data except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) rights in technical data described in subparagraph (C); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) under the conditions described in subparagraph (D); or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to refrain from offering to use, or from using, an item or process to which the contractor is entitled to restrict rights in data under subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) The Secretary of Defense may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) negotiate and enter into a contract with a contractor or subcontractor for the acquisition of rights in technical data not otherwise provided under subparagraph (C) or (D), if necessary to develop alternative sources of supply and manufacture;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) agree to restrict rights in technical data otherwise accorded to the United States under this section if the United States receives a royalty-free license to use, release, or disclose the data for purposes of the United States (including purposes of competitive procurement); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) permit a contractor or subcontractor to license directly to a third party the use of technical data which the contractor is otherwise allowed to restrict, if necessary to develop alternative sources of supply and manufacture.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Defense shall define the terms &ldquo;developed&rdquo;, &ldquo;exclusively with Federal funds&rdquo;, and &ldquo;exclusively at private expense&rdquo; in regulations prescribed under paragraph (1). In defining such terms, the Secretary shall specify the manner in which indirect costs shall be treated and shall specify that amounts spent for independent research and development and bid and proposal costs shall not be considered to be Federal funds for the purposes of definitions under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Regulations prescribed under subsection (a) shall require that, whenever practicable, a contract for supplies or services entered into by an agency named in section 2303 of this title contain appropriate provisions relating to technical data, including provisions&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) defining the respective rights of the United States and the contractor or subcontractor (at any tier) regarding any technical data to be delivered under the contract and providing that, in the case of a contract for a commercial item, the item shall be presumed to be developed at private expense unless shown otherwise in accordance with section 2321(f);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) specifying the technical data, if any, to be delivered under the contract and delivery schedules for such delivery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) establishing or referencing procedures for determining the acceptability of technical data to be delivered under the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) establishing separate contract line items for the technical data, if any, to be delivered under the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to the maximum practicable extent, identifying, in advance of delivery, technical data which is to be delivered with restrictions on the right of the United States to use such data;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) requiring the contractor to revise any technical data delivered under the contract to reflect engineering design changes made during the performance of the contract and affecting the form, fit, and function of the items specified in the contract and to deliver such revised technical data to an agency within a time specified in the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) requiring the contractor to furnish written assurance at the time the technical data is delivered or is made available that the technical data is complete and accurate and satisfies the requirements of the contract concerning technical data;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) establishing remedies to be available to the United States when technical data required to be delivered or made available under the contract is found to be incomplete or inadequate or to not satisfy the requirements of the contract concerning technical data; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) authorizing the head of the agency to withhold payments under the contract (or exercise such other remedies as the head of the agency considers appropriate) during any period if the contractor does not meet the requirements of the contract pertaining to the delivery of technical data.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Nothing in this section or in section 2305(d) of this title prohibits the Secretary of Defense from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prescribing standards for determining whether a contract entered into by the Department of Defense shall provide for a time to be specified in the contract after which the United States shall have the right to use (or have used) for any purpose of the United States all technical data required to be delivered to the United States under the contract or providing for such a period of time (not to exceed 7 years) as a negotiation objective; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) prescribing reasonable and flexible guidelines, including negotiation objectives, for the conduct of negotiations regarding the respective rights in technical data of the United States and the contractor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary of Defense shall by regulation establish programs which provide domestic business concerns an opportunity to purchase or borrow replenishment parts from the United States for the purpose of design replication or modification, to be used by such concerns in the submission of subsequent offers to sell the same or like parts to the United States. Nothing in <!-- PDFPage:769 -->this subsection limits the authority of the head of an agency to impose restrictions on such a program related to national security considerations, inventory needs of the United States, the improbability of future purchases of the same or like parts, or any additional restriction otherwise required by law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Contracts Covered by Section</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section applies to any contract for supplies or services entered into by the Department of Defense that includes provisions for the delivery of technical data.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Contractor Justification for Restrictions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contract subject to this section shall provide that a contractor under the contract and any subcontractor under the contract at any tier shall be prepared to furnish to the contracting officer a written justification for any use or release restriction (as defined in subsection (i)) asserted by the contractor or subcontractor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Review of Restrictions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that there is a thorough review of the appropriateness of any use or release restriction asserted with respect to technical data by a contractor or subcontractor at any tier under a contract subject to this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The review of an asserted use or release restriction under paragraph (1) shall be conducted <!-- PDFPage:771 -->before the end of the three-year period beginning on the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date on which final payment is made on the contract under which the technical data is required to be delivered; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the date on which the technical data is delivered under the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Challenges to Restrictions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense may challenge a use or release restriction asserted with respect to technical data by a contractor or subcontractor at any tier under a contract subject to this section if the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reasonable grounds exist to question the current validity of the asserted restriction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the continued adherence by the United States to the asserted restriction would make it impracticable to procure the item to which the technical data pertain competitively at a later time.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A challenge to an asserted use or release restriction may not be made under paragraph (1) after the end of the three-year period described in subparagraph (B) unless the technical data involved&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) are publicly available;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) have been furnished to the United States without restriction; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) have been otherwise made available without restriction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The three-year period referred to in subparagraph (A) is the three-year period beginning on the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the date on which final payment is made on the contract under which the technical data are required to be delivered; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the date on which the technical data are delivered under the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Secretary challenges an asserted use or release restriction under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall provide written notice of the challenge to the contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction. Any such notice shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) state the specific grounds for challenging the asserted restriction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) require a response within 60 days justifying the current validity of the asserted restriction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) state that evidence of a justification described in paragraph (4) may be submitted.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) It is a justification of an asserted use or release restriction challenged under paragraph (1) that, within the three-year period preceding the challenge to the restriction, the Department of Defense validated a restriction identical to the asserted restriction if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such validation occurred after a challenge to the validated restriction under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the validated restriction was asserted by the same contractor or subcontractor (or a licensee of such contractor or subcontractor).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Time for Contractors to Submit Justifications</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a contractor or subcontractor asserting a use or release restriction submits to the contracting officer a written request, showing the need for additional time to comply with the requirement to justify the current validity of the asserted restriction, additional time to adequately permit the submission of such justification shall be provided by the contracting officer as appropriate. If a party asserting a restriction receives notices of challenges to restrictions on technical data from more than one contracting officer, and notifies each contracting officer of the existence of more than one challenge, the contracting officer initiating the first in time challenge, after consultation with the party asserting the restriction and the other contracting officers, shall formulate a schedule of responses to each of the challenges that will afford the party asserting the restriction with an equitable opportunity to respond to each such challenge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Presumption of Development Exclusively at Private Expense for Commercial Items Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of a challenge to a use or release restriction that is asserted with respect to technical data of a contractor or subcontractor under a contract for commercial items, the contracting officer shall presume that the contractor or subcontractor has justified the restriction on the basis that the item was developed exclusively at private expense, whether or not the contractor or subcontractor submits a justification in response to the notice provided pursuant to subsection (d)(3). In such a case, the challenge to the use or release restriction may be sustained only if information provided by the Department of Defense demonstrates that the item was not developed exclusively at private expense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Decision by Contracting Officer</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Upon a failure by the contractor or subcontractor to submit any response under subsection (d)(3), the contracting officer shall issue a decision pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After review of any justification submitted in response to the notice provided pursuant to subsection (d)(3), the contracting officer shall, within 60 days of receipt of any justification submitted, issue a decision or notify the party asserting the restriction of the time within which a decision will be issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Claims</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a claim pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction is submitted in writing to a contracting officer by a contractor or subcontractor at any tier, such claim shall be considered a claim within the meaning of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Rights and Liability Upon Final Disposition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If, upon final disposition, the contracting officer's challenge to the use or release restriction is sustained&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the restriction shall be cancelled; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the asserted restriction is found not to be substantially justified, the contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction shall be liable to the United States for payment of the cost to the United States of reviewing the asserted restriction and the fees and other expenses (as defined in section 2412(d)(2)(A) of title 28) incurred by the United States in challenging the asserted restriction, unless special circumstances would make such payment unjust.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:772 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) If, upon final disposition, the contracting officer's challenge to the use or release restriction is not sustained&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the United States shall continue to be bound by the restriction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the United States shall be liable for payment to the party asserting the restriction for fees and other expenses (as defined in section 2412(d)(2)(A) of title 28) incurred by the party asserting the restriction in defending the asserted restriction if the challenge by the United States is found not to be made in good faith.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Use or Release Restriction Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;use or release restriction&rdquo;, with respect to technical data delivered to the United States under a contract subject to this section, means a restriction by the contractor or subcontractor on the right of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to use such technical data; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to release or disclose such technical data to persons outside the Government or permit the use of such technical data by persons outside the Government.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) historically Black colleges and universities, including any nonprofit research institution that was an integral part of such a college or university before November 14, 1986; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) minority institutions (as defined in section 1046(3) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1135d&ndash;5(3))), which, for the purposes of this section, shall include Hispanic-serving institutions (as defined in section 316(b)(1) of such Act (20 U.S.C. 1059c(b)(1))).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of the agency shall establish a specific goal within the overall 5 percent goal for the award of prime contracts and subcontracts to historically Black colleges and universities and minority institutions in order to increase the participation of such colleges and universities in the program provided for by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide procedures or guidelines for contracting officers to set goals which agency prime contractors that are required to submit subcontracting plans under section 8(d)(4)(B) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(B)) in furtherance of the agency's program to meet the 5 percent goal specified in paragraph (1) should meet in awarding subcontracts, including subcontracts to minority-owned media, to entities described in that paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Technical assistance provided under this section shall include information about the program, advice about agency procurement procedures, instruction in preparation of proposals, and other such assistance as the head of the agency considers appropriate. If the resources of the agency are inadequate to provide such assistance, the head of the agency may enter into contracts with minority private sector entities with experience and expertise in the design, development, and delivery of technical assistance services to eligible individuals, business firms and institutions, acquisition agencies, and prime contractors. Agency contracts with such entities shall be awarded annually, based upon, among other things, the number of minority small business concerns, historically Black colleges and universities, and minority institutions that each such entity brings into the program.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Attract and retain faculty involved in scientific disciplines critical to the national security functions of the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Equip and renovate laboratories for the performance of defense research.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) Expand and equip Reserve Officer Training Corps activities devoted to scientific disciplines critical to the national security functions of the Department of Defense.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Applicability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subsection (a) does not apply to the Department of Defense&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to the extent to which the Secretary of Defense determines that compelling national security considerations require otherwise; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the Secretary notifies Congress of such determination and the reasons for such determination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Competitive Procedures and Advance Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To attain the goal of subsection (a):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) The head of the agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) ensure that substantial progress is made in increasing awards of agency contracts to entities described in subsection (a)(1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) exercise his utmost authority, resourcefulness, and diligence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) in the case of the Department of Defense, actively monitor and assess the progress of the military departments, Defense Agencies, and prime contractors of the Department of Defense in attaining such goal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) in the case of the Coast Guard and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, actively monitor and assess the progress of the prime contractors of the agency in attaining such goal.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In making the assessment under clauses (iii) and (iv) of subparagraph (A), the head of the agency shall evaluate the extent to which use of the authority provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) and compliance with the requirement in paragraph (4) is effective for facilitating the attainment of the goal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To the extent practicable and when necessary to facilitate achievement of the 5 percent goal described in subsection (a), the head of an agency shall make advance payments under section 2307 of this title to contractors described in subsection (a). The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide guidance to contracting officers for making advance payments to entities described in subsection (a)(1) under such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To the extent practicable and when necessary to facilitate achievement of the 5 percent goal described in subsection (a), the head of an agency may enter into contracts using less than full and open competitive procedures (including awards under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act) and partial set asides for entities described in subsection (a)(1), but shall pay a price not exceeding fair market cost by more than 10 percent in payment per contract to contractors or subcontractors described in subsection (a). The head of an agency shall adjust the percentage specified in the preceding sentence for any industry category if available information clearly indicates that nondisadvantaged small business concerns in <!-- PDFPage:775 -->such industry category are generally being denied a reasonable opportunity to compete for contracts because of the use of that percentage in the application of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To the extent practicable, the head of an agency shall maximize the number of minority small business concerns, historically Black colleges and universities, and minority institutions participating in the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Each head of an agency shall prescribe regulations which provide for the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Procedures or guidance for contracting officers to provide incentives for prime contractors referred to in subsection (a)(3) to increase subcontractor awards to entities described in subsection (a)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A requirement that contracting officers emphasize the award of contracts to entities described in subsection (a)(1) in all industry categories, including those categories in which such entities have not traditionally dominated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Guidance to agency personnel on the relationship among the following programs:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The program implementing this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) The program established under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) The small business set-aside program established under section 15(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(a)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) With respect to an agency procurement which is reasonably likely to be set aside for entities described in subsection (a)(1), a requirement that (to the maximum extent practicable) the procurement be designated as such a set-aside before the solicitation for the procurement is issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Policies and procedures which, to the maximum extent practicable, will ensure that current levels in the number or dollar value of contracts awarded under the program established under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)) and under the small business set-aside program established under section 15(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(a)) are maintained and that every effort is made to provide new opportunities for contract awards to eligible entities, in order to meet the goal of subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Implementation of this section in a manner which will not alter the procurement process under the program established under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) A requirement that one factor used in evaluating the performance of a contracting officer be the ability of the officer to increase contract awards to entities described in subsection (a)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) Increased technical assistance to entities described in subsection (a)(1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Penalties and Regulations Relating to Status</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Whoever for the purpose of securing a contract or subcontract under subsection (a) misrepresents the status of any concern or person as a small business concern owned and controlled by a minority (as described in subsection (a)), shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than one year, or a fine under title 18, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall prohibit awarding a contract under this section to an entity described in subsection (a)(1) unless the entity agrees to comply with the requirements of section 15(<em>o</em>)(1) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(<em>o</em>)(1)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Industry Categories</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the head of the agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ensure that no particular industry category bears a disproportionate share of the contracts awarded to attain the goal established by subsection (a); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) ensure that contracts awarded to attain the goal established by subsection (a) are made across the broadest possible range of industry categories.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under procedures prescribed by the head of the agency, a person may request the Secretary to determine whether the use of small disadvantaged business set asides by a contracting activity of the agency has caused a particular industry category to bear a disproportionate share of the contracts awarded to attain the goal established for that contracting activity for the purposes of this section. Upon making a determination that a particular industry category is bearing a disproportionate share, the head of the agency shall take appropriate actions to limit the contracting activity's use of set asides in awarding contracts in that particular industry category.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Compliance With Subcontracting Plan Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall contain regulations to ensure that potential contractors submitting sealed bids or competitive proposals to the agency for procurement contracts to be awarded under the program provided for by this section are complying with applicable subcontracting plan requirements of section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The regulations required by paragraph (1) shall ensure that, with respect to a sealed bid or competitive proposal for which the bidder or offeror is required to negotiate or submit a subcontracting plan under section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)), the subcontracting plan shall be a factor in evaluating the bid or proposal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Annual Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than December 15 of each year, the head of the agency shall submit to Congress a report on the progress of the agency toward attaining the goal of subsection (a) during the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The report required under paragraph (1) shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A full explanation of any progress toward attaining the goal of subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A plan to achieve the goal, if necessary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The report required under paragraph (1) shall also include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The aggregate differential between the fair market price of all contracts awarded pursuant to subsection (e)(3) and the estimated fair market price of all such contracts had such contracts been entered into using full and open competitive procedures.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:776 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) An analysis of the impact that subsection (a) shall have on the ability of small business concerns not owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to compete for contracts with the agency.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (e)(1)(L) is based on section 2399 of this title as enacted by Pub. L. 97&ndash;295, &sect;1(29)(A), Oct. 12, 1982, 96 Stat. 1293.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 1(f)(2) of the bill would transfer the provisions of existing 10 U.S.C. 2399 to a new subparagraph (L) of 10 U.S.C. 2324(e)(1). The existing section 2399 prohibits the use of appropriated funds to reimburse a defense contractor for insurance against the contractor's costs of correcting defects in the contractor's materials or workmanship. The transfer would add the provision to the list of contractor costs which are not allowable as expenses which may be paid by the Department of Defense under a contract. This allowable cost limitation applies only to contracts for more than $100,000 other than fixed price contracts without cost incentives (see 10 US.C. 2324(k)). The committee determined that it is appropriate to treat the subject matter of section 2399 in the same manner as other provisions relating to allowable costs of defense contractors and notes that section 2324, providing a more comprehensive treatment of allowable costs, was enacted after section 2399. The committee recognizes that contracts for amounts less than $100,000 and fixed price contracts <!-- PDFPage:782 -->without cost incentives are covered by the existing section 2399 and would not be covered by the provision as transferred. The committee determined that in practice the existing section 2399 would not have significant applicability to such contracts and that the transfer is appropriate as part of this bill.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (j) is based on Pub. L. 99&ndash;145, title IX, &sect;933, Nov. 8, 1985, 99 Stat. 700.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) ensure appropriate emphasis on technical and quality factors in the source selection process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) require identification of any hours in excess of 40-hour weeks included in a proposal;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) provide guidance to contracting officers to ensure that any use of uncompensated overtime will not degrade the level of technical expertise required to perform the contract.</p>
