<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Except as provided in subsections (b), (c), and (g) and except in the case of procurement procedures otherwise expressly authorized by statute, the head of an agency in conducting a procurement for property or services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive procedures that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the competitive procedure appropriate under the circumstances, the head of an agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall solicit sealed bids if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) time permits the solicitation, submission, and evaluation of sealed bids;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the award will be made on the basis of price and other price-related factors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) it is not necessary to conduct discussions with the responding sources about their bids; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) there is a reasonable expectation of receiving more than one sealed bid; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall request competitive proposals if sealed bids are not appropriate under clause (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The head of an agency may provide for the procurement of property or services covered by this chapter using competitive procedures but excluding a particular source in order to establish or maintain an alternative source or sources of supply for that property or service if the head of the agency determines that to do so&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) would increase or maintain competition and would likely result in reduced overall costs for such procurement, or for any anticipated procurement, of property or services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) would be in the interest of national defense in having a facility (or a producer, manufacturer, or other supplier) available for furnishing the property or service in case of a national emergency or industrial mobilization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) would be in the interest of national defense in establishing or maintaining an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) would ensure the continuous availability of a reliable source of supply of such property or service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) would satisfy projected needs for such property or service determined on the basis of a history of high demand for the property or service; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) in the case of medical supplies, safety supplies, or emergency supplies, would satisfy a critical need for such supplies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an agency may provide for the procurement of property or services covered by this section using competitive procedures, but excluding concerns other than small business concerns in furtherance of sections 9 and 15 of <!-- PDFPage:1097 -->the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638, 644) and concerns other than small business concerns, historically Black colleges and universities, and minority institutions in furtherance of section 2323 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A contract awarded pursuant to the competitive procedures referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not be subject to the justification and approval required by subsection (f)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A determination under paragraph (1) may not be made for a class of purchases or contracts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The head of an agency may use procedures other than competitive procedures only when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the agency's need for the property or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the United States would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order (A) to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing property or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization, (B) to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center, or (C) to procure the services of an expert for use, in any litigation or dispute (including any reasonably foreseeable litigation or dispute) involving the Federal Government, in any trial, hearing, or proceeding before any court, administrative tribunal, or agency, or to procure the services of an expert or neutral for use in any part of an alternative dispute resolution or negotiated rulemaking process, whether or not the expert is expected to testify;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the terms of an international agreement or a treaty between the United States and a foreign government or international organization, or the written directions of a foreign government reimbursing the agency for the cost of the procurement of the property or services for such government, have the effect of requiring the use of procedures other than competitive procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) subject to subsection (k), a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the procurement be made through another agency or from a specified source, or the agency's need is for a brand-name commercial item for authorized resale;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the disclosure of the agency's needs would compromise the national security unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the head of the agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) determines that it is necessary in the public interest to use procedures other than competitive procedures in the particular procurement concerned, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) notifies the Congress in writing of such determination not less than 30 days before the award of the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) For the purposes of applying subsection (c)(1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a contract for property or services to be awarded on the basis of acceptance of an unsolicited research proposal, the property or services shall be considered to be available from only one source if the source has submitted an unsolicited research proposal that demonstrates a concept&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) that is unique and innovative or, in the case of a service, for which the source demonstrates a unique capability of the source to provide the service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the substance of which is not otherwise available to the United States, and does not resemble the substance of a pending competitive procurement; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, or the continued provision of highly specialized services, such property or services may be deemed to be available only from the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) substantial duplication of cost to the United States which is not expected to be recovered through competition; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's needs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The authority of the head of an agency under subsection (c)(7) may not be delegated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The contract period of a contract described in subparagraph (B) that is entered into by an agency pursuant to the authority provided under subsection (c)(2)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) may not exceed the time necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) to meet the unusual and compelling requirements of the work to be performed under the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) for the agency to enter into another contract for the required goods or services through the use of competitive procedures; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) may not exceed one year unless the head of the agency entering into such contract determines that exceptional circumstances apply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) This paragraph applies to any contract in an amount greater than the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The head of an agency using procedures other than competitive procedures to procure property or services by reason of the application of subsection (c)(2) or (c)(6) shall request offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the head of an agency may not award a contract using procedures other than competitive procedures unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the contracting officer for the contract justifies the use of such procedures in writing and certifies the accuracy and completeness of the justification;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1098 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the justification is approved&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in the case of a contract for an amount exceeding $500,000 (but equal to or less than $10,000,000), by the competition advocate for the procuring activity (without further delegation) or by an official referred to in clause (ii) or (iii);</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) in the case of a contract for an amount exceeding $75,000,000, by the senior procurement executive of the agency designated pursuant to section 16(c) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 414(c)) (without further delegation) or in the case of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, acting in his capacity as the senior procurement executive for the Department of Defense, the Under Secretary's delegate designated pursuant to paragraph (6)(B); and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) when a statute expressly requires that the procurement be made from a specified source;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The justification required by paragraph (1)(A) shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a description of the agency's needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an identification of the statutory exception from the requirement to use competitive procedures and a demonstration, based on the proposed contractor's qualifications or the nature of the procurement, of the reasons for using that exception;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) In no case may the head of an agency&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) special simplified procedures for purchases of property and services for amounts greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but not greater than $5,000,000 with respect to which the contracting officer reasonably expects, based on the nature of the property or services sought and on market research, that offers will include only commercial items.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1099 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) A proposed purchase or contract for an amount above the simplified acquisition threshold may not be divided into several purchases or contracts for lesser amounts in order to use the simplified procedures required by paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) It is the policy of Congress that an agency named in section 2303(a) of this title should not be required by legislation to award a new contract to a specific non-Federal Government entity.

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1)(A) In preparing for the procurement of property or services, the head of an agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) specify the agency's needs and solicit bids or proposals in a manner designed to achieve full and open competition for the procurement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) use advance procurement planning and market research; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) develop specifications in such manner as is necessary to obtain full and open competition with due regard to the nature of the property or services to be acquired.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Each solicitation under this chapter shall include specifications which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) consistent with the provisions of this chapter, permit full and open competition; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the extent necessary to satisfy the needs of the agency or as authorized by law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For the purposes of subparagraphs (A) and (B), the type of specification included in a solicitation shall depend on the nature of the needs of the agency and the market available to satisfy such needs. Subject to such needs, specifications may be stated in terms of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) function, so that a variety of products or services may qualify;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) performance, including specifications of the range of acceptable characteristics or of the minimum acceptable standards; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) design requirements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to the specifications described in paragraph (1), a solicitation for sealed bids or competitive proposals (other than for a procurement for commercial items using special simplified procedures or a purchase for an amount not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold) shall at a minimum include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a statement of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) all significant factors and significant subfactors which the head of the agency reasonably expects to consider in evaluating sealed bids (including price) or competitive proposals (including cost or price, cost-related or price-related factors and subfactors, and noncost-related or nonprice-related factors and subfactors); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the relative importance assigned to each of those factors and subfactors; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) in the case of sealed bids&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) a statement that sealed bids will be evaluated without discussions with the bidders; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the time and place for the opening of the sealed bids; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of competitive proposals&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) either a statement that the proposals are intended to be evaluated with, and award made after, discussions with the offerors, or a statement that the proposals are intended to be evaluated, and award made, without discussions with the offerors (other than discussions conducted for the purpose of minor clarification) unless discussions are determined to be necessary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the time and place for submission of proposals.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In prescribing the evaluation factors to be included in each solicitation for competitive proposals, the head of an agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall clearly establish the relative importance assigned to the evaluation factors and subfactors, including the quality of the product or services to be provided (including technical capability, management capability, prior experience, and past performance of the offeror);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) shall include cost or price to the Federal Government as an evaluation factor that must be considered in the evaluation of proposals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) shall disclose to offerors whether all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) significantly more important than cost or price;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) approximately equal in importance to cost or price; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) significantly less important than cost or price.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The regulations implementing clause (iii) of subparagraph (A) may not define the terms &ldquo;significantly more important&rdquo; and &ldquo;significantly less important&rdquo; as specific numeric weights that would be applied uniformly to all solicitations or a class of solicitations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subsection prohibits an agency from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) providing additional information in a solicitation, including numeric weights for all evaluation factors and subfactors on a case-by-case basis; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) stating in a solicitation that award will be made to the offeror that meets the solicita<!-- PDFPage:1119 -->tion's mandatory requirements at the lowest cost or price.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The head of an agency, in issuing a solicitation for a contract to be awarded using sealed bid procedures, may not include in such solicitation a clause providing for the evaluation of prices for options to purchase additional property or services under the contract unless the head of the agency has determined that there is a reasonable likelihood that the options will be exercised.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The head of an agency shall evaluate sealed bids and competitive proposals and make an award based solely on the factors specified in the solicitation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) All sealed bids or competitive proposals received in response to a solicitation may be rejected if the head of the agency determines that such action is in the public interest.</p>

The award of a contract shall be made by transmitting, in writing or by electronic means, notice of the award to the successful bidder. Within three days after the date of contract award, the head of the agency shall notify, in writing or by electronic means, each bidder not awarded the contract that the contract has been awarded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The head of an agency shall evaluate competitive proposals in accordance with paragraph (1) and may award a contract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) after discussions with the offerors, provided that written or oral discussions have been conducted with all responsible offerors who submit proposals within the competitive range; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) based on the proposals received, without discussions with the offerors (other than discussions conducted for the purpose of minor clarification) provided that the solicitation included a statement that proposals are intended to be evaluated, and award made, without discussions, unless discussions are determined to be necessary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the contracting officer determines that the number of offerors that would otherwise be included in the competitive range under subparagraph (A)(i) exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range, in accordance with the criteria specified in the solicitation, to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the offerors rated most highly in accordance with such criteria.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the head of the agency shall award a contract with reasonable promptness to the responsible source whose proposal is most advantageous to the United States, considering only cost or price and the other factors included in the solicitation. The head of the agency shall award the contract by transmitting, in writing or by electronic means, notice of the award to such source and, within three days after the date of contract award, shall notify, in writing or by electronic means, all other offerors of the rejection of their proposals. This subparagraph does not apply with respect to the award of a contract for the acquisition of perishable subsistence items.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) When a contract is awarded by the head of an agency on the basis of competitive proposals, an unsuccessful offeror, upon written request received by the agency within 3 days after the date on which the unsuccessful offeror receives the notification of the contract award, shall be debriefed and furnished the basis for the selection decision and contract award. The head of the agency shall debrief the offeror within, to the maximum extent practicable, five days after receipt of the request by the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The debriefing shall include, at a minimum&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the offeror's offer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the overall evaluated cost and technical rating of the offer of the contractor awarded the contract and the overall evaluated cost and technical rating of the offer of the debriefed offeror;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the overall ranking of all offers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) a summary of the rationale for the award;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) in the case of a proposal that includes a commercial item that is an end item under the contract, the make and model of the item being provided in accordance with the offer of the contractor awarded the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The debriefing may not include point-by-point comparisons of the debriefed offeror's offer with other offers and may not disclose any information that is exempt from disclosure under section 552(b) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Each solicitation for competitive proposals shall include a statement that information described in subparagraph (B) may be disclosed in post-award debriefings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) If, within one year after the date of the contract award and as a result of a successful procurement protest, the agency seeks to fulfill the requirement under the protested contract either on the basis of a new solicitation of offers or on the basis of new best and final offers requested for that contract, the agency shall make available to all offerors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the information provided in debriefings under this paragraph regarding the offer of the contractor awarded the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the same information that would have been provided to the original offerors.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) When the contracting officer excludes an offeror submitting a competitive proposal from the competitive range (or otherwise excludes such an offeror from further consideration prior to the final source selection deci<!-- PDFPage:1120 -->sion), the excluded offeror may request in writing, within three days after the date on which the excluded offeror receives notice of its exclusion, a debriefing prior to award. The contracting officer shall make every effort to debrief the unsuccessful offeror as soon as practicable but may refuse the request for a debriefing if it is not in the best interests of the Government to conduct a debriefing at that time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The contracting officer is required to debrief an excluded offeror in accordance with paragraph (5) only if that offeror requested and was refused a preaward debriefing under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The debriefing conducted under subparagraph (A) shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the executive agency's evaluation of the significant elements in the offeror's offer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a summary of the rationale for the offeror's exclusion; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the executive agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The debriefing conducted under subparagraph (A) may not disclose the number or identity of other offerors and shall not disclose information about the content, ranking, or evaluation of other offerors&rsquo; proposals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The contracting officer shall include a summary of any debriefing conducted under paragraph (5) or (6) in the contract file.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include a provision encouraging the use of alternative dispute resolution techniques to provide informal, expeditious, and inexpensive procedures for an offeror to consider using before filing a protest, prior to the award of a contract, of the exclusion of the offeror from the competitive range (or otherwise from further consideration) for that contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) If the head of an agency considers that a bid or proposal evidences a violation of the antitrust laws, he shall refer the bid or proposal to the Attorney General for appropriate action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that before a contract for the delivery of supplies to the Department of Defense is entered into&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) when the appropriate officials of the Department are making an assessment of the most advantageous source for acquisition of the supplies (considering quality, price, delivery, and other factors), there is a review of the availability and cost of each item of supply&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) through the supply system of the Department of Defense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) under standard Government supply contracts, if the item is in a category of supplies defined under regulations of the Secretary of Defense as being potentially available under a standard Government supply contract; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there is a review of both the procurement history of the item and a description of the item, including, when necessary for an adequate description of the item, a picture, drawing, diagram, or other graphic representation of the item.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1)(A) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that, in preparing a solicitation for the award of a development contract for a major system, the head of an agency consider requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer proposals described in subparagraph (B). In determining whether to require such proposals, the head of the agency shall give due consideration to the purposes for which the system is being procured and the technology necessary to meet the system's required capabilities. If such proposals are required, the head of the agency shall consider them in evaluating the offeror's price.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Proposals referred to in the first sentence of subparagraph (A) are the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Proposals to incorporate in the design of the major system items which are currently available within the supply system of the Federal agency responsible for the major system, available elsewhere in the national supply system, or commercially available from more than one source.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) With respect to items that are likely to be required in substantial quantities during the system's service life, proposals to incorporate in the design of the major system items which the United States will be able to acquire competitively in the future.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that, in preparing a solicitation for the award of a production contract for a major system, the head of an agency consider requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer proposals described in subparagraph (B). In determining whether to require such proposals, the head of the agency shall give due consideration to the purposes for which the system is being procured and the technology necessary to meet the system's required capabilities. If such proposals are required, the head of the agency shall consider them in evaluating the offeror's price.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Proposals referred to in the first sentence of subparagraph (A) are proposals identifying opportunities to ensure that the United States will be able to obtain on a competitive basis items procured in connection with the system that are likely to be reprocured in substantial quantities during the service life of the system. Proposals submitted in response to such requirement may include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Proposals to provide to the United States the right to use technical data to be provided under the contract for competitive reprocurement of the item, together with the cost to the United States, if any, of acquiring such technical data and the right to use such data.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Proposals for the qualification or development of multiple sources of supply for the item.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2305a. Design-build selection procedures</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Authorization</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Unless the traditional acquisition approach of design-bid-build established under chapter 11 of title 40 is used or another acquisition procedure authorized by law is used, the head of an agency shall use the two-phase selection procedures authorized in this section for entering into a contract for the design and construction of a public building, facility, or work when a determination is made under subsection (b) that the procedures are appropriate for use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Criteria for Use</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contracting officer shall make a determination whether two-phase selection procedures are appropriate for use for entering into a contract for the design and construction of a public building, facility, or work when the contracting officer anticipates that three or more offers will be received for such contract, design work must be performed before an offeror can develop a price or cost proposal for such contract, the offeror will incur a substantial amount of expense in preparing the offer, and the contracting officer has considered information such as the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The extent to which the project requirements have been adequately defined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The time constraints for delivery of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The capability and experience of potential contractors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The suitability of the project for use of the two-phase selection procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The capability of the agency to manage the two-phase selection process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Other criteria established by the agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Procedures Described</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Two-phase selection procedures consist of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The agency develops, either in-house or by contract, a scope of work statement for inclusion in the solicitation that defines the project and provides prospective offerors with sufficient information regarding the Government's requirements (which may include criteria and preliminary design, budget parameters, and schedule or delivery requirements) to enable the offerors to submit proposals which meet the Government's needs. If the agency contracts for development of the scope of work statement, the agency shall contract for architectural and engineering services as defined by and in accordance with chapter 11 of title 40.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The contracting officer solicits phase-one proposals that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) include information on the offeror's&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) technical approach; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) technical qualifications; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) do not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) detailed design information; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) cost or price information.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The evaluation factors to be used in evaluating phase-one proposals are stated in the solicitation and include specialized experience and technical competence, capability to perform, past performance of the offeror's team (including the architect-engineer and construction members of the team) and other appropriate factors, except that cost-related or price-related evaluation factors are not permitted. Each solicitation establishes the relative importance assigned to the evaluation factors and subfactors that must be considered in the evaluation of phase-one proposals. The agency evaluates phase-one proposals on the basis of the phase-one evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The contracting officer selects as the most highly qualified the number of offerors specified in the solicitation to provide the property or services under the contract and requests the selected offerors to submit phase-two competitive proposals that include technical proposals and cost or price information. Each solicitation establishes with respect to phase two&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the technical submission for the proposal, including design concepts or proposed solutions to requirements addressed within the scope of work (or both), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the evaluation factors and subfactors, including cost or price, that must be considered in the evaluations of proposals in accordance with paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of section 2305(a) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The contracting officer separately evaluates the submissions described in subparagraphs (A) and (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The agency awards the contract in accordance with section 2305(b)(4) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Solicitation to State Number of Offerors To Be Selected for Phase Two Requests for Competitive Proposals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A solicitation issued pursuant to the procedures described in subsection (c) shall state the maximum number of offerors that are to be selected to submit competitive proposals pursuant to subsection (c)(4). The maximum number specified in the solicitation shall not exceed 5 unless the agency determines with respect to an individual solicitation that a specified number greater than 5 is in the Government's interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of the two-phase selection process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Requirement for Guidance and Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include guidance&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) regarding the factors that may be considered in determining whether the two-phase contracting procedures authorized by subsection (a) are appropriate for use in individual contracting situations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) regarding the factors that may be used in selecting contractors; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) providing for a uniform approach to be used Government-wide.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1125 --><p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Special Authority for Military Construction Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of a military department may use funds available to the Secretary under section 2807(a) or 18233(e) of this title to accelerate the design effort in connection with a military construction project for which the two-phase selection procedures described in subsection (c) are used to select the contractor for both the design and construction portion of the project before the project is specifically authorized by law and before funds are appropriated for the construction portion of the project. Notwithstanding the limitations contained in such sections, use of such funds for the design portion of a military construction project may continue despite the subsequent authorization of the project. The advance notice requirement of section 2807(b) of this title shall continue to apply whenever the estimated cost of the design portion of the project exceeds the amount specified in such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any military construction contract that provides for an accelerated design effort, as authorized by paragraph (1), shall include as a condition of the contract that the liability of the United States in a termination for convenience before funds are first made available for construction may not exceed an amount attributable to the final design of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For each fiscal year during which the authority provided by this subsection is in effect, the Secretary of a military department may select not more than two military construction projects to include the accelerated design effort authorized by paragraph (1) for each armed force under the jurisdiction of the Secretary. To be eligible for selection under this subsection, a request for the authorization of the project, and for the authorization of appropriations for the project, must have been included in the annual budget of the President for a fiscal year submitted to Congress under section 1105(a) of title 31.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Not later than March 1, 2008, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report evaluating the usefulness of the authority provided by this subsection in expediting the design and construction of military construction projects. The authority provided by this subsection expires September 30, 2008, except that, if the report required by this paragraph is not submitted by March 1, 2008, the authority shall expire on that date.</p>

Subject to the limitation in the preceding sentence, the other provisions of this section, and other applicable provisions of law, the head of an agency, in awarding contracts under this chapter after using procedures other than sealed-bid procedures, may enter into any kind of contract that he considers will promote the best interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Each contract awarded under this chapter after using procedures other than sealed-bid procedures shall contain a warranty, determined to be suitable by the head of the agency, that the contractor has employed or retained no person or selling agency to solicit or obtain the contract under an understanding or agreement for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee, except a bona fide employee or established commercial or selling agency maintained by him to obtain business. If a contractor breaks such a warranty the United States may annul the contract without liability or may deduct the commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee from the contract price or consideration. This subsection does not apply to a contract that is for an amount not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold or to a contract for the acquisition of commercial items.</p>

The fee for performing a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract for architectural or engineering services for a public work or utility plus the cost of those services to the contractor may not be more than 6 percent of the estimated cost of that work or project, not including fees. The fee for performing any other cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract may not be more than 10 percent of the estimated cost of the contract, not <!-- PDFPage:1126 -->including the fee. Determinations under this subsection of the estimated costs of a contract or project shall be made by the head of the agency at the time the contract is made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the purposes of this section, defective cost or pricing data are cost or pricing data which, as of the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or another date agreed upon between the parties), were inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent. If for purposes of the preceding sentence the parties agree upon a date other than the date of agreement on the price of the contract, the date agreed upon by the parties shall be as close to the date of agreement on the price of the contract as is practicable.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the contracting officer should have known that the cost and pricing data in issue were defective even though the contractor or subcontractor took no affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention of the contracting officer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the contract was based on an agreement between the contractor and the United States about the total cost of the contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item procured under such contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the prime contractor or subcontractor did not submit a certification of cost and pricing data relating to the contract as required under subsection (a)(2).</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A contractor shall not be allowed to offset an amount otherwise authorized to be offset under subparagraph (A) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the certification under subsection (a)(2) with respect to the cost or pricing data involved was known to be false when signed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the United States proves that, had the cost or pricing data referred to in subpara<!-- PDFPage:1131 -->graph (A)(ii) been submitted to the United States before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification) or, if applicable consistent with paragraph (1)(B), another date agreed upon between the parties, the submission of such cost or pricing data would not have resulted in an increase in that price in the amount to be offset.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Interest and Penalties for Certain Overpayments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the United States makes an overpayment to a contractor under a contract subject to this section and the overpayment was due to the submission by the contractor of defective cost or pricing data, the contractor shall be liable to the United States&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for the period beginning on the date the overpayment was made to the contractor and ending on the date the contractor repays the amount of such overpayment to the United States; and</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2306c. Multiyear contracts: acquisition of services</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to subsections (d) and (e), the head of an agency may enter into con<!-- PDFPage:1140 -->tracts for periods of not more than five years for services described in subsection (b), and for items of supply related to such services, for which funds would otherwise be available for obligation only within the fiscal year for which appropriated whenever the head of the agency finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there will be a continuing requirement for the services consonant with current plans for the proposed contract period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the furnishing of such services will require a substantial initial investment in plant or equipment, or the incurrence of substantial contingent liabilities for the assembly, training, or transportation of a specialized work force; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the use of such a contract will promote the best interests of the United States by encouraging effective competition and promoting economies in operation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Covered Services</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority under subsection (a) applies to the following types of services:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Operation, maintenance, and support of facilities and installations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Maintenance or modification of aircraft, ships, vehicles, and other highly complex military equipment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Specialized training necessitating high quality instructor skills (for example, pilot and air crew members; foreign language training).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Base services (for example, ground maintenance; in-plane refueling; bus transportation; refuse collection and disposal).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Environmental remediation services for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an active military installation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a military installation being closed or realigned under a base closure law; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a site formerly used by the Department of Defense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Applicable Principles</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In entering into multiyear contracts for services under the authority of this section, the head of the agency shall be guided by the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The portion of the cost of any plant or equipment amortized as a cost of contract performance should not exceed the ratio between the period of contract performance and the anticipated useful commercial life of such plant or equipment. Useful commercial life, for this purpose, means the commercial utility of the facilities rather than the physical life thereof, with due consideration given to such factors as location of facilities, specialized nature thereof, and obsolescence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Consideration shall be given to the desirability of obtaining an option to renew the contract for a reasonable period not to exceed three years, at prices not to include charges for plant, equipment and other nonrecurring costs, already amortized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Consideration shall be given to the desirability of reserving in the agency the right, upon payment of the unamortized portion of the cost of the plant or equipment, to take title thereto under appropriate circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Restrictions Applicable Generally</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The head of an agency may not initiate under this section a contract for services that includes an unfunded contingent liability in excess of $20,000,000 unless the congressional defense committees are notified of the proposed contract at least 30 days in advance of the award of the proposed contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an agency may not initiate a multiyear contract for services under this section if the value of the multiyear contract would exceed $500,000,000 unless authority for the contract is specifically provided by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The head of an agency may not terminate a multiyear procurement contract for services until 10 days after the date on which notice of the proposed termination is provided to the congressional defense committees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Before any contract described in subsection (a) that contains a clause setting forth a cancellation ceiling in excess of $100,000,000 may be awarded, the head of the agency concerned shall give written notification of the proposed contract and of the proposed cancellation ceiling for that contract to the congressional defense committees, and such contract may not then be awarded until the end of a period of 30 days beginning on the date of such notification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the case of a contract described in subsection (a) with a cancellation ceiling described in paragraph (4), if the budget for the contract does not include proposed funding for the costs of contract cancellation up to the cancellation ceiling established in the contract, the head of the agency concerned shall give written notification to the congressional defense committees of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the cancellation ceiling amounts planned for each program year in the proposed multiyear procurement contract, together with the reasons for the amounts planned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the extent to which costs of contract cancellation are not included in the budget for the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a financial risk assessment of not including budgeting for costs of contract cancellation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Cancellation or Termination for Insufficient Funding After First Year</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the event that funds are not made available for the continuation of a multiyear contract for services into a subsequent fiscal year, the contract shall be canceled or terminated, and the costs of cancellation or termination may be paid from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) appropriations originally available for the performance of the contract concerned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) appropriations currently available for procurement of the type of services concerned, and not otherwise obligated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) funds appropriated for those payments.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Multiyear Contract Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For the purposes of this section, a multiyear contract is a contract for the purchase of services for more than one, but not more than five, program years. Such a contract may provide that performance under the contract during the second and subsequent years of the contract is contingent upon the appropriation of funds and (if it does so provide) may provide for a cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if such appropriations are not made.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:1141 --><p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Military Installation Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;military installation&rdquo; has the meaning given such term in section 2801(c)(2) of this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Payment Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The head of any agency may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) make advance, partial, progress, or other payments under contracts for property or services made by the agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) insert in solicitations for procurement of property or services a provision limiting to small business concerns advance or progress payments.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Performance-Based Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever practicable, payments under subsection (a) shall be made on any of the following bases:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Performance measured by objective, quantifiable methods such as delivery of acceptable items, work measurement, or statistical process controls.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Accomplishment of events defined in the program management plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Other quantifiable measures of results.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Payment Amount</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Payments made under subsection (a) may not exceed the unpaid contract price.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Security for Advance Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Advance payments made under subsection (a) may be made only if the contractor gives adequate security and after a determination by the head of the agency that to do so would be in the public interest. Such security may be in the form of a lien in favor of the United States on the property contracted for, on the balance in an account in which such payments are deposited, and on such of the property acquired for performance of the contract as the parties may agree. This lien is paramount to any other liens and is effective immediately upon the first advancement of funds without filing, notice, or any other action by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Conditions for Progress Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that any payment for work in progress (including materials, labor, and other items) under a defense contract that provides for such payments is commensurate with the work accomplished that meets standards established under the contract. The contractor shall provide such information and evidence as the Secretary of Defense determines necessary to permit the Secretary to carry out the preceding sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall ensure that progress payments referred to in paragraph (1) are not made for more than 80 percent of the work accomplished under a defense contract so long as the Secretary has not made the contractual terms, specifications, and price definite.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection applies to any contract in an amount greater than $25,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Conditions for Payments for Commercial Items</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Payments under subsection (a) for commercial items may be made under such terms and conditions as the head of the agency determines are appropriate or customary in the commercial marketplace and are in the best interests of the United States. The head of the agency shall obtain adequate security for such payments. If the security is in the form of a lien in favor of the United States, such lien is paramount to all other liens and is effective immediately upon the first payment, without filing, notice, or other action by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Advance payments made under subsection (a) for commercial items may include payments, in a total amount of not more than 15 percent of the contract price, in advance of any performance of work under the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The conditions of subsections (d) and (e) need not be applied if they would be inconsistent, as determined by the head of the agency, <!-- PDFPage:1142 -->with commercial terms and conditions pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Certain Navy Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of the Navy shall provide that the rate for progress payments on any contract awarded by the Secretary for repair, maintenance, or overhaul of a naval vessel shall be not less than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 95 percent, in the case of a firm considered to be a small business; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 90 percent, in the case of any other firm.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of the Navy may advance to private salvage companies such funds as the Secretary considers necessary to provide for the immediate financing of salvage operations. Advances under this paragraph shall be made on terms that the Secretary considers adequate for the protection of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of the Navy shall provide, in each contract for construction or conversion of a naval vessel, that, when partial, progress, or other payments are made under such contract, the United States is secured by a lien upon work in progress and on property acquired for performance of the contract on account of all payments so made.

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Waiver by Other Law</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A provision of law may not be construed as prohibiting the acquisition of a higher quantity of an end item under this section unless that provision of law&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2319. Encouragement of new competitors</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section, the term &ldquo;qualification requirement&rdquo; means a requirement for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be completed by an offeror before award of a contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Except as provided in subsection (c), the head of the agency shall, before establishing a qualification requirement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prepare a written justification stating the necessity for establishing the qualification requirement and specify why the qualification requirement must be demonstrated before contract award;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) specify in writing and make available to a potential offeror upon request all requirements which a prospective offeror, or its product, must satisfy in order to become qualified, such requirements to be limited to those least restrictive to meet the purposes necessitating the establishment of the qualification requirement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) specify an estimate of the costs of testing and evaluation likely to be incurred by a potential offeror in order to become qualified;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) ensure that a potential offeror is provided, upon request and on a reimbursable basis, a prompt opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification using qualified personnel and facilities of the agency concerned or of another agency obtained through interagency agreement, or under contract, or other methods approved by the agency (including use of approved testing and evaluation services not provided under contract to the agency);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) if testing and evaluation services are provided under contract to the agency for the purposes of clause (4), provide to the extent possible that such services be provided by a contractor who is not expected to benefit from an absence of additional qualified sources and who shall be required in such contract to adhere to any restriction on technical data asserted by the potential offeror seeking qualification; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) ensure that a potential offeror seeking qualification is promptly informed as to whether qualification is attained and, in the event qualification is not attained, is promptly furnished specific information why qualification was not attained.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply with respect to a qualification requirement established by statute or administrative action before October 19, 1984, unless such requirement is a qualified products list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), if it is unreasonable to specify the standards for qualification which a prospective offeror or its product must satisfy, a determination to that effect shall be submitted to the advocate for competition of the procuring activity responsible for the purchase of the item subject to the qualification requirement. After considering any <!-- PDFPage:1151 -->comments of the advocate for competition reviewing such determination, the head of the purchasing office may waive the requirements of clauses (2) through (6) of subsection (b) for up to two years with respect to the item subject to the qualification requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The waiver authority provided in this paragraph does not apply with respect to a qualified products list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A potential offeror may not be denied the opportunity to submit and have considered an offer for a contract solely because the potential offeror (A) is not on a qualified bidders list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified products list, or (B) has not been identified as meeting a qualification requirement established after October 19, 1984, if the potential offeror can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the contracting officer (or, in the case of a contract for the procurement of an aviation critical safety item or ship critical safety item, the head of the design control activity for such item) that the potential offeror or its product meets the standards established for qualification or can meet such standards before the date specified for award of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing contained in this subsection requires the referral of an offer to the Small Business Administration pursuant to section 8(b)(7) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(b)(7)) if the basis for the referral is a challenge by the offeror to either the validity of the qualification requirement or the offeror's compliance with such requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The head of an agency need not delay a proposed procurement in order to comply with subsection (b) or in order to provide a potential offeror with an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The requirements of subsection (b) also apply before enforcement of any qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) If the number of qualified sources or qualified products available to compete actively for an anticipated future requirement is fewer than two actual manufacturers or the products of two actual manufacturers, respectively, the head of the agency concerned shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) periodically publish notice in the Commerce Business Daily soliciting additional sources or products to seek qualification, unless the contracting officer determines that such publication would compromise national security; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) bear the cost of conducting the specified testing and evaluation (excluding the costs associated with producing the item or establishing the production, quality control, or other system to be tested and evaluated) for a small business concern or a product manufactured by a small business concern which has met the standards specified for qualification and which could reasonably be expected to compete for a contract for that requirement, but such costs may be borne only if the head of the agency determines that such additional qualified sources or products are likely to result in cost savings from increased competition for future requirements sufficient to amortize the costs incurred by the agency within a reasonable period of time considering the duration and dollar value of anticipated future requirements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an agency shall require a prospective contractor requesting the United States to bear testing and evaluation costs under paragraph (1)(B) to certify as to its status as a small business concern under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Within seven years after the establishment of a qualification requirement under subsection (b) or within seven years following an agency's enforcement of a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list, any such qualification requirement shall be examined and revalidated in accordance with the requirements of subsection (b). The preceding sentence does not apply in the case of a qualification requirement for which a waiver is in effect under subsection (c)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Except in an emergency as determined by the head of the agency, whenever the head of the agency determines not to enforce a qualification requirement for a solicitation, the agency may not thereafter enforce that qualification requirement unless the agency complies with the requirements of subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;aviation critical safety item&rdquo; means a part, an assembly, installation equipment, launch equipment, recovery equipment, or support equipment for an aircraft or aviation weapon system if the part, assembly, or equipment contains a characteristic any failure, malfunction, or absence of which could cause a catastrophic or critical failure resulting in the loss of or serious damage to the aircraft or weapon system, an unacceptable risk of personal injury or loss of life, or an uncommanded engine shutdown that jeopardizes safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;ship critical safety item&rdquo; means any ship part, assembly, or support equipment containing a characteristic the failure, malfunction, or absence of which could cause a catastrophic or critical failure resulting in loss of or serious damage to the ship or unacceptable risk of personal injury or loss of life.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;design control activity&rdquo;, with respect to an aviation critical safety item or ship critical safety item, means the systems command of a military department that is specifically responsible for ensuring the airworthiness of an aviation system or equipment, or the seaworthiness of a ship or ship equipment, in which such item is to be used.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2320. Rights in technical data</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to define the legitimate interest of the United States and of a contractor or subcontractor in technical data pertaining to an item or process. Such regulations shall be included in regulations of the Department of Defense prescribed as part of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Such regulations may not impair any right of the United States or of any contractor or subcontractor with respect to patents or copyrights or any other right in technical data otherwise established by law. Such regulations also may not impair the right of a contractor or subcontractor to receive from a third party a fee or royalty for the use of technical data pertaining to an item or process developed exclusively at private expense by the contractor or subcontractor, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such regulations shall include the following provisions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the case of an item or process that is developed by a contractor or subcontractor exclusively with Federal funds (other than an item or process developed under a contract or subcontract to which regulations under section 9(j)(2) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638(j)(2)) apply), the United States shall have the unlimited right to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) use technical data pertaining to the item or process; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) release or disclose the technical data to persons outside the government or permit the use of the technical data by such persons.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Except as provided in subparagraphs (C) and (D), in the case of an item or process that is developed by a contractor or subcontractor exclusively at private expense, the contractor or subcontractor may restrict the right of the United States to release or disclose technical data pertaining to the item or process to persons outside the government or permit the use of the technical data by such persons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Subparagraph (B) does not apply to technical data that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) constitutes a correction or change to data furnished by the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) relates to form, fit, or function;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) is necessary for operation, maintenance, installation, or training (other than detailed manufacturing or process data); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) is otherwise publicly available or has been released or disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor without restriction on further release or disclosure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Notwithstanding subparagraph (B), the United States may release or disclose technical data to persons outside the Government, or permit the use of technical data by such persons, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such release, disclosure, or use&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) is necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) is a release or disclosure of technical data (other than detailed manufacturing or process data) to, or use of such data by, a foreign government that is in the interest of the United States and is required for evaluational or informational purposes;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such release, disclosure, or use is made subject to a prohibition that the person to whom the data is released or disclosed may not further release, disclose, or use such data; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is notified of such release, disclosure, or use.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) In the case of an item or process that is developed in part with Federal funds and in part at private expense, the respective rights of the United States and of the contractor or subcontractor in technical data pertaining to such item or process shall be established as early in the acquisition process as practicable (preferably during contract negotiations) and shall be based upon negotiations between the United States and the contractor, except in any case in which the Secretary of Defense determines, on the basis of criteria established in the regulations, that negotiations would not be practicable. The establishment of such rights shall be based upon consideration of all of the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The statement of congressional policy and objectives in section 200 of title 35, the statement of purposes in section 2(b) of the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 (15 U.S.C. 638 note), and the declaration of policy in section 2 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The interest of the United States in increasing competition and lowering costs by developing and locating alternative sources of supply and manufacture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The interest of the United States in encouraging contractors to develop at private expense items for use by the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) Such other factors as the Secretary of Defense may prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) A contractor or subcontractor (or a prospective contractor or subcontractor) may not <!-- PDFPage:1153 -->be required, as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for the award of a contract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to sell or otherwise relinquish to the United States any rights in technical data except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) rights in technical data described in subparagraph (C); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) under the conditions described in subparagraph (D); or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to refrain from offering to use, or from using, an item or process to which the contractor is entitled to restrict rights in data under subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) The Secretary of Defense may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) negotiate and enter into a contract with a contractor or subcontractor for the acquisition of rights in technical data not otherwise provided under subparagraph (C) or (D), if necessary to develop alternative sources of supply and manufacture;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) agree to restrict rights in technical data otherwise accorded to the United States under this section if the United States receives a royalty-free license to use, release, or disclose the data for purposes of the United States (including purposes of competitive procurement); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) permit a contractor or subcontractor to license directly to a third party the use of technical data which the contractor is otherwise allowed to restrict, if necessary to develop alternative sources of supply and manufacture.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Defense shall define the terms &ldquo;developed&rdquo;, &ldquo;exclusively with Federal funds&rdquo;, and &ldquo;exclusively at private expense&rdquo; in regulations prescribed under paragraph (1). In defining such terms, the Secretary shall specify the manner in which indirect costs shall be treated and shall specify that amounts spent for independent research and development and bid and proposal costs shall not be considered to be Federal funds for the purposes of definitions under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Regulations prescribed under subsection (a) shall require that, whenever practicable, a contract for supplies or services entered into by an agency named in section 2303 of this title contain appropriate provisions relating to technical data, including provisions&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) defining the respective rights of the United States and the contractor or subcontractor (at any tier) regarding any technical data to be delivered under the contract and providing that, in the case of a contract for a commercial item, the item shall be presumed to be developed at private expense unless shown otherwise in accordance with section 2321(f);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) specifying the technical data, if any, to be delivered under the contract and delivery schedules for such delivery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) establishing or referencing procedures for determining the acceptability of technical data to be delivered under the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) establishing separate contract line items for the technical data, if any, to be delivered under the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to the maximum practicable extent, identifying, in advance of delivery, technical data which is to be delivered with restrictions on the right of the United States to use such data;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) requiring the contractor to revise any technical data delivered under the contract to reflect engineering design changes made during the performance of the contract and affecting the form, fit, and function of the items specified in the contract and to deliver such revised technical data to an agency within a time specified in the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) establishing remedies to be available to the United States when technical data required to be delivered or made available under the contract is found to be incomplete or inadequate or to not satisfy the requirements of the contract concerning technical data; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) authorizing the head of the agency to withhold payments under the contract (or exercise such other remedies as the head of the agency considers appropriate) during any period if the contractor does not meet the requirements of the contract pertaining to the delivery of technical data.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Review of Restrictions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that there is a thorough review of the appropriateness of any use or release restriction asserted with respect to technical data by a contractor or subcontractor at any tier under a contract subject to this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The review of an asserted use or release restriction under paragraph (1) shall be conducted before the end of the three-year period beginning on the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date on which final payment is made on the contract under which the technical data is required to be delivered; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Challenges to Restrictions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense may challenge a use or release restriction asserted with respect to technical data by a contractor or subcontractor at any tier under a contract subject to this section if the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reasonable grounds exist to question the current validity of the asserted restriction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the continued adherence by the United States to the asserted restriction would make it impracticable to procure the item to which the technical data pertain competitively at a later time.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A challenge to an asserted use or release restriction may not be made under paragraph (1) after the end of the three-year period described in subparagraph (B) unless the technical data involved&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) are publicly available;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) have been furnished to the United States without restriction; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) have been otherwise made available without restriction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The three-year period referred to in subparagraph (A) is the three-year period beginning on the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the date on which final payment is made on the contract under which the technical data are required to be delivered; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) state the specific grounds for challenging the asserted restriction;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) state that evidence of a justification described in paragraph (4) may be submitted.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) It is a justification of an asserted use or release restriction challenged under paragraph (1) that, within the three-year period preceding the challenge to the restriction, the Department of Defense validated a restriction identical to the asserted restriction if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such validation occurred after a challenge to the validated restriction under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the validated restriction was asserted by the same contractor or subcontractor (or a licensee of such contractor or subcontractor).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Time for Contractors to Submit Justifications</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a contractor or subcontractor asserting a use or release restriction submits to the contracting officer a written request, showing the need for additional time to comply with the requirement to justify the current validity of the asserted restriction, additional time to adequately permit the submission of such justification shall be provided by the contracting officer as appropriate. If a party asserting a restriction receives notices of challenges to restrictions on technical data from more than one contracting officer, and notifies each contracting officer of the existence of more than one challenge, the contracting officer initiating the first in time challenge, after consultation with the party asserting the restriction and the other contracting officers, shall formulate a schedule of responses to each of the challenges that will afford the party asserting the restriction with an equitable opportunity to respond to each such challenge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Presumption of Development Exclusively at Private Expense</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), in the case of a challenge to a use or release restriction that is asserted with respect to technical data of a contractor or subcontractor under a contract for commercial items, the contracting officer shall presume that the contractor or subcontractor has justified the restriction on the basis that the item was developed exclusively at private expense, whether or not the contractor or subcontractor submits a justification in response to the notice provided pursuant to subsection (d)(3). In such a case, the challenge to the use or release restriction may be sustained only if information provided by the Department of Defense demonstrates that the item was not developed exclusively at private expense.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under procedures prescribed by the head of the agency, a person may request the Secretary to determine whether the use of small disadvantaged business set asides by a contracting activity of the agency has caused a particular industry category to bear a disproportionate share of the contracts awarded to attain the goal established for that contracting activity for the purposes of this section.

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Penalty for Violation of Cost Principle</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the head of the agency determines that a cost submitted by a contractor in its proposal for settlement is expressly unallowable under a cost principle referred to in subsection (a) that defines the allowability of specific selected costs, the head of the agency shall assess a penalty against the contractor in an amount equal to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Waiver of Penalty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide for a penalty under subsection (b) to be waived in the case of a contractor's proposal for settlement of indirect costs when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the contractor withdraws the proposal before the formal initiation of an audit of the proposal by the Federal Government and resubmits a revised proposal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of unallowable costs subject to the penalty is insignificant; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the contractor demonstrates, to the contracting officer's satisfaction, that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(N) Costs of severance pay paid by the contractor to a foreign national employed by the contractor under a service contract performed in a foreign country if the termination of the employment of the foreign national is the result of the closing of, or the curtailment of activities at, a United States military facility in that country at the request of the government of that country.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The head of an agency shall make the final determination regarding whether to grant a waiver under subparagraph (A) with respect to a covered contract before award of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation implementing this section may establish appropriate definitions, exclusions, limitations, and qualifications.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Required Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall contain provisions on the allowability of contractor costs.

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (e)(1)(L) is based on section 2399 of this title as enacted by Pub. L. 97&ndash;295, &sect;1(29)(A), Oct. 12, 1982, 96 Stat. 1293.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 1(f)(2) of the bill would transfer the provisions of existing 10 U.S.C. 2399 to a new subparagraph (L) of 10 U.S.C. 2324(e)(1). The existing section 2399 prohibits the use of appropriated funds to reimburse a defense contractor for insurance against the contractor's costs of correcting defects in the contractor's materials or workmanship. The transfer would add the provision to the list of contractor costs which are not allowable as expenses which may be paid by the Department of Defense under a contract. This allowable cost limitation applies only to contracts for more than $100,000 other than fixed price contracts without cost incentives (see 10 U.S.C. 2324(k)). The committee determined that it is appropriate to treat the subject matter of section 2399 in the same manner as other provisions relating to allowable costs of defense contractors and notes that section 2324, providing a more comprehensive treatment of allowable costs, was enacted after section 2399. The committee recognizes that contracts for amounts less than $100,000 and fixed price contracts without cost incentives are covered by the existing section 2399 and would not be covered by the provision as transferred. The committee determined that in practice the existing section 2399 would not have significant applicability to such contracts and that the transfer is appropriate as part of this bill.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (j) is based on Pub. L. 99&ndash;145, title IX, &sect;933, Nov. 8, 1985, 99 Stat. 700.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the head of an agency may enter into share-in-savings contracts under this section in any given fiscal year even if funds are not made specifically available for the full costs of cancellation or termination of the contract if funds are available and sufficient to make payments with respect to the first fiscal year of the contract and the following conditions are met regarding the funding of cancellation and termination liability:</p>
