<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The timeliness of consideration of the contract by Congress is such that such a waiver is in the interest of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall submit a notice of any waiver under paragraph (1) to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;364, div. A, title I, &sect;128, Oct. 17, 2006, 120 Stat. 2109, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Securing and maintaining access to affordable and plentiful sources of energy is a vital national security interest for the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Nation's dependence upon foreign oil is a threat to national security due to the inherently volatile nature of the global oil market and the political instability of some of the world's largest oil producing states.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Given the recent increase in the cost of crude oil, which cannot realistically be expected to improve over the long term, other energy sources must be seriously considered.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Alternate propulsion sources such as nuclear power offer many advantages over conventional power for major surface combatant ships of the Navy, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) virtually unlimited high-speed endurance;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) elimination of vulnerable refueling; and</p>

<p class="note-body">In two instances, the source law to be codified by the bill includes provisions that on their face require that the Department of Defense notify Congress of certain actions. These notification requirements were terminated by section 602 of the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 (Public Law 99&ndash;433), which terminated all recurring reporting requirements applicable to the Department of Defense except for those requirements that were specifically exempted in that section. The source law sections are sections 8009(c) and 8005(j) (proviso) of the FY86 defense appropriations Act (Public Law 99&ndash;190), enacted December 19, 1985, which would be codified as section 2201 of title 10 (by section 1(d) of the bill) and section 7313(a) of title 10 (by section 1(n) of the bill). In codifying the authorities provided the Department of Defense by these two provisions of law, the committee believes that it is appropriate to reinstate the congressional notification requirements that go with those authorities. These sections were recurring annual appropriation provisions for many years and were made permanent only months before the enactment of the 1986 Reorganization Act. It is the committee's belief that the failure to exempt these provisions from the general reports termination provision was inadvertent and notes that the notification provisions had in fact previously applied to the Department of Defense for many years. The action of the committee restores the status quo as it existed before the Reorganization Act.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the allocable indirect private sector costs of a shipbuilder are those costs of the shipbuilder that are equal to the sum of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The incremental indirect costs attributable to such work.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The amount by which the revenue attributable to such private sector work exceeds the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the direct costs attributable to such private sector work; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the incremental indirect costs attributable to such private sector work.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The total amount of allocable indirect private sector costs for a contract covered by the agreement may not exceed the amount of indirect costs that a shipbuilder would have allocated to its private sector work during the period covered by the agreement in accordance with the shipbuilder's established accounting practices.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Modify Cost Reimbursement Rules</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The cost reimbursement rules set forth in subsection (b) may be modified by the Secretary of the Navy for a particular agreement if the Secretary determines that modifications are appropriate to the particular situation to facilitate achievement of the policy set forth in section 2501(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Applicability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An agreement entered into with a shipbuilder under subsection (a) shall apply to each of the following Navy contracts with the shipbuilder:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A contract that is in effect on the date on which the agreement is entered into.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A contract that is awarded during the term of the agreement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In a shipbuilding capability preservation agreement applicable to a shipbuilder, the Secretary may agree to apply the cost reimbursement rules set forth in subsection (b) to allocations of indirect costs to private sector work performed by the shipbuilder only with respect to costs that the shipbuilder incurred on or after November 18, 1997, under a contract between the shipbuilder and a private sector customer of the shipbuilder that became effective on or after January 26, 1996.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary, directly or by contract, lease, or otherwise, shall explore, prospect, conserve, develop, use, and operate the naval petroleum reserves in his discretion, subject to the provisions of subsection (c) and the other provisions of this chapter; except that no petroleum leases shall be granted at Naval Petroleum Reserves Numbered 1 and 3.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, particularly subsection (c), the naval petroleum reserves shall be used and operated for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the protection, conservation, maintenance, and testing of those reserves; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the production of petroleum whenever and to the extent that the Secretary, with the approval of the President, finds that such production is needed for national defense purposes and the production is authorized by a joint resolution of Congress.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) In administering Naval Petroleum Reserves Numbered 1, 2, and 3, the Secretary is authorized and directed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to further explore, develop, and operate such reserves;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to produce, during any extension of a period under paragraph (2), such reserves&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) at the maximum efficient rate consistent with sound engineering practices; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) at a lesser rate consistent with sound engineering practices and the protection, conservation, maintenance, and testing of such reserves if the Secretary determines that the minimum price described in section 7430(b)(2) of this title cannot be attained for the United States share of petroleum (other than natural gas liquids) produced from such Reserves;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) during such production period or any extension thereof to sell or otherwise dispose of the United States share of such petroleum produced from such reserves as provided in section 7430 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) to construct, acquire, or contract for the use of storage and shipping facilities on and off the reserves and pipelines and associated facilities on and off the reserves for transporting petroleum from such reserves to the points where the production from such reserves will be refined or shipped.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any pipeline in the vicinity of a naval petroleum reserve not otherwise operated as a common carrier may be acquired by the Secretary by condemnation, if necessary, if the owner thereof refuses to accept, convey, and transport without discrimination and at reasonable rates any petroleum produced at such reserve. With the approval of the Secretary, rights-of-way for new pipelines and associated facilities may be acquired by the exercise of the right of eminent domain in the appropriate United States district court. Such rights-of-way may be acquired in the manner set forth in sections 3114&ndash;3116 and 3118 of title 40, and the prospective holder of the right-of-way is &ldquo;the authority empowered by law to acquire the land&rdquo; within the meaning of those sections. Such new pipelines shall accept, convey, and transport without discrimination and at reasonable rates any petroleum produced at such reserves as a common carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After April 5, 1982, the President may extend the period of production in the case of any naval petroleum reserve for additional periods of not to exceed three years each&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) after the President requires an investigation to be made, in the case of each extension, to determine the necessity for continued production from such naval petroleum reserve;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) after the President submits to the Congress, at least 180 days before the expiration of the current production period prescribed by this section, or any extension thereof, a copy of the report made to him on such investigation together with a certification by him that continued production from such naval petroleum reserve is in the national interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) if neither House of Congress within ninety days after receipt of such report and certification adopts a resolution disapproving further production from such naval petroleum reserve.</p>

<p class="note-body">The source law provided that leases of lands of the United States within the naval petroleum reserves in existence before July 1, 1936, except leases that had become part of an approved unit or cooperative plan and agreement, should terminate at the end of their initial 20-year period, and that the lands covered by these leases could then be re-leased by the Secretary of the Navy. All of the leases covered by this provision have terminated as provided therein. Thus the provision for the termination of the leases is executed and the only remaining effect of the source is to authorize the re-lease of the lands formerly covered by the terminated leases. This section is worded accordingly. Reference to the classes of leases that were excepted from the termination is omitted as unnecessary because these leases were, of course, not terminated. They are not affected, since this section refers only to leases that were &ldquo;terminated by law&rdquo;.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In administering the naval petroleum reserves under this chapter, the Secretary shall use, store, or sell the petroleum produced from the naval petroleum reserves and lands covered by joint, unit, or other cooperative plans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Subject to paragraph (2) and notwithstanding any other provision of law, each sale of the United States share of petroleum shall be made by the Secretary at public sale to the highest qualified bidder, at such time, in such amounts, and after such advertising as the Secretary considers proper and without regard to Federal, State, or local regulations controlling sales or allocation of petroleum products. Each sale of the United States share of petroleum shall be for periods of not more than one year, except that a sale of natural gas may be made for a period of more than one year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not sell any part of the United States share of petroleum produced from Naval Petroleum Reserves Numbered 2 and 3 at a price less than the current sales price, as estimated by the Secretary, of comparable petroleum in the same area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of paragraph (2), the term &ldquo;petroleum&rdquo; does not include natural gas liquids.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In no event shall the Secretary permit the award of any contract which would result in any person obtaining control, directly or indirectly, over more than 20 percent of the estimated annual United States share of petroleum produced from Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Each proposal for sale under this title shall provide that the terms of every sale of the United States share of petroleum from the naval petroleum reserves shall be so structured as to give full and equal opportunity for the acquisition of petroleum by all interested persons, including major and independent oil producers and refiners alike. When the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, determines that the public interests will be served by the sale of petroleum to small refiners not having their own adequate sources of supply of petroleum, the Secretary is authorized and directed to set aside a portion of the United States share of petroleum produced for sale to such refiners under the provisions of this section for processing or use in such refineries, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) none of the production sold to small refiners may be resold in kind;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) production must be sold at a cost of not less than the prevailing local market price of comparable petroleum;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the set-aside portion may not exceed 25 percent of the estimated annual United States share of the total production from all producing naval petroleum reserves; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b), the Secretary may, at his discretion if he deems it to be in the public interest, prorate such petroleum among such refiners for sale, without competition, at not less than the prevailing local market price of comparable petroleum.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Any petroleum produced from the naval petroleum reserves, except such petroleum which is either exchanged in similar quantities for convenience or increased efficiency or transportation with persons or the government of an adjacent foreign state, or which is temporarily exported for convenience or increased efficiency of transportation across parts of an adjacent foreign state and reenters the United States, shall be subject to all of the limitations and licensing requirements of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.) and, in addition, before any petroleum subject to this section may be exported under the limitations and licensing requirement and penalty and enforcement provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979, the President must make and publish an express finding that such exports will not diminish the total quality or quantity of petroleum available to the United States and that such exports are in the national interest and are in accord with the Export Administration Act of 1979.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) During the period of production or any extension thereof authorized by section 7422(c) of this title, the consultation and approval requirements of section 7431(a)(3) of this title are waived.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Prior to the promulgation of any rules and regulations, plans of development and amendments thereto, and in the entering and making of contracts and operating agreements relating to the development, production, or sale of petroleum in or from the reserves, the Secretary shall consult with and give due consideration to the views of the Attorney General of the United States with respect to matters which may affect competition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No contract or operating agreement may be made, issued, or executed under this chapter until at least 15 days after the Secretary notifies the Attorney General of the proposed con<!-- PDFPage:1853 -->tract or operating agreement. Such notification shall contain such information as the Attorney General may require in order to advise the Secretary as to whether such contract or operating agreement may create or maintain a situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws. If, within such 15-day period, the Attorney General advises the Secretary that a contract or operating agreement may create or maintain a situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws, then the Secretary may not make, issue, or execute that contract or operating agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to confer on any person immunity from civil or criminal liability, or to create defenses to actions, under the antitrust laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) In this section, the term &ldquo;antitrust laws&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) sections 73 and 74 of the Wilson Tariff Act (15 U.S.C. 8 and 9); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Act of June 19, 1936 (commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Robinson-Patman Act&rdquo;) (15 U.S.C. 13a, 13b, and 21a).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Any pipeline which accepts, conveys, or transports any petroleum produced from Naval Petroleum Reserves Numbered 1 or Numbered 3 shall accept, convey, and transport without discrimination and at reasonable rates any such petroleum as a common carrier insofar as petroleum from such reserves is concerned. Every contract entered into by the Secretary for the sale of any petroleum owned by the United States which is produced from such reserves shall contain provisions implementing the requirements of the preceding sentence if the contractor owns a controlling interest in any pipeline or any company operating any pipeline, or is the operator of any pipeline, which carries any petroleum produced from such naval petroleum reserves. The Secretary may promulgate rules and regulations for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section and he, or the Secretary of the Interior where the authority extends to him, may declare forfeit any contract, operating agreement, right-of-way, permit, or easement held by any person violating any such rule or regulation. This section shall not apply to any natural gas common carrier pipeline operated by any person subject to regulation under the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717 et seq.) or any public utility subject to regulation by a State or municipal regulatory agency having jurisdiction to regulate the rates and charges for the sale of natural gas to consumers within the State or municipality.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) With respect to all or any part of the United States share of petroleum produced from the naval petroleum reserves, the President may direct that the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) place that petroleum in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as authorized by sections 151 through 166 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6231&ndash;6246); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) exchange, directly or indirectly, that petroleum for other petroleum to be placed in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve under such terms and conditions and by such methods as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, without regard to otherwise applicable Federal procurement statutes and regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The requirements of section 159 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6239) do not apply to actions taken under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter (but subject to paragraph (2)), during any period in which the production of petroleum is authorized from Naval Petroleum Reserves Numbered 1, 2, or 3, the Secretary, at the request of the Secretary of Defense, may provide any portion of the United States share of petroleum so produced to the Department of Defense for its use, exchange, or sale in order to meet petroleum product requirements of the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Petroleum may be provided to the Department of Defense under paragraph (1) either directly or by such exchange as the Secretary deems appropriate. Appropriate reimbursement reasonably reflecting the fair market value shall be provided by the Secretary of Defense for petroleum provided under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any exchange made pursuant to this subsection may be made without regard to otherwise applicable Federal procurement statutes and regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Paragraph (1) does not apply to any petroleum set aside for small refiners under subsection (d) or placed in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve under subsection (k).</p>

It was designed to avoid reviving stale claims upon enactment of the source law on July 3, 1944. However, as a matter of practice, no claims are settled under this authority which are more than two years old, in line with the two-year statute of limitations contained in the Suits in Admiralty Act and the Public Vessels Act. This limitation has been officially publicized in the Federal Register for May 22, 1947, p. 3296, and in 32 C.F.R. 752.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;including aircraft&rdquo; are omitted as covered by subsection (b). The section is <!-- PDFPage:1877 -->written to make the words &ldquo;during war&rdquo; applicable to the entire chapter. These words appear in 34 U.S.C. 1159, but not in 34 U.S.C. 1131. Prize is historically and uniformly treated as a war-time matter, so no substantive change results from the extension. The words &ldquo;this chapter does not affect&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;nothing herein contained shall be construed as affecting, or in any way impairing&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;Air Force&rdquo; are added under authority of &sect;305(a) of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (5 U.S.C. 171<em>l</em>), to provide the same applicability as formerly provided by the word &ldquo;Army&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;legal&rdquo; is omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the definition of the term &ldquo;ship&rdquo; is omitted as covered by the term &ldquo;vessel&rdquo;. All of 34 U.S.C. 1132 except that part which includes &ldquo;aircraft&rdquo; within the term &ldquo;vessels&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary since the defined term &ldquo;vessels of the Navy&rdquo; does not appear in the provisions to which the definition is made applicable. The last sentence of 34 U.S.C. 1158 applies only to Title LIV (Prize) of the Revised Statutes. In subsection (d) it is broadened to cover the entire body of statutory prize law. Additions to the prize law made by the Act of August 18, 1942, ch. 553, 56 Stat. 746, as amended, operated only to extend the jurisdiction of courts of the United States to certain cases in which the prizes are not brought into the territorial waters of the United States. Relations of this country with other countries are not affected by the 1942 Act except when jurisdiction is exercised by American courts over prizes brought into cobelligerent ports. As that Act provides that the consent of the cobelligerent is necessary to the exercise of such jurisdiction, the rule against contravention of treaties is properly applied to it.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) reflects 28 U.S.C. 1333 by restating the basic prize jurisdiction of that section over prizes brought into the United States, and by providing that the extension of prize jurisdiction conferred by 34 U.S.C. 1159 on the United States district courts is exclusive of the courts of the States. 34 U.S.C. 1166 and the second sentence of 34 U.S.C. 1164 are executed in the single jurisdictional statement of this section and the consolidation of the Act of August 18, 1942, ch. 553, 56 Stat. 746 (34 U.S.C. 1159&ndash;1166) with the earlier prize provisions. The words &ldquo;during war&rdquo; in 34 U.S.C. 1159 are omitted as covered in &sect;7651 of this title. In clause (1) the words &ldquo;or the Territories, Commonwealths, or possessions&rdquo; are added, since &ldquo;United States&rdquo; in this title is geographically limited to the 48 States and the District of Columbia, whereas the term here is intended to include all places within the jurisdiction of the district courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (4) the words &ldquo;taken or&rdquo; preceding the words &ldquo;appropriated for the use of the United States&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage and in order to avoid confusion between the two meanings of the word &ldquo;taken&rdquo; in prize law. In both the Revised Statutes and the 1942 Act the phrase &ldquo;taken or appropriated&rdquo; means no more than &ldquo;appropriated&rdquo; alone, whereas &ldquo;taken&rdquo;, in the phrase &ldquo;taken as prize&rdquo; means &ldquo;captured&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is included to make the statement of jurisdiction complete. It is derived by implication from the first sentence of R.S. 4625 (34 U.S.C. 1141) which is the source of subsection (c) of &sect;7653 of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is inserted in order to present a complete statement of the subject matter of the section. Its substance is not specifically set out in the Revised Statutes but is strongly implied in 34 U.S.C. 1135 which requires the United States attorney for the district in which the port is located to file a libel.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the requisites for jurisdiction conferred under the 1942 Act are substituted for the words &ldquo;brought under the jurisdiction conferred by this Act&rdquo;. The substituted words are the same as those used in clauses (2), (3), and (4) of the preceding section except that the words &ldquo;before proceedings are started&rdquo; are added following the words &ldquo;appropriated for the use of the United States&rdquo; for clarity. An appropriation can take place before or after proceedings are commenced, but in the latter case there is no occasion for the Attorney General to determine venue.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c) the words &ldquo;or if because the whole has been appropriated to the use of the United States&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;or the value of anything taken or appropriated for the use of the United States&rdquo; are omitted. The provision in the 1942 Act which empowers the Attorney General to decide the venue of proceedings when the prize property has been appropriated is incompatible with the provision in R.S. 4625 which authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to select the judicial district in such cases. Hence the 1942 Act superseded R.S. 4625 with respect to cases of this type. Deposit of the value of prize property appropriated by the United States is adequately covered in &sect;7663 of this title and is not mentioned here. The second sentence of 34 U.S.C. 1141 (R.S. 4625), relating to proceedings by captors, is omitted because it was rendered inoperative by the Act of March 3, 1899, ch. 413, &sect;13, 30 Stat. 1007, which repealed all laws authorizing the distribution of prize money to captors.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In each judicial district there may be not more than three prize commissioners, one of whom is the naval prize commissioner. They shall be appointed by the district court for service in connection with any prize cause in which proceedings are brought under section 7653(a) or (c) of this title. The naval prize commissioner must be an officer of the Navy whose appointment is approved by the Secretary of the Navy. The naval prize commissioner shall protect the interests of the Department of the Navy in the prize property. At least one of the other commissioners must be a member of the bar of the court, of not less than three years&rsquo; standing, who is experienced in taking depositions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A district court may appoint special prize commissioners to perform abroad, in connection with any prize cause in which proceedings are brought under section 7653(b) of this title, the duties prescribed for prize commissioners, and, in connection with those causes, to exercise anywhere such additional powers and perform such additional duties as the court considers proper, including the duties prescribed by this chapter for United States marshals. The court may determine the number and qualifications of the special prize commissioners it appoints, except that for each cause there shall be at least one naval special prize commissioner. The naval special prize commissioner must be an officer of the Navy whose appointment is approved by the Secretary. The naval special prize commissioner shall protect the interests of the Department of the Navy in the prize property.</p>

<p class="note-body">The first sentence of subsection (a) is reworded to make it clear that the limitation as to number applies to the number of prize commissioners who may serve in each judicial district at any one time and that the court is not precluded from making additional appointments to fill vacancies. The words &ldquo;for service in connection with any prize cause in which proceedings are brought under section 7653(a) or (c) of this title&rdquo; are added to distinguish the prize commissioners from the special prize commissioners mentioned in subsection (b). The words &ldquo;officer of the Navy&rdquo; in subsections (a) and (b) are substituted for the words &ldquo;naval officer, active or retired&rdquo; because an officer of the Navy does not lose his status as such upon retirement, and to retain these words would open to question the many other <!-- PDFPage:1879 -->provisions in this subtitle treating retired officers as officers.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the words &ldquo;in connection with any prize cause in which proceedings are brought under section 7653(b) of this title&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;in cases arising under this Act&rdquo; for accuracy of reference. The words &ldquo;including the duties prescribed by this chapter for United States marshals&rdquo; are added for clarity. Section 7662 of this title prescribes the duties of marshals. Most of these duties could not be performed by the marshals if the prize was not brought into a United States port. In such cases occurring during World War II the courts, under the authority of the 1942 Act, required the special prize commissioners to perform the duties ordinarily performed by the marshals. The words &ldquo;without regard for the requirements of section 7367 of this title&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary, since that section is codified in subsection (a), and language distinguishing the prize commissioners from the special prize commissions is included in each subsection.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Any officer or agency designated by the President may appropriate for the use of the United States any captured vessel, arms, munitions, or other material taken as prize. The department or agency for whose use the prize property is appropriated shall deposit the value of the property with the Treasurer of the United States or with the public depositary nearest to the court in which the proceedings are to be had, subject to the orders of the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Whenever any captured vessel, arms, munitions, or other material taken as prize is appropriated for the use of the United States before that property comes into the custody of the prize court, it shall be surveyed, appraised, and inventoried by persons as competent and impartial as can be obtained, and the survey, appraisal, and inventory sent to the court in which the proceedings are to be had. If the property is appropriated after it comes into the custody of the court, sufficient notice shall be given to enable the court to have the property appraised for the protection of the rights of the claimants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), in any case where prize property is appropriated for the use of the United States, a prize court may adjudicate the cause on the basis of an inventory and survey and an appropriate undertaking by the United States to respond for the value of the property, without either an appraisal or a deposit of the value of the prize with the Treasurer of the United States or a public depositary.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;may appropriate&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;the power to take or appropriate * * * may be exercised&rdquo;, in 34 U.S.C. 1162, for clarity and uniformity of statement. Under the Revised Statutes it was implied and understood that the Navy could appropriate prizes on behalf of the United States for use by the Navy. Use by other government agencies was not contemplated. The 1942 Act enabled the Navy to turn prize vessels over to the War Shipping Administration without bringing them back to United States ports. Reference to that Administration in subsection (a) is omitted since the Administration has been abolished and these functions have not been specifically vested in its successors. It is surplusage as well, because the authority to appropriate is given to any officer or agency designated by the President.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proviso added to R.S. 4624 (34 U.S.C. 1140) by the 1945 amendment is identical with the proviso added to the 1942 Act (34 U.S.C. 1162) by the 1944 amendment. The 1945 Act completed the process of making the procedure under the Revised Statutes the same as that in effect for causes over which the courts were given jurisdiction by the World War II legislation, and its single statement in subsection (c) is therefore justified.</p>
<p class="note-body">34 U.S.C. 1140 and the revised section reflect the Act of March 3, 1899, ch. 413, &sect;13, 30 Stat. 1007, which repealed laws authorizing distribution of prize proceeds to captors, and the Act of May 29, 1920, ch. 214, 41 Stat. 654, which requires substitution of &ldquo;Treasurer of the United States or public depositary&rdquo; for &ldquo;assistant treasurer&rdquo;.</p>

Thus the only part of R.S. 4630 that remains in effect, as is indicated in 34 U.S.C. 1151, is that part which provides that proceeds shall be decreed to the United States. The section is so worded. R.S. 4641 stated how proceeds decreed to captors should be divided among them. These provisions were eliminated by the Act of March 3, 1899, supra.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (c) the words &ldquo;restore the property&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;adjudge to be restored.&rdquo; A similar substitution is made in subsection (d).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d) the words &ldquo;foreign government&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;foreign prince, government, or state&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (e) is derived from the next to the last sentence of R.S. 4652 which, when enacted, read:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The whole amount awarded as salvage shall be decreed to the captors and no part to the United States, and shall be distributed as in the case of proceeds of property condemned as prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Act of March 3, 1899, ch. 413, &sect;13, 30 Stat. 1007, repealed all laws authorizing the distribution of prize money to captors. Accordingly, 34 U.S.C. 1158 states:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The whole amount awarded as salvage shall be disposed of as in the case of proceeds of property condemned as prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">As shown in &sect;7668 of this title, the net proceeds of property condemned as prize must be decreed to the United States. Subsection (e) is phrased so as to state directly, instead of by reference, the fact that the amount awarded as salvage is paid to the government. While this is apparently inconsistent with R.S. 4652 as originally enacted, it is consistent with the intent expressed by Congress in the provision of the Act of March 3, 1899 (supra), which repealed provisions relating to the distribution of prize money and bounty to crews. This act, it is true, did not mention salvage; and salvage money is still occasionally awarded to crews of naval vessels. However, such occasions are rare, and it is the general policy of the Department of the Navy not to claim salvage on behalf of its personnel. No case appears in which salvage derived from prize has been claimed for such personnel. Prize salvage is more closely related to prize money than it is to other salvage. The determination by Congress that captors should not share in the proceeds of prizes is, therefore, as in 34 U.S.C. 1158, carried through the revised section to salvage derived from prize. The word &ldquo;amounts&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;the whole amount&rdquo;.</p>
