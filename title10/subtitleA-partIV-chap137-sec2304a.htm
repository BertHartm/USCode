<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Award</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to the requirements of this section, section 2304c of this title, and other applicable law, the head of an agency may enter into a task or delivery order contract (as defined in section 2304d of this title) for procurement of services or property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Solicitation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The solicitation for a task or delivery order contract shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The period of the contract, including the number of options to extend the contract and the period for which the contract may be extended under each option, if any.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The maximum quantity or dollar value of the services or property to be procured under the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A statement of work, specifications, or other description that reasonably describes the general scope, nature, complexity, and purposes of the services or property to be procured under the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Applicability of Restriction on Use of Noncompetitive Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The head of an agency may use procedures other than competitive procedures to enter into a task or delivery order contract under this section only if an exception in subsection (c) of section 2304 of this title applies to the contract and the use of such procedures is approved in accordance with subsection (f) of such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Single and Multiple Contract Awards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The head of an agency may exercise the authority provided in this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to award a single task or delivery order contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the solicitation states that the head of the agency has the option to do so, to award separate task or delivery order contracts for the same or similar services or property to two or more sources.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No determination under section 2304(b) of this title is required for award of multiple task or delivery order contracts under paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The regulations implementing this subsection shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) establish a preference for awarding, to the maximum extent practicable, multiple task or delivery order contracts for the same or similar services or property under the authority of paragraph (1)(B); and</p>
