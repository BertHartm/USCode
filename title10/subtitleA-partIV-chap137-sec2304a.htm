<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The maximum quantity or dollar value of the services or property to be procured under the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A statement of work, specifications, or other description that reasonably describes the general scope, nature, complexity, and purposes of the services or property to be procured under the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Applicability of Restriction on Use of Noncompetitive Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The head of an agency may use procedures other than competitive procedures to enter into a task or delivery order contract under this section only if an exception in subsection (c) of section 2304 of this title applies to the contract and the use of such procedures is approved in accordance with subsection (f) of such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Single and Multiple Contract Awards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The head of an agency may exercise the authority provided in this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to award a single task or delivery order contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the solicitation states that the head of the agency has the option to do so, to award separate task or delivery order contracts for the same or similar services or property to two or more sources.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1159 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) No determination under section 2304(b) of this title is required for award of multiple task or delivery order contracts under paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) No task or delivery order contract in an amount estimated to exceed $100,000,000 (including all options) may be awarded to a single source unless the head of the agency determines in writing that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the task or delivery orders expected under the contract are so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably perform the work;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the contract provides only for firm, fixed price task orders or delivery orders for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) products for which unit prices are established in the contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) services for which prices are established in the contract for the specific tasks to be performed;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) only one source is qualified and capable of performing the work at a reasonable price to the government; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) because of exceptional circumstances, it is necessary in the public interest to award the contract to a single source.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The head of the agency shall notify the congressional defense committees within 30 days after any determination under clause (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of subparagraph (A).</p>

The total contract period as extended may not exceed 10 years unless such head of an agency determines in writing that exceptional circumstances necessitate a longer contract period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Inapplicability to Contracts for Advisory and Assistance Services</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as otherwise specifically provided in section 2304b of this title, this section does not apply to a task or delivery order contract for the procurement of advisory and assistance services (as defined in section 1105(g) of title 31).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Relationship to Other Contracting Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section may be construed to limit or expand any authority of the head of an agency or the Administrator of General Services to enter into schedule, multiple award, or task or delivery order contracts under any other provision of law.</p>
