<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide assistance requested by State or local governmental authorities to perform disaster relief missions and activities, other emergency missions and activities, and nonemergency missions and activities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to fulfill its other purposes set forth in section 40302 of title 36.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Use Subject to Applicable Laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The use of equipment, supplies, or other resources under subsection (a) is subject to the laws and regulations that govern the use by nonprofit corporations of federally provided assets or of assets purchased with appropriated funds, as the case may be.</p>
