<p class="note-body">After the enactment of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, section 308 of the Army Organization Act of 1950 (10:61&ndash;1) provided for an Assistant Judge Advocate General and three brigadier generals in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the Army. The creation of these four general officer spaces served to increase the mentioned authorized strength figure from 357 to 361, and the figure 201 to 205. The opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1948/5806, 2 Sept. 1948) is in accord with that conclusion.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section reflects the authorized strength of the Regular Air Force in general officers on the active list resulting from the mentioned allocation to the Air Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">That allocation, and those mentioned in the explanation of subsection (c) below, have had the force of law since July 26, 1950, when the period for transfers, including the administrative authority to change these allocations, expired.</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;regular&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; throughout the revised subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), 10:506a(a) (1st proviso) is omitted, since there is no authority to appoint to a regular grade above major general. 10:506a(a) (last 65 words of 2d proviso) is omitted as executed by the declaration of a national emergency on December 16, 1950.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1), the figures &ldquo;4&rdquo; and &ldquo;2&rdquo; result from the allocation of the original figures &ldquo;16&rdquo; and &ldquo;8&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(2), the figure &ldquo;1&rdquo; results from the allocation of the original figures &ldquo;4&rdquo; and &ldquo;2&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(3), the figure &ldquo;1&rdquo; results from the allocation of the original figures &ldquo;2&rdquo; and &ldquo;1&rdquo;. (The major general was allocated to the Army, the brigadier general to the Air Force.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(4), the figures &ldquo;150&rdquo; and &ldquo;75&rdquo; result from the allocation of the original figures &ldquo;334&rdquo; and &ldquo;167&rdquo;. That allocation corresponds to the allotment made by the Secretary of War between the Air Corps and the Army exclusive of the Air Corps, the Medical Department, and the Chaplains, under 10: 506a(a) (3d proviso). That proviso is omitted as executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words &ldquo;by law to hold any civil office under the United States&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;by Acts of Congress to hold appointments in the Diplomatic or Consular Service of the Government or to hold any civil office under the Government&rdquo;.</p>
