<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) For the purpose of this chapter and chapter 363 of this title and under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, a person receiving an original appointment as a reserve commissioned officer in the Army or an assignment to an officer category in which advanced education or training or special experience is required or will be directly used shall be credited at the time of such appointment or assignment with any service as a commissioned officer, except service as a commissioned warrant officer, that he performed as a regular officer on active duty or as a reserve officer in an active status in any armed force, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or the Public Health Service before such appointment or assignment.  </p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to authorize the Secretary of the Army to limit the amount of prior commis<!-- PDFPage:1051 -->sioned service with which a person may be credited under paragraph (1), or to deny any such credit, in the case of a person who is credited with constructive service under subsection (b).  </p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army shall credit a person who is receiving an original appointment as a reserve commissioned officer in the Army or an assignment to an officer category in which advanced education or training or special experience is required or will be directly used and who has advanced education or training or special experience with constructive service for such education, training, or experience as follows:  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) One year for each year of advanced education beyond the baccalaureate degree level, for persons assigned to officer categories requiring such advanced education or an advanced degree as a prerequisite for such assignment. In determining the number of years of constructive service to be credited under this clause to officers in any professional field, the Secretary concerned shall credit an officer with, but with not more than, the number of years of advanced education required by a majority of institutions that award degrees in that professional field for completion of the advanced education or award of the advance degree.  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) Credit for any period of advanced education in a health profession (other than medicine and dentistry) beyond the baccalaureate degree level which exceeds the basic education criteria for assignment as an officer in such health profession, if such advanced education will be directly used by the Army.  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Credit for experience in a health profession (other than medicine or dentistry), if such experience will be directly used by the Army.  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Additional credit of (i) not more than one year for internship or equivalent graduate medical, dental, or other formal professional training required by the armed forces, and (ii) not more than one year for each additional year of such graduate-level training or experience creditable toward certification in a specialty required by the Army.  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Additional credit, in unusual cases, based on special experience in a particular field.  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Additional credit for experience as a physician or dentist, if assigned to the Medical or Dental Corps.  </p>
<br class="Q04" />
  <p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as authorized by the Secretary of the Army in individual cases and under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense in the case of a medical or dental officer, the amount of constructive service credited an officer under this subsection may not exceed the amount required in order for the officer to be eligible for an original appointment in the grade of major.  </p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Constructive service credited an officer under this subsection is in addition to any service credited that officer under subsection (a) and shall be credited at the time of the original appointment of the officer or his assignment to an officer category in which advanced education or training or special experience is required or will be directly used.  </p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Constructive service may not be credited under subsection (b) for education, training, or experience obtained while serving as a commissioned officer (other than a warrant officer) on active duty or in an active status. However, in the case of an officer who completes advanced education or receives an advanced degree while in an active status and in less than the number of years normally required to complete such advanced education or receive such advanced degree, constructive service may, subject to regulations prescribed under subsection (a)(2), be credited to the officer under subsection (b)(1)(A) to the extent that the number of years normally required to complete such advanced education or receive such advanced degree exceeds the actual number of years in which such advanced education or degree is obtained by the officer.  </p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If the Secretary of Defense determines that the number of qualified judge advocates serving on active duty in the Army in grades below major is critically below the number needed by the Army in such grades, he may authorize the Secretary of the Army to credit any person receiving an original appointment with a view to assignment in the Judge Advocate General's Corps with a period of constructive service in such an amount (in addition to any period of service credited such person under subsection (b)(1)) as will result in the grade of such person being that of captain and the date of rank of such person being junior to that of all other officers of the same grade serving on active duty.  </p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) An officer of the Army National Guard of the United States may decline a promotion under section 3366 or 3367 of this title if the governor or other appropriate authority of the State, Territory or Puerto Rico or the commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard, whichever is concerned, approves that action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) If an officer declines a promotion under subsection (f) or (g), his name shall be retained on the appropriate promotion list for a period of not more than three years from the date he was selected for promotion to the grade concerned unless&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Whenever the Secretary of the Army determines that, within the distribution of officers not assigned to units, there are existing or anticipated vacancies in the reserve grade of captain, major, or lieutenant colonel, he may convene a selection board to consider and recommend, for promotion to those grades, officers of the Army Reserve who are in an active status and who are not assigned to units organized to serve as units, reserve officers who are on active duty (other than for training), officers of any Army Reserve unit organized to serve as a unit, and officers of the Army National Guard of the United States. The Secretary shall prescribe for each zone of consideration list established under section 3364 of this title the minimum service, computed under section 3360(b) of this title, that an officer of the appropriate branch must have to be placed on that list. He shall require that each officer who has the prescribed service completed under that section, who is in an active status, and who is not assigned to a unit organized to serve as a unit, be placed on that list. Officers of any Army Reserve unit organized to serve as a unit, and officers of the Army National Guard of the United States, who have the prescribed service computed under that section, shall also be placed on that list. The Secretary shall prescribe the number to be recommended for promotion from each list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Subject to section 3380 of this title, an officer recommended for promotion under this section may be promoted whenever there is a vacancy, but it is not mandatory that the authorized number be maintained in any grade. Each officer of the Army National Guard of the United States who is recommended by a selection board for promotion under this section and who, before the date on which he would be promoted under this section, is appointed in the next higher grade to fill a vacancy in the Army National Guard and is federally recognized in that grade shall be promoted to that reserve grade effective as of the date on which he is so recognized. If he is not so appointed in the next higher grade in the Army National Guard and federally recognized in that grade, he shall, effective as of the date of the promotion under this section, have his Federal recognition terminated and be transferred to the Army Reserve. Each officer of an Army Reserve unit organized to serve as a unit who is promoted under this section shall, effective as of the date of that promotion, be transferred from his unit unless, upon his promotion, he fills a vacancy in that unit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A selection board considering officers under this section shall use one of the following methods, as directed by the Secretary of the Army:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) Consider the officers referred to it in the order of their service computed under section 3360(b) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) recommend those who are fully qualified for promotion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) pass over and report those not so qualified; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) continue this procedure until the number of officers specified by him is recommended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Recommend a number specified by him whom it considers to be the best qualified of those officers referred to it.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the method prescribed in clause (2) is used, the number recommended by the selection board must be at least 80 percent of the officers listed for consideration for the first time.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3370. Commissioned officers: promotion to grade of colonel to fill vacancies</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Whenever the Secretary of the Army determines that, within the distribution of officers not assigned to units, there are existing or anticipated vacancies in the reserve grade of colonel, he may convene a selection board to consider and recommend, to fill those vacancies, reserve officers who are in an active status and who are not assigned to units organized to serve as units, subject to section 3390 of this title, reserve officers who are on active duty (other than for training), officers of any unit of the Army Reserve organized to serve as a unit, and officers of the Army National Guard of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary shall prescribe for each zone of consideration list established under section 3364 of this title the amount of service computed under section 3360(b) of this title that an officer of the branch concerned must have to be placed on it for consideration under this section. So far as practicable, the amount of service prescribed shall correspond to that which an officer of the Regular Army in the same branch must have for consideration for promotion to the same grade. The Secretary shall require that each officer who is in an active status, who is not assigned to a unit organized to serve as a unit, and who has the prescribed service computed under that section, be placed on that list. Officers of any unit of the Army Reserve organized to serve as a unit, and any officer of the Army National Guard of the United States, who have the prescribed service computed under that section, shall also be placed on that list. He shall prescribe the number to be recommended for promotion from each list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A selection board considering officers under this section shall recommend the prescribed number of officers whom it considers to be the best qualified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Subject to section 3380 of this title, an officer recommended for promotion under this section may be promoted whenever there is a vacancy, but it is not mandatory that the authorized number be maintained in any grade. Each officer of the Army National Guard of the United States who is recommended for promotion under this section and who, before the date on which he would be promoted under this section, is appointed in the next higher grade to fill a vacancy in the Army National Guard and is federally recognized in that grade shall be promoted to that reserve grade effective as of the date on which he is so recognized. If he is not so appointed in the next higher grade in the Army National Guard and federally recognized in that grade, he shall, effective as of the date of the promotion under this section, have his Federal recognition terminated and be transferred to the Army Reserve. An officer of the Army National Guard of the United States may decline a promotion under this section if the governor or other appropriate authority of the State, Territory, or Puerto Rico, or the commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard, whichever is concerned, approves that action. If an officer of the Army National Guard of the United States so declines a promotion, his name shall be removed from the recommended list. Each officer of an Army Reserve unit organized to serve as a unit who is promoted under this section shall, effective as of the date of that promotion, be transferred from his unit unless upon his promotion he fills a vacancy in that unit. An officer of a unit of the Army Reserve organized to serve as a unit may decline a promotion under this section if the Secretary of the Army, or an officer designated by him, approves that action as being in the best interest of the Army. If an officer of a unit of the Army Reserve so declines a promotion, his name shall be removed from the recommended list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If an officer of the Army National Guard of the United States is found qualified for promotion under this section, section 3390 of this title applies in place of the examination for Federal recognition in the grade for which found qualified.</p>
