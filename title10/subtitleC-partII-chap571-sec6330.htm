<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;officers&rdquo; and &ldquo;assigned&rdquo; are omitted, since they are applicable only to the proviso in 34 U.S.C. 854, which is recommended for repeal as obsolete. (See Table 2A.) The words &ldquo;including (a) those former members of the Fleet Reserve who were transferred *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* but before the expiration of three months following discharge&rdquo;, appearing in &sect;803 of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 505 (34 U.S.C. 854 (note)) are omitted as surplusage. These words merely illustrate the class of persons transferred to the Fleet Reserve under the Naval Reserve Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1178, as referred to in the section from which these words were taken, and in no way limit that class or impose a citizenship requirement for membership in it. (See the opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, JAG:II:1:JFG:imz of February 17, 1953.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) reference to the date July 1, 1925, is omitted, since members who were in the naval service on or before that date may, if they are qualified and so elect, be transferred to the Fleet Reserve or to the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve under 34 U.S.C. 854c instead of under 34 U.S.C. 854b, as provided in the fifth proviso of 34 U.S.C. 854c. That proviso and the provisions of 34 U.S.C. 854b, which are applicable only to persons who were in the naval service in 1925, are not codified because they relate to a small closed class and are therefore of limited interest. They are not repealed, however. (See Table 2D.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (b) and (c) the term &ldquo;active service in the armed forces&rdquo; is substituted for the term &ldquo;active Federal service&rdquo; to execute the definition in the last sentence of 34 U.S.C. 854c.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c) the words &ldquo;is entitled, when not on active duty, to retainer pay at the rate of 21/2 percent <!-- PDFPage:2000 -->of the basic pay that he received at the time of transfer&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;except when on active duty, shall be paid at the annual rate of 21/2 per centum of the annual base and longevity pay they are receiving at the time of transfer&rdquo; to conform to the terminology of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (d) states the rule as to the method of counting minority and short-term enlistments, in connection with determining active service, in accordance with <em>White v. United States</em>, 97 F. Supp. 698.</p>
