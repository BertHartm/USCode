<p class="note-body">Senate and House of Representatives reports on the Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954 state, with reference to section 407 of the Act:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Promotions under this title would include Reserve officers not on active duty but in an active status in the Reserve and Reserve officers on continuous active duty under the Reserve program, but Reserve officers on active duty and on the lineal list would be promoted under other law, as they are at the present time. Officers of the Naval and Marine Corps Reserve selected for promotion under any provision of law would not be penalized by virtue of a change in status with respect to active duty prior to their promotion.&rdquo; (Senate Report No. 2010, July 29, 1954, 83d Congress, 2d Session; House Report No. 1026, July 29, 1953, 83d Congress, 1st Session; both to accompany H.R. 6573).</p>
<p class="note-body">For clarity, the general rule that this chapter does not cover the promotion of lineal list officers is set out in subsection (b), and the exceptions, to protect officers going on or coming off the lineal list shortly before they are due for consideration for promotion or for promotion, are covered in subsections (c), (d), and (e).</p>
<p class="note-body">It should be noted that women officers of the Naval and Marine Corps Reserve (other than women reserve officers in the Nurse Corps and women reserve officers appointed under section 5581 of this title) may not be placed on lineal lists, considered for promotion, or promoted under title III of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 because section 215 of the Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948 made title III of the Officer Personnel Act in applicable to them. These women officers, therefore, whether or not they are on active duty, are considered for promotion and promoted under the provisions of the Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954, codified in this chapter. Women officers in these categories may also be promoted (but only if they are on active duty) under the act of July 24, 1941, ch. 320 (55 Stat. 603, as amended; 34 U.S.C. 350&ndash;350k) (codified in section 5787 of this title). The latter act authorizes temporary promotions during war or emergency of regular and reserve officers on active duty.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 403 of the Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954 (50 U.S.C. 1303) provides that the laws relating to the selection for promotion of officers in the regular components apply to Reserves, except as otherwise provided. Laws governing the promotion of ensigns and second lieutenants and officers in the grade of rear admiral or major general in the regular components do not provide for consideration of these officers by selection boards. Officers in these grades in the reserve components are therefore excepted from the groups to be considered by boards convened under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;and other boards of officers appointed under this chapter&rdquo;, in 50:1193(a), are omitted as without application to the Navy or the Marine Corps. Boards to consider reserve officers for involuntary separation from an active status are the only other boards appointed under the Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954, and the convening of these boards is specifically provided for in section 411(f) of that act.

<p class="note-body">Section 406 of the Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954 (50 U.S.C. 1306) makes applicable to reserve officers on a promotion list the laws relating to promotion and eligibility for promotion of regular officers on a promotion list, except that non-lineal-list officers in the line of the Naval Reserve and non-lineal-list officers of the Marine Corps Reserve, instead of being promoted to fill vacancies in the higher grade, are promoted when their lineal-list contemporaries are promoted. Staff corps officers, both in the Regular Navy and in the Naval Reserve, are promoted with their running mates. Provisions relating to the eligibility for promotion of regular and lineal-list staff corps officers are codified in sections 5773 and 5774 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Officers of the Marine Corps Reserve not on a lineal list have regular officers as running mates. It is possible for a number of lineal-list reserve officers to rank below a non-lineal-list Reserve and above his running mate. In such a case, the non-lineal-list Reserve's eligibility for consideration for promotion and for promotion is made to depend not on his running mate, but on the lineal-list Reserve next junior to him (sections 405 and 406 of the Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954 (50 U.S.C. 1305, 1306)). The result is the same as that produced in the Navy by assigning lineal-list officers as running mates of non-lineal-list Reserves, but differences in phraseology are required to describe the process.</p>
<p class="note-body">Women officers of the Naval Reserve and the Marine Corps Reserve (except officers in the Nurse Corps and officers appointed under section 5581 of this title) have women regular officers as running mates. However, there are no women line officers of the Naval Reserve and no women officers of the Marine Corps Reserve on the lineal lists, since section 215 of the Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948 (34 U.S.C. 105j) made Title III of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 inapplicable to such women officers. The problem of tying a woman reserve officer's eligibility for promotion to someone other than her running mate does not, therefore, exist either in the Navy or in the Marine Corps.</p>

<p class="note-body">The House and Senate reports cited in the revision note on section 5891 of this title state that section 403 of the Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954 (50 U.S.C. 1303), &ldquo;by making applicable to Naval and Marine Corps Reserve officers those provisions of law *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* which relate to the selection for promotion of officers of the Regular components, would *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* provide a definition of failure of selection&rdquo;. The definition of &ldquo;failure of selection&rdquo; for regular officers and lineal-list Reserves is codified in section 5776 of this title. Differences between that section and this section are due to differences between the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 and the Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954. (1) Under the former Act, officers who are eligible for consideration for promotion include officers above the promotion zone, in the zone, and below the zone, whereas under the latter Act, the zone of eligibility and the promotion zone are identical, because no one is above the zone and no one below the zone is eligible for consideration. (2) There are no reserve officers who are restricted in the performance of duty. Therefore, this section has no counterpart for section 5776 (b). (3) In section 5776, subsection (a) covers male line officers, subsection (c) covers staff corps officers except certain officers in the Nurse Corps and women officers appointed under section 5590 of this title, and subsections (d) and (e) cover the officers excepted from subsection (c). This breakdown is not necessary in the present section. The Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954 provides for promotion zones for male line and staff corps officers of the Naval Reserve and male officers of the Marine Corps Reserve, but none for &ldquo;women officers&rdquo; or officers in the Nurse Corps Reserve. The latter two classes cannot be considered as having failed of selection, since promotion zones are essential to that concept. The others can, and the rule is the same as to all of them.</p>
<p class="note-body">The source for subsection (b) has no counterpart in the laws relating to regular and lineal-list reserve officers.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;a woman officer appointed under section 5581 of this title&rdquo; are inserted in this section as required by the act of June 24, 1952, ch. 457, 66 Stat. 155 (34 U.S.C. 21e). These officers are not &ldquo;women officers&rdquo; within the meaning of the Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954, but are required to be promoted and retired as if they were men.
