<p class="statutory-body">(3) Paragraph (1)(B) does not apply in any case of willful misconduct or gross negligence or in the case of a claim by a purchaser of articles or services under this section that damages or injury arose from the failure of the Government to comply with quality, schedule, or cost performance requirements in the contract to provide the articles or services.</p>
