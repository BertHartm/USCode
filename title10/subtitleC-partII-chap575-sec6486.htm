<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;or active duty for training&rdquo; are omitted as covered by the term &ldquo;active duty&rdquo; as used in this revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the words &ldquo;other than from active duty for training&rdquo; are inserted since the term &ldquo;active duty&rdquo; as used in 34 U.S.C. 854d (3d proviso) does not include active duty for training. Clause (3) is inserted, since other provisions of law are necessarily exceptions to the general rule here stated. The words &ldquo;or the Marine Corps&rdquo; are inserted in the last sentence of subsection (b) to reflect the applicability of the section to the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve.</p>
