<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;A Board of Visitors to the Naval Academy is constituted annually&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;There shall be appointed *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* every year a Board of Visitors&rdquo;, since appointments, in the strict sense, are not involved.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the language establishing staggered terms is eliminated as executed, and the existence of such terms is recognized by the use of the words &ldquo;two persons shall be designated by him each year to succeed the members whose terms expire that year&rdquo;. No effect is given to the language &ldquo;the nine Presidential appointees&rdquo;. The hearings indicate that one of the bills considered provided for nine such &ldquo;appointees&rdquo;, and it appears that the number nine was inadvertently retained. The provision specifically authorizes only six Presidential designees.</p>
