<p class="statutory-body">(b) The committee consists of officers in the grade of colonel or above, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) five members of the Regular Air Force on duty with the Air Staff;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The members of the Committee shall select the Chairman from among the members on the Committee not on active duty.</p>
