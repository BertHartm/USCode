<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) ensure that the difference in the cost of performing the function by a contractor compared to the cost of performing the function by Department of Defense civilian employees would be equal to or exceed the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) 10 percent of the personnel-related costs for performance of that function; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) $10,000,000.</p>
