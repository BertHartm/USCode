The word &ldquo;appoint&rdquo; has been used in various statutes when the intent of Congress was to provide authority in the persons named to &ldquo;choose,&rdquo; &ldquo;select,&rdquo; or &ldquo;nominate&rdquo; for the office of midshipman. These statutes have been collected and codified in &sect;6954 of this title, which reflects the various sources of nominees for &ldquo;appointment&rdquo; as midshipmen and the persons who may so &ldquo;nominate&rdquo; them. The actual appointing power resides in the President and this implied authority is herein expressed for clarity and for the purpose of uniformity of expression.</p>

<p class="note-body">All provisions of law authorizing appointments to the Naval Academy from various sources are collected in this section. The language is extensively changed to meet the needs of this organization of the source material. In those provisions that now authorize &ldquo;appointments&rdquo; by other than the President, the language is changed to indicate that the process is one of selection where the law requires selection by competitive examination, and to show that other candidates are nominated. The manner of appointing the selectees and nominees, in all cases, is covered in &sect;6953 of this title. In the case of nominees from States, the District of Columbia, Territories, and from Puerto Rico, the qualification that the nominees must be from the political subdivisions from which nominated is indicated. The requirement that the nominees be actual residents of the political subdivisions is contained in &sect;6958(b) of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1) the qualification that appointees must be from the sons of members of the various &ldquo;regular&rdquo; components of the armed forces is added, as &ldquo;Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard&rdquo; are so interpreted in this statute.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c) the proviso &ldquo;That all such appointees are otherwise qualified for admission&rdquo; is omitted as covered by &sect;6958 of this title setting forth qualifications of all candidates.</p>
<p class="note-body">The applicability to the United States Military Academy in the Act of June 8, 1926, ch. 492, as amended (34 U.S.C. 1036a; 10 U.S.C. 1091a), was repealed by section 6(c) of the Act of June 30, 1950, ch. 421, 64 Stat. 305.</p>

<p class="note-body">The section is worded to indicate that all appointments are made by the President, and that, before appointment, prospective midshipmen are &ldquo;nominees&rdquo; or &ldquo;candidates&rdquo;, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the provision authorizing the Secretary of the Navy to nominate candidates in the event nominations to fill vacancies under subsection (a) are not made by March fourth is omitted as covered by subsection (e), the purpose of which was to assure the entrance of a full class each year.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reference in subsection (e) to the strength of the &ldquo;brigade of midshipmen&rdquo; is dropped, since there is no statutory requirement that the midshipmen at the Academy be so organized, and the term is a recognition of current organization only. The language authorizing the Secretary, in his discretion, to nominate additional midshipmen to meet the needs of the armed services but not to exceed the authorized strength of the Academy is changed to authorize the Secretary to &ldquo;fill the vacancies by nominating additional midshipmen&rdquo;. In exercising his discretion under this subsection, these factors are necessarily considered by the Secretary, irrespective of a specific provision so instructing him.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f) the word &ldquo;admission&rdquo; is changed to the word &ldquo;appointment&rdquo;, since the admission of a person is a consequence of, and follows automatically from, his appointment.
