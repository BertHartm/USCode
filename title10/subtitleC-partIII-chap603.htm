<p class="note-body">This section is included in this chapter without specific reference to statutory source to resolve the ambiguities and conflicts existing in the statutes relating to the appointment of midshipmen at the Naval Academy. The word &ldquo;appoint&rdquo; has been used in various statutes when the intent of Congress was to provide authority in the persons named to &ldquo;choose,&rdquo; &ldquo;select,&rdquo; or &ldquo;nominate&rdquo; for the office of midshipman. These statutes have been collected and codified in &sect;6954 of this title, which reflects the various sources of nominees for &ldquo;appointment&rdquo; as midshipmen and the persons who may so &ldquo;nominate&rdquo; them. The actual appointing power resides in the President and this implied authority is herein expressed for clarity and for the purpose of uniformity of expression.</p>

<p class="note-body">All provisions of law authorizing appointments to the Naval Academy from various sources are collected in this section. The language is extensively changed to meet the needs of this organization of the source material. In those provisions that now authorize &ldquo;appointments&rdquo; by other than the President, the language is changed to indicate that the process is one of selection where the law requires selection by competitive examination, and to show that other candidates are nominated. The manner of appointing the selectees and nominees, in all cases, is covered in &sect;6953 of this title. In the case of nominees from States, the District of Columbia, Territories, and from Puerto Rico, the qualification that the nominees must be from the political subdivisions from which nominated is indicated. The requirement that the nominees be actual residents of the political subdivisions is contained in &sect;6958(b) of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1) the qualification that appointees must be from the sons of members of the various &ldquo;regular&rdquo; components of the armed forces is added, as &ldquo;Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard&rdquo; are so interpreted in this statute.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c) the proviso &ldquo;That all such appointees are otherwise qualified for admission&rdquo; is omitted as covered by &sect;6958 of this title setting forth qualifications of all candidates.</p>
