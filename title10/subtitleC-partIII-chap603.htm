<p class="note-body">This section is included in this chapter without specific reference to statutory source to resolve the ambiguities and conflicts existing in the statutes relating to the appointment of midshipmen at the Naval Academy. The word &ldquo;appoint&rdquo; has been used in various statutes when the intent of Congress was to provide authority in the persons named to &ldquo;choose,&rdquo; &ldquo;select,&rdquo; or &ldquo;nominate&rdquo; for the office of midshipman. These statutes have been collected and codified in &sect;6954 of this title, which reflects the various sources of nominees for &ldquo;appointment&rdquo; as midshipmen and the persons who may so &ldquo;nominate&rdquo; them. The actual appointing power resides in the President and this implied authority is herein expressed for clarity and for the purpose of uniformity of expression.</p>

In the case of nominees from States, the District of Columbia, Territories, and from Puerto Rico, the qualification that the nominees must be from the political subdivisions from which nominated is indicated. The requirement that the nominees be actual residents of the political subdivisions is contained in &sect;6958(b) of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">Reference in subsection (e) to the strength of the &ldquo;brigade of midshipmen&rdquo; is dropped, since there is no statutory requirement that the midshipmen at the Academy be so organized, and the term is a recognition of current organization only. The language authorizing the Secretary, in his discretion, to nominate additional midshipmen to meet the needs of the armed services but not to exceed the authorized strength of the Academy is changed to authorize the Secretary to &ldquo;fill the vacancies by nominating additional midshipmen&rdquo;. In exercising his discretion under this subsection, these factors are necessarily considered by the Secretary, irrespective of a specific provision so instructing him.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) That the midshipman will complete the course of instruction at the Naval Academy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) That upon graduation from the Naval Academy the midshipman&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) will serve on active duty for at least five years immediately after such appointment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) That if an appointment described in paragraph (2) is not tendered or if the midshipman is permitted to resign as a regular officer before completion of the commissioned service obligation of the midshipman, the midshipman&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purposes of paragraph (1), a midshipman shall be considered to have breached an agreement under subsection (a) if the midshipman is separated from the Naval Academy under circumstances which the Secretary determines constitute a breach by the midshipman of the midshipman's agreement to complete the course of instruction at the Naval Academy and accept an appointment as a commissioned officer upon graduation from the Naval Academy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary of the Navy shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section. Those regulations shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) standards for determining what constitutes, for the purpose of subsection (b), a breach of an agreement under subsection (a);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) procedures for determining whether such a breach has occurred; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) This section does not apply to a midshipman who is not a citizen or national of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this chapter, the term &ldquo;hazing&rdquo; means any unauthorized assumption of authority by a midshipman whereby another midshipman suffers or is exposed to any cruelty, indignity, humiliation, hardship, or oppression, or the deprivation or abridgement of any right.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Superintendent of the Naval Academy shall prescribe regulations, to be approved by the Secretary of the Navy, to prevent hazing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Hazing is an offense that may be dealt with as an offense against good order and discipline or as a violation of the regulations of the Naval Academy. However, no midshipman may be dismissed for a single act of hazing except by sentence of a court-martial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The finding and sentence of a court-martial of a midshipman for hazing shall be reviewed in the manner prescribed for general court-martial cases.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A midshipman who is sentenced to imprisonment for hazing may not be confined with persons who have been convicted of crimes or misdemeanors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) A midshipman who is dismissed from the Academy for hazing may not be reappointed as a midshipman or be appointed as a commissioned officer in the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps until two years after the graduation of the class of which he was a member.</p>

The enactment of the Uniform Code of Military Justice made midshipmen at the Naval Academy subject to the same military law which applies generally to the naval service, thereby superseding the special type of court-martial for midshipmen.
