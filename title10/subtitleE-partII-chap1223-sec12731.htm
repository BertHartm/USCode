<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;is entitled&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;shall *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* be granted&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;in the status of a commissioned officer, warrant officer, flight officer, or enlisted person&rdquo; and the references to reserve components are omitted as surplusage. Reference to the Army and the Air Force without component is inserted, since the words &ldquo;reserve component&rdquo;, as used in 10:1036a(a), include all members of the Army and the Air Force except members of the regular components thereof. The words &ldquo;service, computed under section 1332 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;satisfactory Federal service&rdquo; to make it clear that some service that is not normally covered by the latter term may be counted in determining rights to retired pay under this chapter. Section 311 of the source statute, which made title III of that act applicable to the Coast Guard, was expressly repealed by the Act of August 4, 1949, ch. 393, &sect;20, 63 Stat. 565, the act which codified Title 14 of the United States Code. 14 U.S.C. 755(e) provides for Coast Guard Reservists the same retirement benefits as those prescribed by law for the Naval Reserve, and, for this purpose, confers upon the Secretary of the Treasury the same authority as that conferred upon the Secretary of the Navy, when the Coast Guard is operating under the Treasury Department. Accordingly, the revised chapter is made expressly applicable to the Coast Guard.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;the Army without component or other category covered by section 1332(a)(1) of this title&rdquo; are inserted, since the words &ldquo;reserve component&rdquo;, as used in 10:1036a(a), also cover members without component and members of the other special categories listed. The words &ldquo;annual training duty, or attendance at a school designated as a service school by law or by the Secretary of the appropriate military department&rdquo; are inserted since the words &ldquo;active Federal service&rdquo;, as used in 10:1036a(a), also cover the additional service listed. The words &ldquo;active duty&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;active Federal service&rdquo; for uniformity.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1958 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">The change makes clear that in the determination of eligibility for retired pay for non&ndash;regular service, the service of a Regular serving in a temporary grade (that is, without component) may not be counted.
