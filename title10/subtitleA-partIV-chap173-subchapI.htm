<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Shared Energy Savings Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall develop a simplified method of contracting for shared energy savings contract services that will accelerate the use of these contracts with respect to military installations and will reduce the administrative effort and cost on the part of the Department of Defense as well as the private sector.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In carrying out paragraph (1), the Secretary of Defense may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) request statements of qualifications (as prescribed by the Secretary of Defense), including financial and performance information, from firms engaged in providing shared energy savings contracting;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) designate from the statements received, with an update at least annually, those firms that are presumptively qualified to provide shared energy savings services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) select at least three firms from the qualifying list to conduct discussions concerning a particular proposed project, including requesting a technical and price proposal from such selected firms for such project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) select from such firms the most qualified firm to provide shared energy savings services pursuant to a contractual arrangement that the Secretary determines is fair and reasonable, taking into account the estimated value of the services to be rendered and the scope and nature of the project.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In carrying out paragraph (1), the Secretary may also provide for the direct negotiation, by departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Department of Defense, of contracts with shared energy savings contractors that have been selected competitively and approved by any gas or electric utility serving the department, agency, or instrumentality concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Participation in Gas or Electric Utility Programs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall permit and encourage each military department, Defense Agency, and other instrumentality of the Department of Defense to participate in programs conducted by any gas or electric utility for the management of energy demand or for energy conservation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Acceptance of Financial Incentive, Goods, or Services</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense <!-- PDFPage:1646 -->may authorize any military installation to accept any financial incentive, goods, or services generally available from a gas or electric utility, to adopt technologies and practices that the Secretary determines are in the interests of the United States and consistent with the energy performance goals for the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Agreements With Gas or Electric Utilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense may authorize the Secretary of a military department having jurisdiction over a military installation to enter into agreements with gas or electric utilities to design and implement cost-effective demand and conservation incentive programs (including energy management services, facilities alterations, and the installation and maintenance of energy saving devices and technologies by the utilities) to address the requirements and circumstances of the installation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an agreement under this subsection provides for a utility to advance financing costs for the design or implementation of a program referred to in that paragraph to be repaid by the United States, the cost of such advance may be recovered by the utility under terms no less favorable than those applicable to its most favored customer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Subject to the availability of appropriations, repayment of costs advanced under paragraph (2) shall be made from funds available to a military department for the purchase of utility services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An agreement under this subsection shall provide that title to any energy-saving device or technology installed at a military installation pursuant to the agreement vest in the United States. Such title may vest at such time during the term of the agreement, or upon expiration of the agreement, as determined to be in the best interests of the United States.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Use of Renewable Forms of Energy Encouraged</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall encourage the use of energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy as a source of energy for military construction projects (including military family housing projects) where use of such form of energy is consistent with the energy performance goals and energy performance plan for the Department of Defense developed under section 2911 of this title and supported by the special considerations specified in subsection (c) of such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Consideration During Design Phase of Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary concerned shall require that the design of all new facilities (including family housing) shall include consideration of energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary concerned shall require that contracts for construction resulting from such design include a requirement that energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy be installed if such systems can be shown to be cost effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Determination of Cost Effectiveness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) For the purposes of this section, an energy system using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy for a facility shall be considered to be cost effective if the difference between (A) the original investment cost of the energy system for the facility with such a system, and (B) the original investment cost of the energy system for the facility without such a system can be recovered over the expected life of the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A determination under paragraph (1) concerning whether a cost-differential can be recovered over the expected life of a facility shall be made using the life-cycle cost methods and procedures established pursuant to section 544(a) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8254(a)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Exception to Square Feet and Cost Per Square Foot Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In order to equip a <!-- PDFPage:1647 -->military construction project (including a military family housing project) with heating equipment, cooling equipment, or both heating and cooling equipment using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy or with a passive energy system using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy, the Secretary concerned may authorize an increase in any otherwise applicable limitation with respect to the number of square feet or the cost per square foot of the project by such amount as may be necessary for such purpose. Any such increase under this subsection shall be in addition to any other administrative increase in cost per square foot or variation in floor area authorized by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Use of Energy Efficiency Products in New Construction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that energy efficient products meeting the requirements of the Department of Defense are used in new facility construction by or for the Department carried out under chapter 169 of this title if such products are readily available and their use is consistent with the energy performance goals and energy performance plan for the Department developed under section 2911 of this title and supported by the special considerations specified in subsection (c) of such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the energy efficiency of products, the Secretary shall consider products that&mdash;</p>
