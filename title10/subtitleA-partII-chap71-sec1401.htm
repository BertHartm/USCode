<p class="note-body">In the introductory paragraph, the applicability of the rule stated in the third sentence to situations not expressly covered by the laws named in the source statutes above is a practical construction that the rule must be reciprocally applied in all cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">In formula No. 1, the words &ldquo;whichever is earlier&rdquo;, in 37:272(d) (clause (2)), are omitted, since they are con<!-- PDFPage:523 -->trary to the rule stated in 37:272(e) (1st proviso of last sentence).</p>
<p class="note-body">In formula No. 3, the computation is based on monthly pay instead of annual pay to conform to the other formulas of the revised section. The words &ldquo;basic pay&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;base and longevity pay&rdquo; to conform to the terminology of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.). The words &ldquo;which he would receive if serving, at the time granted such pay, on active duty&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage and to conform to the other formulas of the revised section, since the effect of these words is covered by footnote 1. The words &ldquo;at any time&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;during his entire period of service&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Footnotes 1 and 2 reflect the long-standing construction of those provisions dealing with computation of retired pay which do not specifically provide that the member is entitled to compute his retired pay on the basis of the monthly basic pay to which he would be entitled if he were on active duty in his retired grade. The pertinent basic computation provisions for such retirement either provide for computation of retired pay on the same basis as the provisions dealing with higher retired grade, or the basic retirement provisions were enacted after the provisions authorizing higher retired grade. The words &ldquo;at rates applicable on date of retirement *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and adjust to reflect later changes in permanent rates&rdquo;, in footnote 1; and all of footnote 2; are based on the source statutes incorporated in the formulas to which footnotes 1 and 2 apply, as interpreted in an opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (1953/4120, 14 May 1953).</p>
<p class="note-body">In footnote 3, the words &ldquo;and disregard a part of a year that is less than six months&rdquo; are made applicable to formulas Nos. 1 and 2. The legislative history of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (Hearings before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on H.R. 5007, 81st Congress, First Session, page 313, July 6, 1949) indicates that the provisions, upon which formulas Nos. 1 and 2 are based, should be construed to require that a fraction of less than one-half of a year be disregarded. It also indicates that other retirement laws that are also silent on this point should be similarly construed.</p>
