<h4 class="note-head">1988 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (k) is based on Pub. L. 100&ndash;202, &sect;101(b) [title VIII, &sect;8042], 101 Stat. 1329&ndash;69.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 8042 of the FY88 Defense Appropriations Act (Public Law 100&ndash;202) established a requirement for the Secretary of Defense to submit an annual report on the cost of stationing United States forces overseas. Under that section, the annual report is to be sent to the Committees on Appropriations of the two Houses. In codifying that section as section 113(k) of title 10, the committee added the two Armed Services Committees as committees to be sent the annual report. This minor change from the source law does not change the nature of the report to be submitted.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:31 --><p class="note-body">The committee notes that the source section does not specify the period of time to be covered by the report. In the absence of statutory language specifying the period to be covered by the report, it would seem reasonable to conclude that the report should cover the previous fiscal year. The committee notes, however, that the report of the Senate Appropriations Committee on its FY88 defense appropriations bill (S. Rpt. 100&ndash;235) states that this new annual report &ldquo;should cover the budget years and the 2 previous fiscal years&rdquo; (page 54). The committee believes that such a requirement may be unnecessarily burdensome and in any case, if such a requirement is intended, should be stated in the statute. In the absence of clear intent, the provision is proposed to be codified without specifying the period of time to be covered by the annual report.</p>
<p class="note-body">In codifying this provision, the committee also changed the term &ldquo;United States troops&rdquo; in the source law to &ldquo;United States forces&rdquo; for consistency in usage in title 10 and as being preferable usage. No change in meaning is intended. The committee also changed &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; to &ldquo;outside the United States&rdquo; and defined &ldquo;United States&rdquo; for this purpose to include the territories and possessions of the United States. The committee was concerned that the term &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; read literally could include Hawaii or Guam, an interpretation clearly not intended in enacting section 8042. The committee notes that the Senate report referred to above states &ldquo;For the purposes of this report [meaning the new DOD annual report], U.S. forces stationed overseas are considered to be those outside of the United States and its territories.&rdquo;. The committee extrapolates from this statement that provisions in the report requirement relating to expenditures &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; and costs incurred &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; are also to be construed as relating to matters outside the United States and its territories and has prepared the codified provision accordingly.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Review the laws, regulations, policies, directives, and practices that govern personal relationships between men and women in the Armed Forces and personal relationships between members of the Armed Forces and non-military personnel of the opposite sex.</p>

The review shall include a review of the basic training policies and practices of each of those services with regard to gender-integrated and gender-segregated basic training and, for each of the services, the effectiveness of gender-integrated and gender-segregated basic training.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) As part of the review under paragraph (1), the commission shall (with respect to each of the services) take the following measures:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(A) Determine how each service defines gender-integration and gender-segregation in the context of basic training.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Determine the historical rationales for the establishment and disestablishment of gender-integrated or gender-segregated basic training.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) Examine, with respect to each service, the current rationale for the use of gender-integrated or gender-segregated basic training and the rationale that was current as of the time the service made a decision to integrate, or to segregate, basic training by gender (or as of the time of the most recent decision to continue to use a gender-integrated format or a gender-segregated format for basic training), and, as part of the examination, evaluate whether at the time of that decision, the Secretary of the military department with jurisdiction over that service had substantive reason to believe, or has since developed data to support, that gender-integrated basic training, or gender-segregated basic training, improves the readiness or performance of operational units.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(D) Assess whether the concept of &lsquo;training as you will fight&rsquo; is a valid rationale for gender-integrated basic training or whether the training requirements and objectives for basic training are sufficiently different from those of operational units so that such concept, when balanced against other factors relating to basic training, might not be a sufficient rationale for gender-integrated basic training.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(E) Identify the requirements unique to each service that could affect a decision by the Secretary concerned to adopt a gender-integrated or gender-segregated format for basic training and assess whether the format in use by each service has been successful in meeting those requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(F) Assess, with respect to each service, the degree to which different standards have been established, or if not established are in fact being implemented, for males and females in basic training for matters such as physical fitness, physical performance (such as confidence and obstacle courses), military skills (such as marksmanship and hand-grenade qualifications), and nonphysical tasks required of individuals and, to the degree that differing standards exist or are in fact being implemented, assess the effect of the use of those differing standards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(G) Identify the goals that each service has set forth in regard to readiness, in light of the gender-integrated or gender-segregated format that such service has adopted for basic training, and whether that format contributes to the readiness of operational units.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(H) Assess the degree to which performance standards in basic training are based on military readiness.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(I) Evaluate the policies of each of the services regarding the assignment of adequate numbers of female drill instructors in gender-integrated training units who can serve as role models and mentors for female trainees.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(J) Review Department of Defense and military department efforts to objectively measure or evaluate the effectiveness of gender-integrated basic training, as compared to gender-segregated basic training, particularly with regard to the adequacy and scope of the efforts and with regard to the relevancy of findings to operational unit requirements, and determine whether the Department of Defense and the military departments are capable of measuring or evaluating the effectiveness of that training format objectively.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(K) Compare the pattern of attrition in gender-integrated basic training units with the pattern of attrition in gender-segregated basic training units and assess the relevancy of the findings of such comparison.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(L) Compare the level of readiness and morale of gender-integrated basic training units with the level of readiness and morale of gender-segregated units, and assess the relevancy of the findings of such comparison and the implications, for readiness, of any differences found.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(M) Compare the experiences, policies, and practices of the armed forces of other industrialized nations regarding gender-integrated training with those of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(N) Review, and take into consideration, the current practices, relevant studies, and private sector training concepts pertaining to gender-integrated training.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(O) Assess the feasibility and implications of conducting basic training (or equivalent training) at the company level and below through separate units for male and female recruits, including the costs and other resource commitments required to implement and conduct basic training in such a manner and the implications for readiness and unit cohesion.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:35 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(P) Assess the feasibility and implications of requiring drill instructors for basic training units to be of the same sex as the recruits in those units if the basic training were to be conducted as described in subparagraph (O).</p>
