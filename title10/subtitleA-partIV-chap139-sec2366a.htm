The Milestone Decision Authority, in consultation with the Joint Requirements Oversight Council on matters related to program requirements and military needs, shall determine whether the level of resources required to develop and procure the program remains consistent with the priority level assigned by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council. The Milestone Decision Authority may withdraw the certification concerned or rescind Milestone A approval if the Milestone Decision Authority determines that such action is in the interest of national defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 30 days after a program manager submits a notification to the Milestone Decision Authority pursuant to paragraph (1) with respect to a major defense acquisition program or designated major subprogram, the Milestone Decision Authority shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report that&mdash;</p>
