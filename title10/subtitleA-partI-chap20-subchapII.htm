<!-- PDFPage:128 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Many of the skills, capabilities, and resources that the Armed Forces have developed to meet military requirements can assist in meeting the civilian domestic needs of the United States.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) As a result of the reductions in the Armed Forces resulting from the ending of the Cold War, the Armed Forces will have fewer overseas deployments and lower operating tempos, and there will be a much greater opportunity than in the past for the Armed Forces to assist civilian efforts to address critical domestic problems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The United States has significant domestic needs in areas such as health care, nutrition, education, housing, and infrastructure that cannot be met by current and anticipated governmental and private sector programs.</p>
