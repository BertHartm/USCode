<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;to serve&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;for the purpose of serving&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;there are not enough *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* that are&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;adequate numbers of *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* are not&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;(other than for training)&rdquo; are inserted, since the words &ldquo;active duty&rdquo; were defined in the source statute cited above to exclude &ldquo;active duty for training&rdquo;.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1962 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">The change is made to conform section 674(a) more closely to the source law for that section, section 206(a) of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 (66 Stat. 483). Section 206(a) of that Act defined the Standby Reserve in terms of units and members of the reserve components according to their liability to be ordered to active duty. It did not provide authority to order units and members of the Standby Reserve to active duty. This authority was provided by section 233(a) of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 (66 Stat. 489), which is restated in section 672(a) of title 10. Since the present language of section 674(a) may be interpreted to provide independent authority to order units and members of the Standby Reserve to active duty, it is revised to make clear that this is not the case and that section 672 is the authority for that action.</p>
