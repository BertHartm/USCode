<p class="statutory-body">(a) A selection board convened under section 573(a) of this title shall recommend for pro<!-- PDFPage:194 -->motion to the next higher grade those warrant officers considered by the board whom the board, giving due consideration to the needs of the armed force concerned for warrant officers with particular skills, considers best qualified for promotion within each grade (or grade and competitive category) considered by the board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In the case of a selection board to consider warrant officers for selection for promotion to the grade of chief warrant officer, W&ndash;3, chief warrant officer, W&ndash;4, or chief warrant officer, W&ndash;5, the Secretary concerned shall establish the number of warrant officers that the selection board may recommend from among warrant officers being considered from below the promotion zone within each grade (or grade and competitive category). The number of warrant officers recommended for promotion from below the promotion zone does not increase the maximum number of warrant officers which the board is authorized under section 574 of this title to recommend for promotion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The number of officers recommended for promotion from below the promotion zone may not exceed 10 percent of the total number recommended, except that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation, when the Coast Guard is not operating as a service in the Navy, may authorize such percentage to be increased to not more than 15 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A selection board convened under section 573(a) of this title may not recommend a warrant officer for promotion unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the officer receives the recommendation of a majority of the members of the board; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a majority of the members of the board find that the officer is fully qualified for promotion.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Each time a selection board is convened under section 573(a) of this title to consider warrant officers in a competitive category for promotion to the next higher grade, each warrant officer in the promotion zone, and each warrant officer above the promotion zone, for the grade and competitive category under consideration (except for a warrant officer precluded from consideration under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned under section 577 of this title) shall be considered for promotion.</p>
