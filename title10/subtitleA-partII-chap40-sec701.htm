<p class="statutory-body">(d) Notwithstanding subsection (b), during the period beginning on October 1, 2008, through September 30, 2013, a member may accumulate up to 75 days of leave.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Leave taken before discharge is considered to be active service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purpose of this subsection, an adoption of a child by a member is a qualifying child adoption if the member is eligible for reimbursement of qualified adoption expenses for such adoption under section 1052 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the event that two members of the armed forces who are married to each other adopt a child in a qualifying child adoption, only one such member shall be allowed leave under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Leave under paragraph (1) is in addition to other leave provided under other provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j)(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, a married member of the armed forces on active duty whose wife gives birth to a child shall receive 10 days of leave to be used in connection with the birth of the child.</p>
