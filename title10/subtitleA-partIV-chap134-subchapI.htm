<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) of this section and sections 2253(b) and 2661(a) of this title are based on Pub. L. 98&ndash;212, title VII, &sect;735, Dec. 8, 1983, 97 Stat. 1444, as amended by Pub. L. 98&ndash;525, title XIV, &sect;&sect;1403(a)(2), 1404, Oct. 19, 1984, 98 Stat. 2621.</p>
<p class="note-body">In two instances, the source section for provisions to be codified provides that defense appropriations may be used for &ldquo;welfare and recreation&rdquo; or &ldquo;welfare and recreational&rdquo; purposes. (Section 735 of Public Law 98&ndash;212 and section 8006(b) of Public Law 99&ndash;190, to be codified as 10 U.S.C. 2241(a)(1) and 2490(2), respectively). The committee added the term &ldquo;morale&rdquo; in both of these two instances to conform to the usual &ldquo;MWR&rdquo; usage for morale, welfare, and recreation activities.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) of this section and sections 2242(1), (4) and 2253(a)(1) of this title are based on Pub. L. 98&ndash;212, title VII, &sect;705, Dec. 8, 1983, 97 Stat. 1437.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 705 of Public Law 98&ndash;212, to be codified as 10 U.S.C. 2241(b), provides that defense appropriations may be used in connection with certain services and supplies &ldquo;as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act&rdquo;. The reference to &ldquo;this Act&rdquo; means Public Law 98&ndash;212, the FY84 Defense Appropriations Act. Language similar to section 705 had been enacted as part of the annual defense appropriation Act for many years. In the FY84 Act, section 705 was enacted as a permanent provision. The quoted phrase above was not, however, revised from the traditional annual wording as the provision had appeared in annual appropriations Acts in order to give it effect beyond the fiscal year concerned. Since the general purpose of a defense appropriations Act is to provide funds for national defense purposes, the committee, in codifying this provision, revised the quoted phrase so as to read &ldquo;that may be necessary for the national defense&rdquo;. No change in meaning is intended.</p>
