<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the disability was not noted at the time of the member's entrance on active duty (unless clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the disability existed before the member's entrance on active duty and was not aggravated by active military service);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the disability is the proximate result of performing active duty;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the disability was incurred in line of duty in time of war or national emergency; or</p>
