<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Necessity for Core Logistics Capability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) It is essential for the national defense that Department of Defense activities maintain a logistics capability (including personnel, equipment, and facilities) to ensure a ready and controlled source of technical competence and resources necessary to ensure effective and timely response to a mobilization, national defense contingency situations, and other emergency requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall identify those logistics activities that are necessary to maintain the logistics capability described in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Contracting</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), performance of a logistics activity identified by the Secretary under subsection (a)(2), and performance of a function of the Department of Defense described in section 1231(b) of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1986 (Public Law 99&ndash;145; 99 Stat. 731), may not be contracted for performance by non-Government personnel under the procedures and requirements of Office of Management and Budget Circular A&ndash;76 or any successor administrative regulation or policy (hereinafter in this section referred to as OMB Circular A&ndash;76).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense may waive paragraph (1) in the case of any such logistics activity or function and provide that performance of such activity or function shall be considered for conversion to contractor performance in accordance with OMB Circular A&ndash;76. Any such waiver shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary and shall be based on a determination by the Secretary that Government performance of the activity or function is no longer required for national defense reasons. Such regulations shall include criteria for determining whether Government performance of any such activity or function is no longer required for national defense reasons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A waiver under paragraph (2) may not take effect until the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the Secretary submits a report on the waiver to the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on National Security and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Policy Regarding Performance of Depot-Level Maintenance and Repair for Department of Defense</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 311 of Pub. L. 104&ndash;106 provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The Department of Defense does not have a comprehensive policy regarding the performance of depot-level maintenance and repair of military equipment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The absence of such a policy has caused the Congress to establish guidelines for the performance of such functions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) It is essential to the national security of the United States that the Department of Defense maintain an organic capability within the department, in<!-- PDFPage:900 -->cluding skilled personnel, technical competencies, equipment, and facilities, to perform depot-level maintenance and repair of military equipment in order to ensure that the Armed Forces of the United States are able to meet training, operational, mobilization, and emergency requirements without impediment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The organic capability of the Department of Defense to perform depot-level maintenance and repair of military equipment must satisfy known and anticipated core maintenance and repair requirements across the full range of peacetime and wartime scenarios.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Although it is possible that savings can be achieved by contracting with private-sector sources for the performance of some work currently performed by Department of Defense depots, the Department of Defense has not determined the type or amount of work that should be performed under contract with private-sector sources nor the relative costs and benefits of contracting for the performance of such work by those sources.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Sense of Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that there is a compelling need for the Department of Defense to articulate known and anticipated core maintenance and repair requirements, to organize the resources of the Department of Defense to meet those requirements economically and efficiently, and to determine what work should be performed by the private sector and how such work should be managed.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Requirement for Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than March 31, 1996, the Secretary of Defense shall develop and report to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives a comprehensive policy on the performance of depot-level maintenance and repair for the Department of Defense that maintains the capability described in section 2464 of title 10, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Content of Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In developing the policy, the Secretary of Defense shall do each of the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Identify for each military department, with the concurrence of the Secretary of that military department, those depot-level maintenance and repair activities that are necessary to ensure the depot-level maintenance and repair capability as required by section 2464 of title 10, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Provide for performance of core depot-level maintenance and repair capabilities in facilities owned and operated by the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Provide for the core capabilities to include sufficient skilled personnel, equipment, and facilities that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) is of the proper size (i) to ensure a ready and controlled source of technical competence and repair and maintenance capability necessary to meet the requirements of the National Military Strategy and other requirements for responding to mobilizations and military contingencies, and (ii) to provide for rapid augmentation in time of emergency; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) is assigned sufficient workload to ensure cost efficiency and technical proficiency in time of peace.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Address environmental liability.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) In the case of depot-level maintenance and repair workloads in excess of the workload required to be performed by Department of Defense depots, provide for competition for those workloads between public and private entities when there is sufficient potential for realizing cost savings based on adequate private-sector competition and technical capabilities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Address issues concerning exchange of technical data between the Federal Government and the private sector.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Provide for, in the Secretary's discretion and after consultation with the Secretaries of the military departments, the transfer from one military department to another, in accordance with merit-based selection processes, workload that supports the core depot-level maintenance and repair capabilities in facilities owned and operated by the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Require that, in any competition for a workload (whether among private-sector sources or between depot-level activities of the Department of Defense and private-sector sources), bids are evaluated under a methodology that ensures that appropriate costs to the Government and the private sector are identified.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Provide for the performance of maintenance and repair for any new weapons systems defined as core, under section 2464 of title 10, United States Code, in facilities owned and operated by the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) <cap-smallcap>Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In developing the policy, the Secretary shall take into consideration the following matters:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The national security interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The capabilities of the public depots and the capabilities of businesses in the private sector to perform the maintenance and repair work required by the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Any applicable recommendations of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission that are required to be implemented under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 [part A of title XXIX of div. B of Pub. L. 101&ndash;510, set out as a note under section 2687 of this title].</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The extent to which the readiness of the Armed Forces would be affected by a necessity to construct new facilities to accommodate any redistribution of depot-level maintenance and repair workloads that is made in accordance with the recommendation of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, that such workloads be consolidated at Department of Defense depots or private-sector facilities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Analyses of costs and benefits of alternatives, including a comparative analysis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the costs and benefits, including any readiness implications, of any proposed policy to convert to contractor performance of depot-level maintenance and repair workloads where the workload is being performed by Department of Defense personnel; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) the costs and benefits, including any readiness implications, of a policy to transfer depot-level maintenance and repair workloads among depots.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(f) <cap-smallcap>Repeal of</cap-smallcap> 60/40 <cap-smallcap>Requirement and Requirement Relating to Competition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) [Repealed sections 2466 and 2469 of this title.]</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) [Amended analysis of chapter 146 of this title.]</p>
