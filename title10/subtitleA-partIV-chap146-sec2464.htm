<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Necessity for Core Logistics Capabilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) It is essential for the national defense that the Department of Defense maintain a core logistics capability that is Government-owned and Government-operated (including Government personnel and Government-owned and Government-operated equipment and facilities) to ensure a ready and controlled source of technical competence and resources necessary to ensure effective and timely response to a mobilization, national defense contingency situations, and other emergency requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall identify the core logistics capabilities described in paragraph (1) and the workload required to maintain those capabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The core logistics capabilities identified under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall include those capabilities that are necessary to maintain and repair the weapon systems and other military equipment (including mission-essential weapon systems or materiel not later than four years after achieving initial operational capability, but excluding systems and equipment under special access programs, nuclear aircraft carriers, and commercial items described in paragraph (5)) that are identified by the Secretary, in consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as necessary to enable the armed forces to fulfill the strategic and contingency plans prepared by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under section 153(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of Defense shall require the performance of core logistics workloads necessary to maintain the core logistics capabilities identified under paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) at Government-owned, Government-operated facilities of the Department of Defense (including Government-owned, Government-operated facilities of a military department) and shall assign such facilities sufficient workload to ensure cost efficiency and technical competence in peacetime while preserving the surge capacity and reconstitution capabilities necessary to support fully the strategic and contingency plans referred to in paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The commercial items covered by paragraph (3) are commercial items that have been sold or leased in substantial quantities to the general public and are purchased without modification in the same form that they are sold in the commercial marketplace, or with minor modifications to meet Federal Government requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Contracting</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), performance of workload needed to maintain a logistics capability identified by the Secretary under subsection (a)(2) may not be contracted for performance by non-Government personnel under the procedures and requirements of Office of Management and Budget Circular A&ndash;76 or any successor administrative regulation or policy (hereinafter in this section referred to as OMB Circular A&ndash;76).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense may waive paragraph (1) in the case of any such logistics capability and provide that performance of the workload needed to maintain that capability shall be considered for conversion to contractor performance in accordance with OMB Circular A&ndash;76. Any such waiver shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary and shall be based on a determination by the Secretary that Government performance of the workload is no longer required for national defense reasons. Such regulations shall include criteria for determining whether Government performance of any such workload is no longer required for national defense reasons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) A waiver under paragraph (2) may not take effect until the expiration of the first period of 30 days of continuous session of Congress that begins on or after the date on which the Secretary submits a report on the waiver to the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Notification of Determinations Regarding Certain Commercial Items</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The first time that a weapon system or other item of military equipment described in subsection (a)(3) is determined to be a commercial item for the purposes of the exception contained in that subsection, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a notification of the determination, together with the justification for the determination. The justification for the determination shall include, at a minimum, the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The estimated percentage of commonality of parts of the version of the item that is sold or leased in the commercial marketplace and the Government's version of the item.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The value of any unique support and test equipment and tools that are necessary to support the military requirements if the item were maintained by the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A comparison of the estimated life cycle logistics support costs that would be incurred by the Government if the item were maintained by the private sector with the estimated life cycle logistics support costs that <!-- PDFPage:1346 -->would be incurred by the Government if the item were maintained by the Government.</p>
