<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Necessity for Core Depot-level Maintenance and Repair Capabilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) It is essential for national security that the Department of Defense maintain a core depot-level maintenance and repair capability, as defined by this title, in support of mission-essential weapon systems or items of military equipment needed to directly support combatant command operational requirements and enable the armed forces to execute the strategic, contingency, and emergency plans prepared by the Department of Defense, as required under section 153(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This core depot-level maintenance and repair capability shall be Government-owned and Government-operated, including the use of Government personnel and Government-owned and Government-operated equipment and facilities, throughout the lifecycle of the weapon system or item of military equipment involved to ensure a ready and controlled source of technical competence and resources necessary to ensure effective and timely response to a mobilization, national defense contingency situations, and other emergency requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subsection (c), the Secretary of Defense shall identify and establish the core depot-level maintenance and repair capabilities and capacity required in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Core depot-level maintenance and repair capabilities and capacity, including the facilities, equipment, associated logistics capabilities, technical data, and trained personnel, shall be established not later than four years after a weapon system or item of military equipment achieves initial operational capability or is fielded in support of operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of Defense shall assign Government-owned and Government-operated depot-level maintenance and repair facilities of the Department of Defense sufficient workload to ensure cost efficiency and technical competence in peacetime, while preserving the ability to <!-- PDFPage:1487 -->provide an effective and timely response to a mobilization, national defense contingency situations, and other emergency requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Waiver Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense may waive the requirement in subsection (a)(3) if the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the weapon system or item of military equipment is not an enduring element of the national defense strategy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of nuclear aircraft carrier refueling, fulfilling the requirement is not economically feasible; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) it is in the best interest of national security.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of a military department may waive the requirement in subsection (a)(3) for special access programs if such a waiver is determined to be in the best interest of the United States.</p>

The justification for the determination shall include, at a minimum, the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The value of any unique support and test equipment and tools needed to support the military requirements if the item were maintained by the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A comparison of the estimated life-cycle depot-level maintenance and repair support costs that would be incurred by the Government if the item were maintained by the private sector with the estimated life-cycle depot-level maintenance support costs that would be incurred by the Government if the item were maintained by the Department of Defense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In this subsection, the term &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; means an end-item, assembly, subassembly, or part sold or leased in substantial quantities to the general public and purchased by the Department of Defense without modification in the same form that they are sold in the commercial marketplace, or with minor modifications to meet Federal Government requirements.</p>

Any such waiver shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary and shall be based on a determination by the Secretary that Government performance of the workload is no longer required for national defense reasons. Such regulations shall include criteria for determining whether Government performance of any such workload is no longer required for national defense reasons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) A waiver under paragraph (2) may not take effect until the expiration of the first period of 30 days of continuous session of Congress that begins on or after the date on which the Secretary submits a report on the waiver to the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives.</p>
