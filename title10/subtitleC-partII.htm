<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">This section is derived from the distribution-in-grade provisions of the Officers Personnel Act of 1947. It is inserted here to show clearly what is meant by the &ldquo;authorized number&rdquo; of officers in a grade as used in the distribution-in-grade sections of the Officer Personnel Act. &ldquo;Prescribed number&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;authorized number&rdquo; because the latter, as used in other provisions of law, means simply the maximum number of persons authorized to be in a designated category. As used in the distribution-in-grade provisions of the Officer Personnel Act the term means not only the maximum number of officers that may be in a particular grade, but also the number of officers that should be maintained in that grade. It places not only a ceiling but a floor on the number of officers for the grade concerned. This is accomplished by establishing vacancies when the actual number of officers in the grade concerned falls below the &ldquo;authorized&rdquo; or, as used here, the &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; number. Where there is a prescribed number for a grade, an officer should, in the absence of other controlling provisions of law, be promoted to that grade to fill an existing vacancy, as of the date on which the vacancy occurred. In this manner, at least constructively, the prescribed number is maintained.</p>
<p class="note-body">There is no source for the section because the Officer Personnel Act did not attempt specifically to define &ldquo;authorized number&rdquo; in this context. The meaning of the term is derived only from understanding the effect given it throughout the Officer Personnel Act and from the imperative requirements of sections 103, 203, and 303 of the act.</p>

<p class="note-body">The Act of July 24, 1941, ch. 320, as amended (34 U.S.C. 350 et seq.), and &sect;413 of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 (34 U.S.C. 211d) provide for the temporary appointment of officers to grades up to and including admiral. Staff corps officers, women officers, and reserve officers are not excluded from the operation of the provisions of the 1941 Act. Since authority exists for the appointment of officers of any category in any grade in the Navy, the existence of every grade in the several staff corps and in the Naval Reserve is recognized, and the restriction of these grades to the active list of the line is removed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The grade of Fleet Admiral is omitted inasmuch as the law authorizing appointments in this grade was limited.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;above the grade of chief warrant officer, W&ndash;4&rdquo; are inserted for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c) is added to make clear the fact that an officer serving in a position, such as chief of bureau, which entitles him to the rank, pay, and allowances of a rear admiral of the upper half ranks rear admirals receiving the pay and allowances of the lower half even though he has not been appointed to the grade of rear admiral or, if so appointed, is in the lower half. A statement of this fact is necessary to give full effect to 5 U.S.C. 441 which provides that chiefs of bureaus of the Navy Department and the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, while so serving, shall have &ldquo;corresponding rank and shall receive the same pay and allowances *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* as *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* chiefs of bureaus of the War Department and the Judge Advocate General of the Army&rdquo;. The rank so conferred, corresponding to the Army rank of major general, is rear admiral of the upper half. In &sect;&sect;5133 and 5148 of this title, based on 5 U.S.C. 441, the reference to the Army rank is eliminated and the corresponding Navy rank is substituted. The substitution is made because, as stated in the revision notes on those sections, the creation of the Department of the Air Force and the reorganization of the Department of the Army make it impracticable to continue to relate Navy Department positions to former War Department positions. This treatment of 5 U.S.C. 441 does not, however, completely cover the question of the rank, in relation to other officers in the Navy and other services, of a captain or rear admiral of the lower half who by virtue of his position becomes entitled to the rank, pay, and allowances of a rear admiral of the upper half. Under 34 U.S.C. 241a officers holding <em>commissions</em> in the grade of rear admiral rank with major generals if entitled to the pay of the upper half and with brigadier generals if entitled to the pay of the lower half. Under 5 U.S.C. 441 bureau chiefs and the Judge Advocate General rank with major generals regardless of the grade in which they hold commissions and, therefore, also rank all officers of the Navy who are ranked by major generals. This fact, obscured by the substitution of Navy rank in the codification of 5 U.S.C. 441, is set out in subsection (c).</p>

<p class="note-body">This section is included in subtitle C for completeness and clarity. In duplicates, in part, &sect;&sect;555 and 597 of this title, which cover, respectively, the &ldquo;permanent regular warrant officer grades&rdquo; and the &ldquo;permanent reserve warrant officer grades&rdquo; in the armed forces. The concept that regular grades differ from reserve grades and that a grade held under a permanent appointment differs from the grade of the same name held under a temporary appointment is foreign to the naval service. In the Navy and the Marine Corps, all officers serving, for example, in the grade of chief warrant officer, W&ndash;4, are considered to be serving in the same grade regardless of whether they are Regulars or Reserves and regardless of whether they are temporary or permanent officers holding temporary or permanent appointments in that grade. This section, therefore, lists the four warrant officer grades as applicable to all warrant officers of the naval service.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;the senior officer present afloat&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;the commanding officer of any fleet, squadron, or vessel acting singly&rdquo; to modernize the terminology. At the time of the enactment of the Revised Statutes the word &ldquo;squadron&rdquo; meant an organization of any number of vessels more than one, so that all cases were covered by R.S. 1422. The concept of &ldquo;senior officer present afloat&rdquo;, today, covers as nearly as possible the current equivalent of the concept in the original section. The words &ldquo;in foreign waters&rdquo; are inserted to conform to the interpretation of the Supreme Court in <em>Wilkes</em> v. <em>Dinsman</em>, 7 How. 89 (1849). The words &ldquo;on service&rdquo; are omitted, as they have no current ascertainable meaning. The words &ldquo;by Government or other transportation&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;in some public or other vessel&rdquo;, since this provision is interpreted as directing transportation by either ship or aircraft. The words &ldquo;to the United States&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;to an Atlantic or to a Pacific port of the United States, as their enlistment may have occurred on either the Atlantic or Pacific coast, of the United States&rdquo; because aircraft now land at inland airports as well as coastal airports and the duty to return an enlisted member to the United States under this provision is considered complete upon the member's arrival in the United States. The extensive transportation system in the United States presently obviates the necessity of returning a member to a particular area. Furthermore, under 37 U.S.C. 253, the Government bears the cost of transporting the discharged member to his home or to the place from which he was called to active duty. The words &ldquo;enlisted member of the naval service&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;all petty officers and persons of inferior ratings&rdquo; in accordance with present terminology. Members of the Marine Corps are included because of inter<!-- PDFPage:1599 -->pretations of the Comptroller General, in construing the language of the statute. (14 Comp. Gen. 807, 808, May 1, 1935.) The reference to persons enlisted without the limits of the United States is omitted as unnecessary, since return to the United States is optional with the member and the basic rule applies irrespective of place of enlistment. The language requiring that persons who are detained or sent home be subject to the laws and regulations for the Government of the Navy is omitted as unnecessary in view of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The provision referring to reentry to serve until the vessel returns to the United States is omitted because no law authorizes entry or reentry into the service for this restricted purpose.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the words &ldquo;an increase in basic pay of 25 percent&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;an addition of one-fourth of their former pay&rdquo; in conformity with the Career Compensation Act of 1949. 34 U.S.C. 201b permanently suspended the detention pay increase in time of war and this effect is expressed in subsection (b)(2) by the words &ldquo;except in time of war&rdquo;. 34 U.S.C. 201a, declaring that the pay addition authorized by this section does not apply to enlistments extended under other provisions of law, is omitted as unnecessary, since the increased pay provision is specifically limited to detentions under this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c) the term &ldquo;enlistment contract&rdquo; is substituted for the term &ldquo;shipping-articles&rdquo; to conform to present terminology.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under such regulations as he may prescribe, the Secretary of the Navy may make temporary appointments of officers designated for limited duty in the Regular Navy in grades not above lieutenant and in the Regular Marine Corps in grades not above captain from sources authorized under section 5589 of this title. Such appointments shall be made by warrant if in the grade of warrant officer, W&ndash;1, and by commission if in a higher grade.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Temporary appointments under this section do not change the permanent, probationary, or acting status of members so appointed, prejudice them in regard to promotion or appointment, or abridge their rights or benefits. A person receiving a temporary appointment under this section may not suffer any reduction in the pay and allowances to which he was entitled because of his permanent status at the time of his temporary appointment, or any reduction in the pay and allowances to which he was entitled under a prior temporary appointment in a lower grade.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The following members of the naval service are ineligible for temporary appointments under this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Retired members.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Members of the Naval Reserve and the Marine Corps Reserve ordered to active duty for training.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Members of the Naval Reserve and the Marine Corps Reserve ordered to active duty in connection with organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, training, or drilling the Naval Reserve or the Marine Corps Reserve.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Members of the Naval Reserve and the Marine Corps Reserve ordered to temporary active duty to prosecute special work.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Officers designated for limited duty under subsection (a) may be temporarily appointed by the Secretary of the Navy in a higher grade not above commander in the Regular Navy or lieutenant colonel in the Regular Marine Corps under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe. Regulations prescribed under this section shall to the greatest extent practicable conform to the procedures prescribed in chapter 36 of this title for selection for promotion and promotion to higher permanent grades.</p>

<p class="note-body">Since appointments under this section are either made, or not made, in the discretion of the President, the proviso of 34 U.S.C. 3d, authorizing the President to suspend the operation of this section with respect to lieutenants (junior grade) and lieutenants in the Navy and first lieutenants and captains in the Marine Corps, is omitted from subsection (a) as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (b) and (c) the words &ldquo;and above&rdquo; have been executed by naming the grades they imply, to wit, chief petty officers and master and technical sergeants. In the statement of the grades to which appointments may be made, the words &ldquo;including the grades of warrant officer and commissioned warrant officer&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. In the list of persons who may be appointed, reference to commissioned warrant officers is omitted because they are included within the term &ldquo;warrant officers&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f) the words &ldquo;do not change the *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* status&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;appointments *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* shall not be vacated.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;advancement&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;in accordance with laws relating to the Regular Navy or Marine Corps&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;privileges and gratuities&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The first proviso is omitted as unnecessary in view of the Career Compensation Act of 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (g)(2) that portion of 34 U.S.C. 3c(a) which excludes officers on the retired list from the definition of the word &ldquo;officers&rdquo; is treated as precluding the appointment of such officers under this section. There is no express statement of law making retired enlisted members ineligible for such appointments; however, the context indicates this to be the intent of Congress. In subsection (g)(3) that portion of 34 U.S.C. 3c(a) which excludes officers on active duty for training from the definition of the word &ldquo;officers&rdquo; is treated as precluding the appointment of persons on training duty under this section. While there is no statement of law making enlisted members of the Naval Reserve and the Marine Corps Reserve on active duty for training ineligible for appointments under this section, the context indicates this to be the intent of Congress and clause (3) is thus written. The exception as to the Fleet Reserve is omitted as unnecessary inasmuch as, pursuant to the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952, the Fleet Reserve is no longer a part of the Naval Reserve but is a separate and distinct component of the Navy.</p>

<p class="note-body">The provision of &sect;7 of the Act of March 3, 1899 (supra), relating to relative rank is omitted as executed. The provision that the rank conferred upon staff corps officers shall not change their titles is omitted because these titles were abolished by &sect;405 of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 (34 U.S.C. 10a) and the corresponding line grades substituted. The cited proviso in the Act of June 24, 1910 (34 U.S.C. 253 (proviso)) is omitted as obsolete because the officers referred to were officers of the Construction Corps which has been abolished.</p>
<p class="note-body">The first sentence of this section is phrased so as to reflect the accepted meaning of the cited provision. 34 U.S.C. 253, as worded, if interpreted literally, could be held to prohibit, for example, the assignment of members of the Medical Service Corps, Nurse Corps, and Hospital Corps to duty under officers of the Medical Corps, despite the fact that all of these corps were established by law within the Medical Department of the Navy. The provision is not so interpreted. It is understood to restrict only the types of activities that staff corps officers may command, and not to restrict to a single corps the personnel who may be assigned to an activity commanded by a staff corps officer.</p>

<p class="note-body">So much of 34 U.S.C. 901a as authorizes a commuted ration for enlisted members of the naval service under conditions and at rates prescribed by the Secretary of the Navy is superseded by &sect;301 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 251). That section established a basic allowance for subsistence for enlisted members entitled to basic pay who are not subsisting at Government expense and prescribes the conditions under which the basic allowance for subsistence shall be paid and the amount of the allowance. Pursuant to Executive Order No. 10119, March 30, 1950, 15 F.R. 1757, the Secretary of Defense is authorized to make supplemental regulations to carry out the provisions of &sect;301. The words &ldquo;or to a per diem in place of subsistence&rdquo; are inserted to reflect the subsistence allowance authorized by &sect;303(a) of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 253a) to members in travel status.</p>

The words &ldquo;and cadets&rdquo; are omitted as there are no cadets in the Navy or Marine Corps entitled to a Navy ration. Aviation cadets are entitled to the basic allowance for subsistence prescribed for officers (34 U.S.C. 850c).</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) reference to R.S. 4813 (24 U.S.C. 6) is omitted because the Administrator of Veterans&rsquo; Affairs held in Decision Number 571 (July 27, 1944) that R.S. 4813 was repealed by implication. Since this decision is binding on the Secretary of the Navy (see 38 U.S.C. 11a&ndash;2), the deductions from pension accounts authorized by R.S. 4813 may not be made.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c) the words &ldquo;each retired enlisted member of the naval service&rdquo; are substituted for the <!-- PDFPage:1627 -->words &ldquo;retired enlisted men&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;is entitled to&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;shall receive&rdquo; to conform to terminology used throughout this title. The words &ldquo;equal in value to the hospital ration&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;prescribed by law for enlisted men of the Regular Navy&rdquo; to show that the amount of the allowance is the value of the hospital ration. The words &ldquo;for each day&rdquo; are inserted to make it clear that the ration allowance is credited on a daily basis. The words &ldquo;under this section&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;in a Federal hospital in accordance with law&rdquo; because this section is the only authority for the hospitalization of members of the Fleet Reserve and Fleet Marine Corps Reserve and retired enlisted members of the naval service in Federal hospitals, other than naval hospitals, under conditions entitling the members to a ration allowance. The subsistence of a member of the Fleet Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve or a retired enlisted member of the naval service while hospitalized in naval hospitals is covered by &sect;6086 of this title.</p>

The decision of the Comptroller General of December 23, 1949 (B&ndash;91297), has not been overlooked. That decision, without passing on a case in which the point was involved, indicated that the transportation entitlement in 34 U.S.C. 900a might be impliedly repealed by the Career Compensation Act of 1949. The editors of the United States Code Annotated, apparently on the basis of this decision, have omitted 34 U.S.C.A. 900a from the 1954 pocket part. A conclusion that the section is repealed, however, defeats the specific purpose of the provision, which, as indicated in the legislative hearings, was to insure that underage dischargees would be transported home and not simply released at the place of discharge.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) An officer of the Navy or the Marine Corps who applies for retirement after completing more than 20 years of active service, of which at least 10 years was service as a commissioned officer, may, in the discretion of the President, be retired on the first day of any month designated by the President.</p>

<p class="note-body">The Act of April 14, 1949 (34 U.S.C. 410b&ndash;1), extending the benefits of 34 U.S.C. 410b to officers on the honorary retired lists, was enacted because the Comptroller General had held that these officers, being already in a retired status, could not be retired under 34 U.S.C. 410b (U.S. Code Congressional Service, 1949, p. 1179). The provisions of the Naval Reserve Act of 1938 relating to the honorary retired lists were repealed by &sect;803 of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952, but insofar as they provided for retirement and retired pay they were reenacted, for a period of 20 years, in &sect;413 of that act (50 U.S.C. 1052). Persons on the honorary retired lists when the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 was passed were transferred to the appropriate Retired Reserve under &sect;213 of the Act. Persons qualifying for retirement under &sect;413 are likewise placed in the Retired Reserve. The purpose of Congress in enacting &sect;413 was to preserve the accrued rights of persons who were members of reserve components on January 1, 1953, the effective date of the Act (U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News, 1952, p. 3584). One of their rights was the right to apply for retirement under 34 U.S.C. 410b upon completion of the required service, notwithstanding the fact that, before qualifying for retirement under that section, they had already acquired a retired status. Subsection (c) is worded accordingly.</p>

<p class="note-body">Title III of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 authorizes temporary promotions to the grades of lieutenant through rear admiral. The purpose of &sect;316(j) of that act (34 U.S.C. 410m) was to insure that each officer who is temporarily promoted under that Title, and who retires before he receives a permanent appointment in the grade in which he is serving, will be considered, for the purposes of the laws relating to retired grade and pay, to be serving in the grade he holds pursuant to his temporary appointment. Since &sect;5001 of this title provides that an officer who holds a permanent appointment in one grade and a temporary appointment in a higher grade is considered as serving in the higher grade, a restatement of the substance of &sect;316(j) is unnecessary and is omitted from subsection (a). The words &ldquo;retired other than by reason of physical disability incurred in line of duty&rdquo;, in 34 U.S.C. 43g(d) and (f) and 34 U.S.C. 410r(g), are omitted as unnecessary, since this section relates only to officers who are voluntarily retired under this chapter. The words &ldquo;basic pay to which he would be entitled if serving on active duty in the grade in which retired&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;active-duty pay with longevity credit of the rank with which retired&rdquo; in 34 U.S.C. 410c(a), for the words &ldquo;active-duty pay to which entitled at the time of retirement&rdquo; in 34 U.S.C. 43g(d), and for the words &ldquo;active-duty pay to which she would be entitled if serving, at the time of retirement, on active duty in the rank in which placed upon the retired list&rdquo; in 34 U.S.C. 43g(f) and 34 U.S.C. 410r(g), to make clear the fact that the amount of retired pay is not permanently fixed at the time of retirement but is subject to change when rates of basic pay are changed, as provided in 34 U.S.C. 410q. The words &ldquo;basic pay&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;active-duty pay&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;creditable for basic pay&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;for which entitled to credit in the computation of her active-duty pay&rdquo;, and for the words &ldquo;for which entitled to credit in the computation of their pay while on active duty&rdquo; to conform to the terminology used in the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Unlike provisions of law authorizing retirement on various other grounds, R.S. 1443, which provides for the retirement of officers on their own application after 40 years of service, contains no provisions as to retired pay. R.S. 1588 provided, inter alia, that officers so retired should received retired pay at the rate of 75 percent of the sea pay of their respective grades, but that section was expressly repealed by &sect;531(a)(7) of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, leaving no specific provision for the retired pay of officers retired under R.S. 1443. It would be absurd to assume, however, that Congress intended that an officer having 40 years of service should be retired without pay, when he could have been retired with pay at any time within the preceding 20 years. By the repeal of R.S. 1588 Congress intended merely to remove obsolete and superseded provisions as to retirement at age 62 and retirement after 45 years of service, references to sea pay, and provisions, inconsistent with later law, for half pay for officers retired for other reasons. Congress intended the retired pay of officers retired after 40 years of service to be computed according to the formula prescribed generally for retired officers, other than for officers retired by reason of physical disability, and this section is worded accordingly.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is added for clarity. With respect to officers appointed under &sect;&sect;5231 or 5232 of this title it represents a necessary inference from 34 U.S.C. 410<em>o</em> and 623b(e), codified in &sect;5233 of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the word &ldquo;Regular&rdquo; is inserted before the words &ldquo;Navy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Marine Corps&rdquo; to reflect the longstanding interpretation that 34 U.S.C. 431 applies only to members of the Regular Navy and Regular Marine Corps. So much of the Act of March 2, 1907, ch. 2515, &sect;1 (34 U.S.C. 431), as pertains to allowances and rations was expressly repealed by the Act of June 16, 1942, ch. 413, 56 Stat. 369. The words &ldquo;active service in the armed forces&rdquo; are substituted for 34 U.S.C. 432 for brevity. The reference to the former Revenue Cutter Service in 34 U.S.C. 432 is omitted as obsolete, inasmuch as that Service was absorbed by the Coast Guard in 1915. If there are any enlisted men not yet retired who served in the Revenue Cutter Service, their right to count that service for the purpose of this section is protected by the saving provisions accompanying this title. The reference to active service in the Civil or Spanish-American War in 34 U.S.C. 432 is omitted as obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is inserted to cover into the section permanent enlisted members who are temporarily appointed to commissioned or warrant grades.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the word &ldquo;Federal&rdquo; is omitted and the words &ldquo;in the armed forces, other than active duty for training&rdquo; are inserted. The words &ldquo;active Federal service&rdquo; are not defined in 50 U.S.C. 1052. Section 310 of the Naval Reserve Act of 1938, which 50 U.S.C. 1052 replaced, specifies active service in the &ldquo;Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Naval Auxiliary Service, Naval Reserve Force, Naval Militia in Federal status, National Naval Volunteers, Naval Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve Force, and Marine Corps Reserve.&rdquo; 50 U.S.C. 1052 was intended to preserve the rights of persons who, on January 1, 1953, were members of reserve components, so that they would not be prejudiced by the repeal of &sect;310 of the Naval Reserve Act of 1938 (U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News, 1952, p. 3584). To effect that purpose, the service that was creditable under the 1938 Act must be creditable under 50 U.S.C. 1052. The words &ldquo;active service in the armed forces, other than active duty for training&rdquo; cover all creditable service. The Judge Advocate General of the Navy, in an opinion dated August 27, 1954 (JAG II:2:WGA:CA:mk), held that active duty for training was not creditable under the 1938 Act and is, therefore, not creditable under the 1952 Act.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;officers&rdquo; and &ldquo;assigned&rdquo; are omitted, since they are applicable only to the proviso in 34 U.S.C. 854, which is recommended for repeal as obsolete. (See Table 2A.) The words &ldquo;including (a) those former members of the Fleet Reserve who were transferred *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* but before the expiration of three months following discharge&rdquo;, appearing in &sect;803 of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 505 (34 U.S.C. 854 (note)) are omitted as surplusage. These words merely illustrate the class of persons transferred to the Fleet Reserve under the Naval Reserve Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1178, as referred to in the section from which these words were taken, and in no way limit that class or impose a citizenship requirement for membership in it. (See the opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, JAG:II:1:JFG:imz of February 17, 1953.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) reference to the date July 1, 1925, is omitted, since members who were in the naval service on or before that date may, if they are qualified and so elect, be transferred to the Fleet Reserve or to the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve under 34 U.S.C. 854c instead of under 34 U.S.C. 854b, as provided in the fifth proviso of 34 U.S.C. 854c. That proviso and the provisions of 34 U.S.C. 854b, which are applicable only to persons who were in the naval service in 1925, are not codified because they relate to a small closed class and are therefore of limited interest. They are not repealed, however. (See Table 2D.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (b) and (c) the term &ldquo;active service in the armed forces&rdquo; is substituted for the term &ldquo;active Federal service&rdquo; to execute the definition in the last sentence of 34 U.S.C. 854c.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c) the words &ldquo;is entitled, when not on active duty, to retainer pay at the rate of 21/2 percent of the basic pay that he received at the time of transfer&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;except when on active duty, shall be paid at the annual rate of 21/2 per centum of the annual base and longevity pay they are receiving at the time of transfer&rdquo; to conform to the terminology of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.).</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is worded so as to cover all members of the Fleet Reserve and the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve regardless of the law under which they attained that status. A member transferring under 34 U.S.C. 854b may count only active naval service in computing the service required for that transfer, but in determining his eligibility for retirement he may add to his active naval service all previous active or inactive service in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or Coast Guard, and his time in the Fleet Reserve. A member transferring to the Fleet Reserve under 34 U.S.C. 854c may count active service in any armed force toward that transfer, and he determines his eligibility for re<!-- PDFPage:1645 -->tirement by adding to the service credited to him at the time of transfer any previous inactive service in the armed forces and his time in the Fleet Reserve. As to the latter member the words &ldquo;active service&rdquo; in clause (2) are superfluous, since such service would have been credited to him upon his transfer to the Fleet Reserve, but they are needed in the case of a member transferred under 34 U.S.C. 854b.</p>

<p class="note-body">The second proviso in &sect;312(g) of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 (34 U.S.C. 410j(g)), relating to the retired pay of officers commissioned in the Regular Navy under the Act of April 18, 1946, ch. 141, as amended (34 U.S.C. 15), and officers commissioned in the Regular Navy while serving on active duty as officers of the Naval Reserve, is not codified in this section because it is inapplicable to officers designated for limited duty. The only authority to appoint limited duty officers is &sect;404(a) of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 (34 U.S.C. 211c(a)). Naval Reserve officers are not eligible for such appointments.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Subject to section 12645 of this title, an officer in an active status in the Naval Reserve in the permanent grade of lieutenant or lieutenant (junior grade), and an officer in an active status in the Marine Corps Reserve in the permanent grade of captain or first lieutenant, who is considered as having twice failed of selection for promotion to the next higher grade while on the active-duty list may, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Navy, be eliminated from an active status or released from active duty and placed on the reserve active-status list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) An officer who is to be eliminated from an active status under subsection (a) shall, if qualified, be given an opportunity to request transfer to the appropriate Retired Reserve and, if he requests it, shall be so transferred. If he is not so transferred, he shall, in the discretion of the Secretary, be transferred to the appropriate inactive status list or be discharged from the Naval Reserve or the Marine Corps Reserve.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) An officer in an active status in the Naval Reserve in the permanent grade of lieutenant commander or commander, and an officer in an active status in the Marine Corps Reserve in the permanent grade of major or lieutenant <!-- PDFPage:1653 -->colonel, who is considered as having twice failed of selection for promotion to the next higher grade while on the active-duty list shall, if qualified, be given an opportunity to request transfer to the appropriate Retired Reserve. If he is not so transferred, he shall be discharged from the Naval Reserve or the Marine Corps Reserve if he has completed a period of total commissioned service equal to that specified below for the permanent grade in which he is serving:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the first sentence of paragraph (1), the Secretary may defer the retirement or discharge of such number of officers serving in the grade of lieutenant commander as are necessary to maintain the authorized officer strength of the Ready Reserve, but the duration of such deferment for any individual officer may not be in excess of five years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Secretary may defer the retirement or discharge under this subsection of an officer serving in the permanent grade of lieutenant commander or commander in the Naval Reserve or in the permanent grade of major or lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps Reserve for a period of time which does not exceed the amount of service in an active status which was credited to the officer at the time of his original appointment or thereafter under any provision of law, if the officer can complete at least 20 years of service as computed under section 12732 of this title during the period of such deferment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Secretary may defer the retirement or discharge under this subsection of such number of officers serving in the permanent grade of commander in the Medical Corps, Chaplain Corps, or Dental Corps in the Naval Reserve as are necessary to provide for mobilization requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) For the purposes of subsection (c), the total commissioned service of an officer who has served continuously in the Naval Reserve or the Marine Corps Reserve following appointment therein in the permanent grade of ensign or second lieutenant, as the case may be, shall be computed from June 30 of the fiscal year in which he accepted the appointment. Each other officer is considered to have for this purpose as much total commissioned service as the years of active commissioned service of any regular officer on the active-duty list of the Navy not restricted in the performance of duty, or any regular officer on the active-duty list of the Marine Corps not restricted in the performance of duty, as appropriate, who has served continuously since original appointment as an ensign on the active-duty list of the Navy or as a second lieutenant on the active-duty list of the Marine Corps, has not lost numbers or precedence, and is, or has been after September 6, 1947, junior to that other officer. However, the total commissioned service that the other officer is considered to have may not be less than the actual number of years he has served as a commissioned officer in a grade above chief warrant officer, W&ndash;5.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;who is considered as having twice failed of selection for promotion&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;after failing of selection for promotion *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* a second time&rdquo; to conform to similar statements in this title. (See the revision note on section 5776.) The words &ldquo;may be retained in&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage, since the authority to eliminate such officers from an active status is discretionary with the Secretary.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (e) is added to avoid conflict with 50:1311(d) and (e), codified in sections 6397 and 6403 of this title. 50:1311(d) and (e) contain special provisions for &ldquo;women officers&rdquo; and officers in the Nurse Corps, respectively, so that officers in these categories must be excepted from this section. Women officers appointed under the act of June 24, 1952, ch. 457 (66 Stat. 155; 34 U.S.C. 21e) (codified in section 5581 of this title), are not &ldquo;women officers&rdquo; within the meaning of 50:1311(d), however, but are required to be promoted, retired, or eliminated from active status as if they were men. (See the revision note on section 5665 of this title.) The application of this section to these officers is therefore made explicit.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) states the general rule that a retired officer, when recalled to active duty, shall be recalled in the grade he holds on the retired list. The rule is derived, not from a specific provision of law, but from the fact that special legislative authority is required to recall a retired officer in any other grade.</p>
<p class="note-body">The desirability of including a positive statement of the rule is pointed up by the legislative history of the Act of February 21, 1946, ch. 34, &sect;8(a), 60 Stat. 28, amending the Act of July 24, 1941, ch. 320, &sect;10(d), 55 Stat. 605 (34 U.S.C. 350i(d)). The 1946 amendment states the rule, but only as to a limited class of retired personnel, namely persons temporarily appointed or promoted under the 1941 Act while on the retired list. The amendment provided that such persons, when released to inactive duty, should be given the highest grade in which they had served satisfactorily and, if subsequently recalled to active duty, should be recalled in the grade so accorded them. The legislative history shows that the bill (S. 1405, 79th Cong., 1st sess.), originally was written so as to provide that retired personnel should be recalled in their prior permanent grades or ratings instead of in the higher grades accorded them on the retired list while on inactive duty. When a member of the Naval Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives suggested an amendment to allow retired personnel to be recalled in the higher grades, the Navy spokesman pointed out that no law was required to permit this; in fact, retired personnel would be <em>required</em> to be recalled in the grades they hold on the retired list in the absence of any law to the contrary. Thus the result desired by the committee member could be achieved, simply by deleting the provision instead of amending it. After some discussion, however, it was decided to adopt the suggested amendment in order not to &ldquo;leave things to inference&rdquo; (H. Rept. No. 158, December 6, 1945, pp. 2290&ndash;2292).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 412(a) of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 (34 U.S.C. 410n) (codified, except for the first proviso, in &sect;6150 of this title), supplies a further reason why a positive statement of the rule is desirable. That section provides that an officer who has been specially commended for the performance of duty in actual combat shall, when retired, be placed on the retired list in the grade next higher than that in which serving at the time of retirement. The first proviso, codified in subsection (b) of this section, provided further that an officer advanced under &sect;412(a) to a flag or general officer grade could be recalled either in the advanced grade or in the grade from which advanced. The law was silent as to the grade in which other officers advanced under &sect;412(a) should be recalled. It was understood that they would be recalled in the advanced grade accorded them on the retired list, because there was no authority to recall them in any other grade. However, the Comptroller General raised a question as to their right to the pay of the higher grade when recalled. Although the final decision of the Comptroller General was in favor of the higher pay (30 Comp. Gen. 242, December 20, 1950), the fact that the question was raised indicates the confusion that results from leaving the rule to inference.</p>
<p class="note-body">It appears that the rule was never in doubt until after the enactment of the two recent laws cited above, one applying the rule to a limited class, and one stating a discretionary exception without stating the rule itself. These two laws make it more difficult than it was formerly to derive the correct conclusion by inference alone.</p>
