An unspecified minor military construction project is a military construction project that has an approved cost equal to or less than $1,500,000. However, if the military construction project is intended solely to correct a deficiency that is life-threatening, health-threatening, or safety-threatening, an unspecified minor military construction project may have an approved cost equal to or less than $3,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A Secretary may not use more than $5,000,000 for exercise-related unspecified minor military construction projects coordinated or directed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff outside the United States during any fiscal year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Authority provided by law to improve existing military family housing units and ancillary family housing support facilities is authority to make alterations, additions, expansions, and extensions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In this section, the term &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; includes rehabilitation of a housing unit and major maintenance or repair work to be accomplished concurrently with an improvement project. Such term does not include day-to-day maintenance and repair work.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Funds may not be expended for the improvement of any single family housing unit, or for the improvement of two or more housing units that are to be converted into or are to be used as a single family housing unit, if the cost per unit of such improvement will exceed (A) $50,000 multiplied by the area construction cost index as developed by the Department of Defense for the location concerned at the time of contract award, or (B) in the case of improvements necessary to make the unit suitable for habitation by a handicapped person, $60,000 multiplied by such index. The Secretary concerned may waive the limitations contained in the preceding sentence if (i) such Secretary determines that, considering the useful life of the structure to be improved and the useful life of a newly constructed unit and the cost of construction and of operation and maintenance of each kind of unit over its useful life, the improvement will be cost-effective, and (ii) a period of 21 days elapses after the date on which the appropriate committees of Congress receive a notice from such Secretary of the proposed waiver, together with an economic analysis demonstrating that the improvement will be cost effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the applicability of the limitation contained in paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned shall include as part of the cost of the improvement of the unit or units concerned the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The cost of major maintenance or repair work undertaken in connection with the improvement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Any cost, other than the cost of activities undertaken beyond a distance of five feet from the unit or units concerned, in connection with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the furnishing of electricity, gas, water, and sewage disposal;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The limitation contained in the first sentence of paragraph (1) does not apply to a project for the improvement of a family housing unit or units referred to in that sentence if the project (including the amount requested for the project) is identified in the budget materials submitted to Congress by the Secretary of Defense in connection with the submission to Congress of the budget for a fiscal year pursuant to section 1105 of title 31.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Secretary concerned may construct replacement military family housing units in lieu of improving existing military family housing units if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the improvement of the existing housing units has been authorized by law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary determines that the improvement project is no longer cost-effective after a review of post-design or bid cost estimates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary submits to the committees referred to in subsection (b)(1) a notice containing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) an economic analysis demonstrating that the improvement project would exceed 70 percent of the cost of constructing replacement housing units intended for members of the armed forces in the same pay grade or grades as those members who occupy the existing housing units; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if the replacement housing units are intended for members of the armed forces in a different pay grade or grades, a justification of the need for the replacement housing units based upon the long-term requirements of the armed forces in the location concerned; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a period of 21 days elapses after the date on which the Secretary submits the notice required by subparagraph (C).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount that may be expended to construct replacement military family housing units under this subsection may not exceed the amount that is otherwise available to carry out the previously authorized improvement project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) This section does not apply to projects authorized for restoration or replacement of housing units that have been damaged or destroyed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary of Defense shall encourage the use of energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy as a source of energy for military construction projects (including military family housing projects) where use of such form of energy would be practical and economically feasible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary concerned shall require that the design of all new facilities (including family housing) shall include consideration of energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy in those cases in which use of such forms of energy has the potential for reduced energy costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary concerned shall require that contracts for construction resulting from such design include a requirement that energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy be installed if such systems can be shown to be cost effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) For the purposes of this section, an energy system using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy for a facility shall be considered to be cost effective if the difference between (A) the original investment cost of the energy system for the facility with such a system, and (B) the original investment cost of the energy system for the facility without such a system can be recovered over the expected life of the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A determination under paragraph (1) concerning whether a cost-differential can be recovered over the expected life of a facility shall be made using the life-cycle cost methods and procedures established pursuant to section 544(a) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8254(a)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In order to equip a military construction project (including a military family housing project) with heating equipment, cooling equipment, or both heating and cooling equipment using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy or with a passive energy system using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy, the Secretary concerned may authorize an increase in any otherwise applicable limitation with respect to the number of square feet or the cost per square foot of the project by such amount as may be necessary for such purpose.
