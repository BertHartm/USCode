<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Authority provided by law to improve existing military family housing units and ancillary family housing support facilities is authority to make alterations, additions, expansions, and extensions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In this section, the term &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; includes rehabilitation of a housing unit and major maintenance or repair work to be accomplished concurrently with an improvement project. Such term does not include day-to-day maintenance and repair work.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Funds may not be expended for the improvement of any single family housing unit, or for the improvement of two or more housing units that are to be converted into or are to be used as a single family housing unit, if the cost per unit of such improvement will exceed (A) $50,000 multiplied by the area construction cost index as developed by the Department of Defense for the location concerned at the time of contract award, or (B) in the case of improvements necessary to make the unit suitable for habitation by a handicapped person, $60,000 multiplied by such index. The Secretary concerned may waive the limitations contained in the preceding sentence if such Secretary determines that, considering the useful life of the structure to be improved and the useful life of a newly constructed unit and the cost of construction and of operation and maintenance of each kind of unit over its useful life, the improvement will be cost-effective. If the Secretary concerned makes a determination under the preceding sentence with respect to an improvement, the waiver under that sentence with respect to that improvement may take effect only after the Secretary transmits a notice of the proposed waiver, together with an economic analysis demonstrating that the improvement will be cost effective, to the appropriate committees of Congress and a period of 21 days has elapsed after the date on which the notification is received by those committees or, if over sooner, a period of 14 days has elapsed after the date on which a copy of the notice is provided in an electronic medium pursuant to section 480 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the applicability of the limitation contained in paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned shall include as part of the cost of the improvement of the unit or units concerned the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The cost of major maintenance or repair work undertaken in connection with the improvement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) grading and drainage work.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In determining the applicability of the limitation contained in paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned shall not include as part of the cost of the improvement of the unit or units concerned the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The cost of the maintenance or repair of equipment described in subparagraph (A) installed for the purpose specified in such subparagraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The limitation contained in the first sentence of paragraph (1) does not apply to a project for the improvement of a family housing unit or units referred to in that sentence if the project (including the amount requested for the project) is identified in the budget materials submitted to Congress by the Secretary of Defense in connection with the submission to Congress of the budget for a fiscal year pursuant to section 1105 of title 31.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Secretary concerned may construct replacement military family housing units in lieu of improving existing military family housing units if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary determines that the improvement project is no longer cost-effective after a review of post-design or bid cost estimates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary submits to the committees referred to in subsection (b)(1) a notice containing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) an economic analysis demonstrating that the improvement project would exceed <!-- PDFPage:1494 -->70 percent of the cost of constructing replacement housing units intended for members of the armed forces in the same pay grade or grades as those members who occupy the existing housing units; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if the replacement housing units are intended for members of the armed forces in a different pay grade or grades, a justification of the need for the replacement housing units based upon the long-term requirements of the armed forces in the location concerned; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a period of 21 days elapses after the date on which the Secretary submits the notice required by subparagraph (C) or, if over sooner, a period of 14 days elapses after the date on which a copy of the notice is provided in an electronic medium pursuant to section 480 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount that may be expended to construct replacement military family housing units under this subsection may not exceed the amount that is otherwise available to carry out the previously authorized improvement project.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense may authorize a military installation to accept a financial incentive (including an agreement to reduce the amount of a future water bill), goods, or services generally available from a utility, for the purpose of adopting technologies and practices that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If an agreement under paragraph (3) provides for a utility to pay in advance the financing costs for the design or implementation of a program referred to in that paragraph and for such advance payment to be repayed by the United States, the cost of such advance payment may be recovered by the utility under terms that are not less favorable than the terms applicable to the most favored customer of the utility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subject to the availability of appropriations, a repayment of an advance payment under subparagraph (A) shall be made from funds available to a military department for the purchase of utility services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) An agreement under paragraph (3) shall provide that title to a water-saving device or technology installed at a military installation pursuant to the agreement shall vest in the United States.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Water cost savings realized under subsection (a)(3) shall be used as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) One-half of the amount shall be used for water conservation activities at such buildings, facilities, or installations of the Department of Defense as may be designated (in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense) by the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality that realized the water cost savings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) One-half of the amount shall be used at the installation at which the savings were realized, as determined by the commanding officer of such installation consistent with applicable law and regulations, for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) improvements to existing military family housing units;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) any unspecified minor construction project that will enhance the quality of life of personnel; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) any morale, welfare, or recreation facility or service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Defense shall include in the budget material submitted to Congress in connection with the submission of the budget for a fiscal year pursuant to section 1105 of title 31 a separate statement of the amounts available for obligation under this subsection in that fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Water Conservation Construction Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense may carry out a military construction project for water conservation, not previously authorized, using funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the Secretary for water conservation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When a decision is made to carry out a project under paragraph (1), the Secretary of Defense shall notify the appropriate committees of Congress of that decision. Such project may be carried out only after the end of the 21-day period beginning on the date the notification is received by such committees or, if earlier, the end of the 14-day period beginning on the date on which a copy of the notification is provided in an electronic medium pursuant to section 480 of this title.</p>
