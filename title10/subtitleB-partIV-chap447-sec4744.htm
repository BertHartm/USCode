<p class="note-body">Reference to the Philippine government, contained in the source statute for 10:1371, is omitted, since the Philippine Republic now has the status of a foreign country and only possessions of the United States are intended to be covered by the source statute. The words &ldquo;Armed Services Department&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;Army and Navy Department&rdquo;, in 10:1370, to reflect the present name of that Department of the Young Men's Christian Association.
