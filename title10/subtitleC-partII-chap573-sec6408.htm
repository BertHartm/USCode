<p class="note-body">This section reflects the opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy (JAG:I:2:ERS:cmr, dtd. 13 April 1954) that 50 U.S.C. 739 applies to warrant officers (now warrant officers, W&ndash;1), of the Navy and the Marine Corps. The Warrant Officer Act of 1954 established the grade of warrant officer, W&ndash;1, in lieu of the former warrant officer (as distinguished from commissioned warrant officer) grades. 50 U.S.C. 739, as applicable to officers above the grade of warrant officer, W&ndash;1, is codified in &sect;1161 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;by sentence of a general court-martial, or in commutation thereof&rdquo; are omitted since the separation from the service of a warrant officer, W&ndash;1, by sentence of court-martial is effected by dishonorable discharge.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the words &ldquo;from his place of duty&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;at least&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;or more&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;by a court other than a court-martial or other military court&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;by the civil authorities&rdquo;.</p>
