<p class="note-body">The House and Senate reports cited in the revision note on section 5891 of this title state that section 403 of the Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954 (50 U.S.C. 1303), &ldquo;by making applicable to Naval and Marine Corps Reserve officers those provisions of law *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* which relate to the selection for promotion of officers of the Regular components, would *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* provide a definition of failure of selection&rdquo;. The definition of &ldquo;failure of selection&rdquo; for regular officers and lineal-list Reserves is codified in section 5776 of this title. Differences between that section and this section are due to differences between the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 and the Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954. (1) Under the former Act, officers who are eligible for consideration for promotion include officers above the promotion zone, in the zone, and below the zone, whereas under the latter Act, the zone of eligibility and the promotion zone are identical, because no one is above the zone and no one below the zone is eligible for consideration. (2) There are no reserve officers who are restricted in the performance of duty. Therefore, this section has no counterpart for section 5776 (b). (3) In section 5776, subsection (a) covers male line officers, subsection (c) covers staff corps officers except certain officers in the Nurse Corps and women officers appointed under section 5590 of this title, and subsections (d) and (e) cover the officers excepted from subsection (c). This breakdown is not necessary in the present section. The Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954 provides for promotion zones for male line and staff corps officers of the Naval Reserve and male officers of the Marine Corps Reserve, but none for &ldquo;women officers&rdquo; or officers in the Nurse Corps Reserve. The latter two classes cannot be considered as having failed of selection, since promotion zones are essential to that concept. The others can, and the rule is the same as to all of them.  </p>
<p class="note-body">The source for subsection (b) has no counterpart in the laws relating to regular and lineal-list reserve officers.  </p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;a woman officer appointed under section 5581 of this title&rdquo; are inserted in this section as required by the act of June 24, 1952, ch. 457, 66 Stat. 155 (34 U.S.C. 21e). These officers are not &ldquo;women officers&rdquo; within the meaning of the Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954, but are required to be promoted and retired as if they were men. See the revision note on section 5665 of this title.  </p>
