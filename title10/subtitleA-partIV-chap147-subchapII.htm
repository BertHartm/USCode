<p class="statutory-body">(2) In establishing a quantity or other restriction, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may not discriminate among the various categories of eligible patrons of the commissary and exchange system; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Notification of Conditions Necessitating Restrictions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall notify Congress of any change proposed or made to any of the host nation laws or any of the treaty obligations of the United States, and any changed conditions within host nations, if the change would necessitate the use of quantity or other restrictions on purchases in commissary and exchange stores located outside the United States.</p>
