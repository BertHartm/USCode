Pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and under such regulations as the Secretary of Defense may prescribe, the Secretary of Defense may waive the operation of this paragraph in connection with clinical trials sponsored or approved by the National Institutes of Health if the Secretary of Defense determines that such a waiver will promote access by covered beneficiaries to promising new treatments and contribute to the development of such treatments.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Plans covered by subsection (a) shall include provisions for payment by the patient of the following amounts:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) $25 for each admission to a hospital, or the amount the patient would have been charged under section 1078(a) of this title had the care being paid for been obtained in a hospital of the uniformed services, whichever amount is the greater. The Secretary of Defense may exempt a patient from paying such amount if the hospital to which the patient is <!-- PDFPage:432 -->admitted does not impose a legal obligation on any of its patients to pay for inpatient care.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Except as provided in clause (3), the first $150 each fiscal year of the charges for all types of care authorized by subsection (a) and received while in an outpatient status and 20 percent of all subsequent charges for such care during a fiscal year. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the case of a dependent of an enlisted member in a pay grade below E&ndash;5, the initial deductible each fiscal year under this paragraph shall be limited to $50.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A family group of two or more persons covered by this section shall not be required to pay collectively more than the first $300 (or in the case of the family group of an enlisted member in a pay grade below E&ndash;5, the first $100) each fiscal year of the charges for all types of care authorized by subsection (a) and received while in an outpatient status and 20 percent of the additional charges for such care during a fiscal year.</p>

Any care for which payment is made under this clause shall not be considered to be care received while in an outpatient status for purposes of clauses (2) and (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) An individual or family group of two or more persons covered by this section may not be required by reason of this subsection to pay a total of more than $1,000 for health care received during any fiscal year under a plan under subsection (a).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Under joint regulations to be prescribed by the administering Secretaries, in the case of a dependent, as described in subparagraph (A), (D), or (I) of section 1072(2) of this title, of a member of the uniformed services on active duty for a period of more than 30 days, who is moderately or severely mentally retarded or who has a serious physical handicap, the plans covered by subsection (a) shall, with respect to the retardation or handicap of such dependent, include the following:</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Members shall be required to share in the cost of any benefits provided their dependents under subsection (d) as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Except as provided in clause (3), members in the lowest enlisted pay grade shall be required to pay the first $25 incurred each month and members in the highest commissioned pay grade shall similarly be required to pay $250 per month. The amounts to be similarly paid by members in all other pay grades shall be determined under joint regulations to be prescribed by the administering Secretaries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Except as provided in clause (4), the Government's share of the cost of any benefits provided in a particular case under subsection (d) shall not exceed $1,000 per month.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Members shall also be required to pay each month that amount, if any, remaining after the Government's maximum share has been reached.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) A member who has more than one dependent incurring expenses in a given month under a plan covered by subsection (d) shall not be required to pay an amount greater than he would be required to pay if he had but one such dependent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) To qualify for the benefits provided by subsection (d), members shall be required to use public facilities to the extent they are available and adequate as determined under joint regulations of the administering Secretaries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) When a member dies while he is eligible for receipt of hostile fire pay under section 310 of title 37 or from a disease or injury incurred while eligible for such pay, his dependents who are receiving benefits under a plan covered by subsection (d) shall continue to be eligible for such benefits until they pass their twenty-first birthday. In addition, when a member dies while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days, the member's dependents who are receiving benefits under a plan covered by subsection (a) shall continue to be eligible for such benefits during the one-year period beginning on the date of the death of the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), payment for a charge for services by an individual health care professional (or other noninstitutional health care provider) for which a claim is submitted under a plan contracted for under subsection (a) shall be equal to an amount determined to be appropriate, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the same reimbursement rules as apply to payments for similar services under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.). The Secretary of Defense shall determine the appropriate payment amount under this paragraph in consultation with the other administering Secretaries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, shall prescribe regulations to provide for such exceptions to the payment limitations under paragraph (1) as the Secretary determines to be necessary to assure that covered beneficiaries retain adequate access to health care services. Such exceptions may include the payment of amounts higher than the amount allowed under paragraph (1) when enrollees in managed care programs obtain covered services from nonparticipating providers. To provide a suitable transition from the payment methodologies in effect before the date of the enactment of this paragraph to the methodology required by paragraph (1), the amount allowable for any service may not be reduced by more than 15 percent below the amount allowed for the same service during the immediately preceding 12-month period (or other period as established by the Secretary of Defense).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:433 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) In addition to the authority provided under paragraph (2), the Secretary of Defense may authorize the commander of a facility of the uniformed services, the lead agent (if other than the commander), and the health care contractor to modify the payment limitations under paragraph (1) for certain health care providers when necessary to ensure both the availability of certain services for covered beneficiaries and lower costs than would otherwise be incurred to provide the services. With the consent of the health care provider, the Secretary is also authorized to reduce the authorized payment for certain health care services below the amount otherwise required by the payment limitations under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, shall prescribe regulations to establish limitations (similar to the limitations established under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.)) on beneficiary liability for charges of an individual health care professional (or other noninstitutional health care provider).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) The limitation in subsection (a)(6) does not apply in the case of inpatient mental health services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provided under the program for the handicapped under subsection (d);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provided as partial hospital care; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provided pursuant to a waiver authorized by the Secretary of Defense because of medical or psychological circumstances of the patient that are confirmed by a health professional who is not a Federal employee after a review, pursuant to rules prescribed by the Secretary, which takes into account the appropriate level of care for the patient, the intensity of services required by the patient, and the availability of that care.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding subsection (b) or section 1086(b) of this title, the Secretary of Defense (after consulting with the other administering Secretaries) may prescribe separate payment requirements (including deductibles, copayments, and catastrophic limits) for the provision of mental health services to persons covered by this section or section 1086 of this title. The payment requirements may vary for different categories of covered beneficiaries, by type of mental health service provided, and based on the location of the covered beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except in the case of an emergency, the Secretary of Defense shall require preadmission authorization before inpatient mental health services may be provided to persons covered by this section or section 1086 of this title. In the case of the provision of emergency inpatient mental health services, approval for the continuation of such services shall be required within 72 hours after admission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j)(1) A benefit may not be paid under a plan covered by this section in the case of a person enrolled in, or covered by, any other insurance, medical service, or health plan, including any plan offered by a third-party payer (as defined in section 1095(h)(1) of this title), to the extent that the benefit is also a benefit under the other plan, except in the case of a plan administered under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The amount to be paid to a provider of services for services provided under a plan covered by this section may be determined under joint regulations to be prescribed by the administering Secretaries which provide that the amount of such payments shall be determined to the extent practicable in accordance with the same reimbursement rules as apply to payments to providers of services of the same type under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;provider of services&rdquo; means a hospital, skilled nursing facility, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility, home health agency, hospice program (as defined in section 1861(dd)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(dd)(2))), or other institutional facility providing services for which payment may be made under a plan covered by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) A plan covered by this section may include provision of liver transplants (including the cost of acquisition and transportation of the donated liver) in accordance with this subsection. Such a liver transplant may be provided if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the transplant is for a dependent considered appropriate for that procedure by the Secretary of Defense in consultation with the other administering Secretaries and such other entities as the Secretary considers appropriate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the transplant is to be carried out at a health-care facility that has been approved for that purpose by the Secretary of Defense after consultation with the other administering Secretaries and such other entities as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>)(1) Contracts entered into under subsection (a) shall also provide for medical care for dependents of former members of the uniformed services who are authorized to receive medical and dental care under section 1076(e) of this title in facilities of the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), medical care in the case of a dependent described in section 1076(e) shall be furnished under the same conditions and subject to the same limitations as medical care furnished under this section to spouses and children of members of the uniformed services described in the first sentence of subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Medical care may be furnished to a dependent pursuant to paragraph (1) only for an injury, illness, or other condition described in section 1076(e) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary of Defense may, upon request, make payments under this section for a charge for services for which a claim is submitted under a plan contracted for under subsection (a) to a hospital that does not impose a legal obligation on any of its patients to pay for such services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A payment under paragraph (1) may not exceed the average amount paid for comparable services in the geographic area in which the hospital is located or, if no comparable services are available in that area, in an area similar to the area in which the hospital is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Defense shall periodically review the billing practices of each hospital the Secretary approves for payment under this sub<!-- PDFPage:434 -->section to ensure that the hospital's practices of not billing patients for payment are not resulting in increased costs to the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of Defense may require each hospital the Secretary approves for payment under this subsection to provide evidence that it has sources of revenue to cover unbilled costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(n) The Secretary of Defense may enter into contracts (or amend existing contracts) with fiscal intermediaries under which the intermediaries agree to organize and operate, directly or through subcontractors, managed health care networks for the provision of health care under this chapter. The managed health care networks shall include cost containment methods, such as utilization review and contracting for care on a discounted basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>o</em>)(1) Health care services provided pursuant to this section or section 1086 of this title (or pursuant to any other contract or project under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services) may not include services determined under the CHAMPUS Peer Review Organization program to be not medically or psychologically necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense, after consulting with the other administering Secretaries, may adopt or adapt for use under the CHAMPUS Peer Review Organization program, as the Secretary considers appropriate, any of the quality and utilization review requirements and procedures that are used by the Peer Review Organization program under part B of title XI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320c et seq.).</p>
