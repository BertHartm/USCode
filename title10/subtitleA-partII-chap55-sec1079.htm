<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), payment for a charge for services by an individual health care professional (or other non<!-- PDFPage:662 -->institutional health care provider) for which a claim is submitted under a plan contracted for under subsection (a) shall be equal to an amount determined to be appropriate, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the same reimbursement rules as apply to payments for similar services under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.). The Secretary of Defense shall determine the appropriate payment amount under this paragraph in consultation with the other administering Secretaries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, shall prescribe regulations to provide for such exceptions to the payment limitations under paragraph (1) as the Secretary determines to be necessary to assure that covered beneficiaries retain adequate access to health care services. Such exceptions may include the payment of amounts higher than the amount allowed under paragraph (1) when enrollees in managed care programs obtain covered services from nonparticipating providers. To provide a suitable transition from the payment methodologies in effect before February 10, 1996, to the methodology required by paragraph (1), the amount allowable for any service may not be reduced by more than 15 percent below the amount allowed for the same service during the immediately preceding 12-month period (or other period as established by the Secretary of Defense).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In addition to the authority provided under paragraph (2), the Secretary of Defense may authorize the commander of a facility of the uniformed services, the lead agent (if other than the commander), and the health care contractor to modify the payment limitations under paragraph (1) for certain health care providers when necessary to ensure both the availability of certain services for covered beneficiaries and lower costs than would otherwise be incurred to provide the services. With the consent of the health care provider, the Secretary is also authorized to reduce the authorized payment for certain health care services below the amount otherwise required by the payment limitations under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, shall prescribe regulations to establish limitations (similar to the limitations established under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.)) on beneficiary liability for charges of an individual health care professional (or other noninstitutional health care provider).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The regulations shall include a restriction that prohibits an individual health care professional (or other noninstitutional health care provider) from billing a beneficiary for services for more than the amount that is equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the excess of the limiting charge (as defined in section 1848(g)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w&ndash;4(g)(2))) that would be applicable if the services had been provided by the professional (or other provider) as an individual health care professional (or other noninstitutional health care provider) on a nonassignment-related basis under part B of title XVIII of such Act over the amount that is payable by the United States for those services under this subsection, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any unpaid amounts of deductibles or copayments that are payable directly to the professional (or other provider) by the beneficiary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) In the case of a dependent described in clause (ii), the regulations shall provide that, in addition to amounts otherwise payable by the United States, the Secretary may pay the amount referred to in subparagraph (B)(i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) This subparagraph applies to a dependent referred to in subsection (a) of a member of a reserve component serving on active duty pursuant to a call or order to active duty for a period of more than 30 days in support of a contingency operation under a provision of law referred to in section 101(a)(13)(B) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) To assure access to care for all covered beneficiaries, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, shall designate specific rates for reimbursement for services in certain localities if the Secretary determines that without payment of such rates access to health care services would be severely impaired. Such a determination shall be based on consideration of the number of providers in a locality who provide the services, the number of such providers who are CHAMPUS participating providers, the number of covered beneficiaries under CHAMPUS in the locality, the availability of military providers in the location or a nearby location, and any other factors determined to be relevant by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) The limitation in subsection (a)(6) does not apply in the case of inpatient mental health services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provided under the program for the handicapped under subsection (d);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provided as partial hospital care; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provided pursuant to a waiver authorized by the Secretary of Defense because of medical or psychological circumstances of the patient that are confirmed by a health professional who is not a Federal employee after a review, pursuant to rules prescribed by the Secretary, which takes into account the appropriate level of care for the patient, the intensity of services required by the patient, and the availability of that care.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding subsection (b) or section 1086(b) of this title, the Secretary of Defense (after consulting with the other administering Secretaries) may prescribe separate payment requirements (including deductibles, copayments, and catastrophic limits) for the provision of mental health services to persons covered by this section or section 1086 of this title. The payment requirements may vary for different categories of covered beneficiaries, by type of mental health service provided, and based on the location of the covered beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Secretary of Defense shall require preadmission authorization before inpatient mental health services may be provided to persons covered by this section or section 1086 of this title.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount to be paid to a provider of services for services provided under a plan covered by this section shall be determined under joint regulations to be prescribed by the administering Secretaries which provide that the amount of such payments shall be determined to the extent practicable in accordance with the same reimbursement rules as apply to payments to providers of services of the same type under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A contract for a plan covered by this section shall include a clause that prohibits each provider of services under the plan from billing any person covered by the plan for any balance of charges for services in excess of the amount paid for those services under the joint regulations referred to in paragraph (2), except for any unpaid amounts of deductibles or copayments that are payable directly to the provider by the person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(k) A plan covered by this section may include provision of liver transplants (including the cost of acquisition and transportation of the donated liver) in accordance with this subsection. Such a liver transplant may be provided if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the transplant is for a dependent considered appropriate for that procedure by the Secretary of Defense in consultation with the other administering Secretaries and such other entities as the Secretary considers appropriate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the transplant is to be carried out at a health-care facility that has been approved for that purpose by the Secretary of Defense after consultation with the other administering Secretaries and such other entities as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>)(1) Contracts entered into under subsection (a) shall also provide for medical care for dependents of former members of the uniformed services who are authorized to receive medical and dental care under section 1076(e) of this title in facilities of the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), medical care in the case of a dependent described in section 1076(e) shall be furnished under the same conditions and subject to the same limitations as medical care furnished under this section to spouses and children of members of the uniformed services described in the first sentence of subsection (a).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A payment under paragraph (1) may not exceed the average amount paid for comparable services in the geographic area in which the hospital is located or, if no comparable services are available in that area, in an area similar to the area in which the hospital is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Defense shall periodically review the billing practices of each hospital the Secretary approves for payment under this subsection to ensure that the hospital's practices of not billing patients for payment are not resulting in increased costs to the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of Defense may require each hospital the Secretary approves for payment under this subsection to provide evidence that it has sources of revenue to cover unbilled costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(n) The Secretary of Defense may enter into contracts (or amend existing contracts) with fiscal intermediaries under which the intermediaries agree to organize and operate, directly or through subcontractors, managed health care networks for the provision of health care under this chapter.
