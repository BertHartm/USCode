<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The closure and realignment of military installations within the United States is a necessary consequence of the end of the Cold War and of changed United States national security requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) A military installation is a significant source of employment for many communities, and the closure or realignment of an installation may cause economic hardship for such communities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) It is in the interest of the United States that the Federal Government facilitate the economic recovery of communities that experience adverse economic circumstances as a result of the closure or realignment of a military installation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) It is in the interest of the United States that the Federal Government assist communities that experience adverse economic circumstances as a result of the closure of military installations by working with such communities to identify and implement means of reutilizing or redeveloping such installations in a beneficial manner or of otherwise revitalizing such communities and the economies of such communities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The Federal Government may best identify and implement such means by requiring that the head of each department or agency of the Federal Government having jurisdiction over a matter arising out of the closure of a military installation under a base closure law, or the reutilization and redevelopment of such an installation, designate for each installation to be closed an individual in such department or agency who shall provide information and assistance to the transition coordinator for the installation designated under section 2915 [set out below] on the assistance, programs, or other activities of such department or agency with respect to the closure or reutilization and redevelopment of the installation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The Federal Government may also provide such assistance by accelerating environmental restoration at military installations to be closed, and by closing such installations, in a manner that best ensures the beneficial reutilization and redevelopment of such installations by such communities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The Federal Government may best contribute to such reutilization and redevelopment by making available real and personal property at military installations to be closed to communities affected by such closures on a timely basis, and, if appropriate, at less than fair market value.&rdquo;</p>
