<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under the program of a military department, the Secretary of that military department shall allocate a portion of the total number of scholarships to members of the program described in paragraph (1)(B) for the purpose of assisting such members to pursue a degree at the masters and doctoral level in any of the following disciplines:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Other disciplines that contribute to mental health care programs in that military department.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The program shall consist of courses of study and specialized training in designated health professions, with obligatory periods of military training.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Persons participating in the program shall be commissioned officers in reserve components of the armed forces. Members pursuing a course of study shall serve on active duty in pay grade O&ndash;1 with full pay and allowances of that grade for a period of 45 days during each year of participation in the program.
