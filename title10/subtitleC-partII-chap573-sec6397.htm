<p class="note-body">The act of August 9, 1955, ch. 654, section 1 (69 Stat. 579) authorized the appointment of men as commissioned officers in the Nurse Corps of the Naval Reserve. Even though it is assumed that men will be a small minority in the Corps, the masculine pronoun is used throughout since under 1 U.S.C. 1 words importing the masculine gender include the feminine. The converse is not true.</p>
