So long as any such war or national emergency continues, any such suspension may be extended by the President.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Any suspension under subsection (a) shall, if not sooner ended, end on the last day of the two-year period beginning on the date on which the suspension (or the last extension thereof) takes effect or on the last day of the one-year period beginning on the date of the termination of the war or national emergency, whichever occurs first. With respect to the end of any such suspension, the preceding sentence supersedes the provisions of title II of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1621, 1622) which provide that powers or authorities exercised by reason of a national emergency shall cease to be exercised after the date of termination of the emergency.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;12207. Commissioned officers: service credit upon original appointment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) For the purpose of determining the grade and the rank within grade of a person receiving an original appointment as a reserve commissioned officer (other than a commissioned warrant officer) in the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps, the person shall be credited at the time of the appointment with any commissioned service (other than service as a commissioned warrant officer) performed before such appointment as a regular officer, or as a reserve officer in an active status, in any armed force, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or the Public Health Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations, which shall apply uniformly among the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, to authorize the Secretary of the military department concerned to limit the amount of prior commissioned service with which a person receiving an original appointment may be credited under paragraph (1), or to deny any such credit, in the case of a person who at the time of such appointment is credited with constructive service under subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, a person who is receiving an original appointment as a reserve commissioned officer (other than a commissioned warrant officer) of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps, or a designation in, or an assignment to, an officer category in which advanced education or training is required and who has advanced education or training, shall be credited with constructive service for such education, training, or experience, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) One year for each year of advanced education beyond the baccalaureate degree level, for persons appointed or designated in, or assigned to, officer categories requiring such advanced education or an advanced degree as a prerequisite for such appointment, designation, or assignment. In determining the number of years of constructive service to be credited under this subparagraph to officers in any professional field, the Secretary concerned shall credit an officer with, but with not more than, the number of years of advanced education required by a majority of institutions <!-- PDFPage:2061 -->that award degrees in that professional field for completion of the advanced education or award of the advanced degree.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) Credit for any period of advanced education in a health profession (other than medicine and dentistry) beyond the baccalaureate degree level which exceeds the basic education criteria for such appointment, designation, or assignment, if such advanced education will be directly used by the armed force concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Credit for experience in a health profession (other than medicine or dentistry), if such experience will be directly used by the armed force concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Additional credit of (i) not more than one year for internship or equivalent graduate medical, dental, or other formal health professional training required by the armed forces, and (ii) not more than one year for each additional year of such graduate-level training or experience creditable toward certification in a speciality required by the armed force concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Additional credit, in unusual cases, based on special experience in a particular field.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Additional credit for experience as a physician or dentist, if appointed, assigned, or designated as a medical or dental officer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary of Defense determines that the number of medical or dental officers serving in an active status in a reserve component of the Army, Navy, or Air Force in grades below major or lieutenant commander is critically below the number needed by such reserve component in such grades, the Secretary of Defense may authorize the Secretary of the military department concerned to credit any person who is receiving an original appointment for service as a medical or dental officer with a period of constructive credit in such amount (in addition to any amount credited such person under subsection (b)) as will result in the grade of such person being that of captain or, in the case of the Navy Reserve, lieutenant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except as authorized by the Secretary concerned in individual cases and under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense in the case of a medical or dental officer, the amount of constructive service credited an officer under this subsection may not exceed the amount required in order for the officer to be eligible for an original appointment as a reserve officer of the Army, Air Force, or Marine Corps in the grade of major or as a reserve officer of the Navy in the grade of lieutenant commander.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Constructive service credited an officer under this subsection is in addition to any service credited that officer under subsection (a) and shall be credited at the time of the original appointment of the officer or assignment to or designation in an officer category in which advanced education or training or special experience is required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Constructive service may not be credited under subsection (b) for education, training, or experience obtained while serving as a commissioned officer (other than a warrant officer) on active duty or in an active status. However, in the case of an officer who completes advanced education or receives an advanced degree while on active duty or in an active status and in less than the number of years normally required to complete such advanced education or receive such advanced degree, constructive service may, subject to regulations prescribed under subsection (a)(2), be credited to the officer under subsection (b)(1)(A) to the extent that the number of years normally required to complete such advanced education or receive such advanced degree exceeds the actual number of years in which such advanced education or degree is obtained by the officer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If the Secretary of Defense determines that the number of qualified judge advocates serving on the active-duty list of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps in grades below lieutenant commander or major is critically below the number needed by that armed force in those grades, the Secretary of Defense may authorize the Secretary of the military department concerned to credit any person who is receiving an original appointment with a view to assignment to the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the Army or appointment to the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the Navy, or who is receiving an original appointment in the Air Force or Marine Corps with a view to designation as a judge advocate, with a period of constructive service in such an amount (in addition to any amount credited such person under subsection (b)) as will result in the grade of such person being that of captain or, in the case of the Navy, lieutenant, and the date of rank of such person being junior to that of all other officers of the same grade serving on the active-duty list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Constructive service credited an officer under subsection (b) or (d) shall be used only for determining the officer's&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) initial grade as a reserve officer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) rank in grade; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) service in grade for promotion eligibility.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In time of war or of national emergency declared by Congress, or when otherwise authorized by law, an authority designated by the Secretary concerned may, without the consent of the persons affected, order any unit, and any member not assigned to a unit organized to serve as a unit, of a reserve component under the jurisdiction of that Secretary to active duty for the duration of the war or emergency and for six months thereafter. However a member on an inactive status list or in a retired status may not be ordered to active duty under this subsection unless the Secretary concerned, with the approval of the Secretary of Defense in the case of the Secretary of a military department, determines that there are not enough qualified Reserves in an active status or in the inactive National Guard in the required category who are readily available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) At any time, an authority designated by the Secretary concerned may, without the consent of the persons affected, order any unit, and any member not assigned to a unit organized to serve as a unit, in an active status in a reserve component under the jurisdiction of that Secretary to active duty for not more than 15 days a year. However, units and members of the Army National Guard of the United States or the Air National Guard of the United States may not be ordered to active duty under this subsection without the consent of the governor of the State (or, in the case of the District of Columbia National Guard, the commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) So far as practicable, during any expansion of the active armed forces that requires that units and members of the reserve components be ordered to active duty as provided in subsection (a), members of units organized and trained to serve as units who are ordered to that duty without their consent shall be so ordered with their units. However, members of those units may be reassigned after being so ordered to active duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) At any time, an authority designated by the Secretary concerned may order a member of <!-- PDFPage:2068 -->a reserve component under his jurisdiction to active duty, or retain him on active duty, with the consent of that member. However, a member of the Army National Guard of the United States or the Air National Guard of the United States may not be ordered to active duty under this subsection without the consent of the governor or other appropriate authority of the State concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The period of time allowed between the date when a Reserve ordered to active duty as provided in subsection (a) is alerted for that duty and the date when the Reserve is required to enter upon that duty shall be determined by the Secretary concerned based upon military requirements at that time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The consent of a Governor described in subsections (b) and (d) may not be withheld (in whole or in part) with regard to active duty outside the United States, its territories, and its possessions, because of any objection to the location, purpose, type, or schedule of such active duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) A member of a reserve component may be ordered to active duty without his consent if the Secretary concerned determines that the member is in a captive status. A member ordered to active duty under this section may not be retained on active duty, without his consent, for more than 30 days after his captive status is terminated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section. Such regulations shall apply uniformly among the armed forces under the jurisdiction of the Secretary. A determination for the purposes of this subsection that a member is in a captive status shall be made pursuant to such regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In this section, the term &ldquo;captive status&rdquo; means the status of a member of the armed forces who is in a missing status (as defined in section 551(2) of title 37) which occurs as the result of a hostile action and is related to the member's military status.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) When authorized by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of a military department may, with the consent of the member, order a member of a reserve component to active duty&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to receive authorized medical care;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to be medically evaluated for disability or other purposes; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to complete a required Department of Defense health care study, which may include an associated medical evaluation of the member.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A member ordered to active duty under this subsection may, with the member's consent, be retained on active duty, if the Secretary concerned considers it appropriate, for medical treatment for a condition associated with the study or evaluation, if that treatment of the member is otherwise authorized by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A member of the Army National Guard of the United States or the Air National Guard of the United States may be ordered to active duty under this subsection only with the consent of the Governor or other appropriate authority of the State concerned.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1962 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">The change is made to conform section 674(a) more closely to the source law for that section, section 206(a) of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 (66 Stat. 483). Section 206(a) of that Act defined the Standby Reserve in terms of units and members of the reserve components according to their liability to be ordered to active duty. It did not provide authority to order units and members of the Standby Reserve to active duty. This authority was provided by section 233(a) of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 (66 Stat. 489), which is restated in section 672(a) of title 10. Since the present language of section 674(a) may be interpreted to provide independent authority to order units and members of the Standby Reserve to active duty, it is revised to make clear that this is not the case and that section 672 is the authority for that action.</p>

The Board shall conduct the first valuation and determine a premium rate methodology not later than six months after the insurance program is established.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Effects of Changed Benefits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If at the time of any actuarial valuation under subsection (b) there has been a change in benefits under the insurance program that has been made since the last such valuation and such change in benefits increases or decreases the present value of amounts payable from the Fund, the Board of Actuaries shall determine a premium rate methodology, and recommend to the Secretary a premium schedule, for the liq<!-- PDFPage:2090 -->uidation of any liability (or actuarial gain to the Fund) resulting from such change and any previous such changes so that the present value of the sum of the scheduled premium payments (or reduction in payments that would otherwise be made) equals the cumulative increase (or decrease) in the present value of such benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Actuarial Gains or Losses</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If at the time of any such valuation the Board of Actuaries determines that there has been an actuarial gain or loss to the Fund as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions since the last valuation or as a result of any differences, between actual and expected experience since the last valuation, the Board shall recommend to the Secretary a premium rate schedule for the amortization of the cumulative gain or loss to the Fund resulting from such changes in assumptions and any previous such changes in assumptions or from the differences in actual and expected experience, respectively, through an increase or decrease in the payments that would otherwise be made to the Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Insufficient Assets</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If at any time liabilities of the Fund exceed assets of the Fund as a result of members of the Ready Reserve being ordered to active duty as described in section 12521(2) of this title, and funds are unavailable to pay benefits completely, the Secretary shall request the President to submit to Congress a request for a special appropriation to cover the unfunded liability. If appropriations are not made to cover an unfunded liability in any fiscal year, the Secretary shall reduce the amount of the benefits paid under the insurance program to a total amount that does not exceed the assets of the Fund expected to accrue by the end of such fiscal year. Benefits that cannot be paid because of such a reduction shall be deferred and may be paid only after and to the extent that additional funds become available.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;is entitled&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;shall *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* be granted&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;in the status of a commissioned officer, warrant officer, flight officer, or enlisted person&rdquo; and the references to reserve components are omitted as surplusage. Reference to the Army and the Air Force without component is inserted, since the words &ldquo;reserve component&rdquo;, as used in 10:1036a(a), include all members of the Army and the Air Force except members of the regular components thereof. The words &ldquo;service, computed under section 1332 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;satisfactory Federal service&rdquo; to make it clear that some service that is not normally covered by the latter term may be counted in determining rights to retired pay under this chapter. Section 311 of the source statute, which made title III of that act applicable to the Coast Guard, was expressly repealed by the Act of August 4, 1949, ch. 393, &sect;20, 63 Stat. 565, the act which codified Title 14 of the United States Code. 14 U.S.C. 755(e) provides for Coast Guard Reservists the same retirement benefits as those prescribed by law for the Naval Reserve, and, for this purpose, confers upon the Secretary of the Treasury the same authority as that conferred upon the Secretary of the Navy, when the Coast Guard is operating under the Treasury Department. Accordingly, the revised chapter is made expressly applicable to the Coast Guard.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;the Army without component or other category covered by section 1332(a)(1) of this title&rdquo; are inserted, since the words &ldquo;reserve component&rdquo;, as used in 10:1036a(a), also cover members without component and members of the other special categories listed. The words &ldquo;annual training duty, or attendance at a school designated as a service school by law or by the Secretary of the appropriate military department&rdquo; are inserted since the words &ldquo;active Federal service&rdquo;, as used in 10:1036a(a), also cover the additional service listed. The words &ldquo;active duty&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;active Federal service&rdquo; for uniformity.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1958 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">The change makes clear that in the determination of eligibility for retired pay for non&ndash;regular service, the service of a Regular serving in a temporary grade (that is, without component) may not be counted.

<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) consolidates the provisions of 10:1036a and 1036e(b)&ndash;(d), and 34:440i and 440m(b)&ndash;(d), relating to service that may be counted in determining eligibility for retired pay under this chapter. 10:1036e(a) and 34:440m(a) are omitted as covered by the enumeration of the service that may be counted for the purposes of the revised section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1)(A)&ndash;(F), the requirement that the service must have been satisfactory is omitted as executed, since all service before July 1, 1949, has been found to have been satisfactory by the Secretaries concerned.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1)(A), the words &ldquo;the armed forces&rdquo; are substituted for clauses (1), (2), (5)&ndash;(7), (9), (10), and (13)&ndash;(16), of 10:1036e(c) and 34:440m(c), and so much of clause (8) of 10:1036e(c) and 34:440m(c) as relates to the Naval Reserve and the Naval Reserve Force as constituted after February 28, 1925, since the service covered by those clauses when added to service in the regular components, comprises all service in the armed forces.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1)(B)&ndash;(C), the words &ldquo;June 15&rdquo; are inserted to reflect the exact date of the change in National Guard status made by section 5 of the Act of June 15, 1933, ch. 87, 48 Stat. 155, which established the National Guard of the United States as a reserve component of the Army.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1)(D), 10:1036e(c)(8) (last 25 words), 10:1036e(c)(9) (last 22 words), 34:440m(c)(8) (last 25 words), and 34:440m(c)(9) (last 22 words) are omitted as covered by subsection (b)(5).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2)(A), the words &ldquo;service that conformed to required standards and qualifications&rdquo; are substituted for 10:1036e(b) and 34:440m(b). In clause (a)(2)(A), 10:1036e(d) and 34:440m(d), which make it clear that &ldquo;active Federal service&rdquo;, in the sense in which that term is used in 10:1036a&ndash;e and 34:440i&ndash;m, includes annual training duty and attendance at service schools, are omitted as covered by sections 101(22) and 101(24) of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2)(A) and (B), specific reference is made to National Guard service to reflect the opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA, 1956/1908, 13 Feb. 1956).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2)(C), the words &ldquo;other than active Federal service&rdquo; are omitted, since the points for membership are not reduced by active duty (see opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA, 1953/2016, 3 Mar. 1953)).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (a) and (b), the words &ldquo;active service&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;active Federal service&rdquo; for uniformity of expression. In clause (5), the words &ldquo;transferred thereto after completion of 16 or more years of active naval service&rdquo; are omitted, since other authorized fleet reserve categories have not been used <!-- PDFPage:2107 -->and authority for them is omitted from this revised title as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b)(1)&ndash;(4) is inserted because of 10:1036e(e) and (f) and 34:440m(e) and (f), which state that the service enumerated in those clauses may not be considered in determining eligibility for retired pay under this chapter. Clause (5) is based on the exclusions in 34:440m(c)(8)&ndash;(9).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b)(6) is inserted for clarity since 10:1036a and 34:440i were limited in applicability to service in the status of a &ldquo;commissioned officer, warrant officer, flight officer, or enlisted person.&rdquo;</p>
