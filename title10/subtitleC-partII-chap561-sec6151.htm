<p class="note-body">Subsections (b) and (c) are worded to conform to the terminology of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.). The second and third provisos in 34 U.S.C. 410c(a), relating to the computation of retired pay for officers whose pay on the active list was not based on years of service, are omitted as obsolete, since under the Career Compensation Act of 1949, the active-duty pay of all officers is based on years of service.</p>
