<p class="note-body">So much of 34 U.S.C. 901a as authorizes a commuted ration for enlisted members of the naval service under conditions and at rates prescribed by the Secretary of the Navy is superseded by &sect;301 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 251). That section established a basic allowance for subsistence for enlisted members entitled to basic pay who are not subsisting at Government expense and prescribes the conditions under which the basic allowance for subsistence shall be paid and the amount of the allowance. Pursuant to Executive Order No. 10119, March 30, 1950, 15 F.R. 1757, the Secretary of Defense is authorized to make supplemental regulations to carry out the provisions of &sect;301. The words &ldquo;or to a per diem in place of subsistence&rdquo; are inserted to reflect the subsistence allowance authorized by &sect;303(a) of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 253a) to members in travel status.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) reference to the Coast and Geodetic Survey is omitted since there are no enlisted personnel in that service, and reference to the Coast Guard is omitted as covered by 14 U.S.C. 478.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (a) and (b) the words &ldquo;or furlough therefrom&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage, and the words &ldquo;for each day&rdquo; are inserted to make clear the fact that a ration is a daily allowance of food and that, in subsection (b), the commuted ration is credited on a daily basis. The words &ldquo;and cadets&rdquo; are omitted as there are no cadets in the Navy or Marine Corps entitled to a Navy ration. Aviation cadets are entitled to the basic allowance for subsistence prescribed for officers (34 U.S.C. 850c).</p>
