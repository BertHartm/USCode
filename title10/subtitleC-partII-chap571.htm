<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) An officer of the Navy or the Marine Corps who applies for retirement after completing more than 20 years of active service, of which at least 10 years was service as a commissioned officer, may, in the discretion of the President, be retired on the first day of any month designated by the President.</p>

<p class="note-body">The Act of April 14, 1949 (34 U.S.C. 410b&ndash;1), extending the benefits of 34 U.S.C. 410b to officers on the honorary retired lists, was enacted because the Comptroller General had held that these officers, being already in a retired status, could not be retired under 34 U.S.C. 410b (U.S. Code Congressional Service, 1949, p. 1179). The provisions of the Naval Reserve Act of 1938 relating to the honorary retired lists were repealed by &sect;803 of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952, but insofar as they provided for retirement and retired pay they were reenacted, for a period of 20 years, in &sect;413 of that act (50 U.S.C. 1052). Persons on the honorary retired lists when the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 was passed were transferred to the appropriate Retired Reserve under &sect;213 of the Act. Persons qualifying for retirement under &sect;413 are likewise placed in the Retired Reserve. The purpose of Congress in enacting &sect;413 was to preserve the accrued rights of persons who were members of reserve components on January 1, 1953, the effective date of the Act (U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News, 1952, p. 3584). One of their rights was the right to apply for retirement under 34 U.S.C. 410b upon completion of the required service, notwithstanding the fact that, before qualifying for retirement under that section, they had already acquired a retired status. Subsection (c) is worded accordingly.</p>

<p class="note-body">Title III of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 authorizes temporary promotions to the grades of lieutenant through rear admiral. The purpose of &sect;316(j) of that act (34 U.S.C. 410m) was to insure that each officer who is temporarily promoted under that Title, and who retires before he receives a permanent appointment in the grade in which he is serving, will be considered, for the purposes of the laws relating to retired grade and pay, to be serving in the grade he holds pursuant to his temporary appointment. Since &sect;5001 of this title provides that an officer who holds a permanent appointment in one grade and a temporary appointment in a higher grade is considered as serving in the higher grade, a restatement of the substance of &sect;316(j) is unnecessary and is omitted from subsection (a). The words &ldquo;retired other than by reason of physical disability incurred in line of duty&rdquo;, in 34 U.S.C. 43g(d) and (f) and 34 U.S.C. 410r(g), are omitted as unnecessary, since this section relates only to officers who are voluntarily retired under this chapter. The words &ldquo;basic pay to which he would be entitled if serving on active duty in the grade in which retired&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;active-duty pay with longevity credit of the rank with which retired&rdquo; in 34 U.S.C. 410c(a), for the words &ldquo;active-duty pay to which entitled at the time of retirement&rdquo; in 34 U.S.C. 43g(d), and for the words &ldquo;active-duty pay to which she would be entitled if serving, at the time of retirement, on active duty in the rank in which placed upon the retired list&rdquo; in 34 U.S.C. 43g(f) and 34 U.S.C. 410r(g), to make clear the fact that the amount of retired pay is not permanently fixed at the time of retirement but is subject to change when rates of basic pay are changed, as provided in 34 U.S.C. 410q. The words &ldquo;basic pay&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;active-duty pay&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;creditable for basic pay&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;for which entitled to credit in the computation of her active-duty pay&rdquo;, and for the words &ldquo;for which entitled to credit in the computation of their pay while on active duty&rdquo; to conform to the terminology used in the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Unlike provisions of law authorizing retirement on various other grounds, R.S. 1443, which provides for the retirement of officers on their own application after 40 years of service, contains no provisions as to retired pay. R.S. 1588 provided, inter alia, that officers so retired should received retired pay at the rate of 75 percent of the sea pay of their respective grades, but that section was expressly repealed by &sect;531(a)(7) of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, leaving no specific provision for the retired pay of officers retired under R.S. 1443. It would be absurd to assume, however, that Congress intended that an officer having 40 years of service should be retired without pay, when he could have been retired with pay at any time within the preceding 20 years. By the repeal of R.S. 1588 Congress intended merely to remove obsolete and superseded provisions as to retirement at age 62 and retirement after 45 years of service, references to sea pay, and provisions, inconsistent with later law, for half pay for officers retired for other reasons. Congress intended the retired pay of officers retired after 40 years of service to be computed according to the formula prescribed generally for retired officers, other than for officers retired by reason of physical disability, and this section is worded accordingly.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is added for clarity. With respect to officers appointed under &sect;&sect;5231 or 5232 of this title it represents a necessary inference from 34 U.S.C. 410<em>o</em> and 623b(e), codified in &sect;5233 of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the word &ldquo;Regular&rdquo; is inserted before the words &ldquo;Navy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Marine Corps&rdquo; to reflect the longstanding interpretation that 34 U.S.C. 431 applies only to members of the Regular Navy and Regular Marine Corps. So much of the Act of March 2, 1907, ch. 2515, &sect;1 (34 U.S.C. 431), as pertains to allowances and rations was expressly repealed by the Act of June 16, 1942, ch. 413, 56 Stat. 369. The words &ldquo;active service in the armed forces&rdquo; are substituted for 34 U.S.C. 432 for brevity. The reference to the former Revenue Cutter Service in 34 U.S.C. 432 is omitted as obsolete, inasmuch as that Service was absorbed by the Coast Guard in 1915. If there are any enlisted men not yet retired who served in the Revenue Cutter Service, their right to count that service for the purpose of this section is protected by the saving provisions accompanying this title. The reference to active service in the Civil or Spanish-American War in 34 U.S.C. 432 is omitted as obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is inserted to cover into the section permanent enlisted members who are temporarily appointed to commissioned or warrant grades.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the word &ldquo;Federal&rdquo; is omitted and the words &ldquo;in the armed forces, other than active duty for training&rdquo; are inserted. The words &ldquo;active Federal service&rdquo; are not defined in 50 U.S.C. 1052. Section 310 of the Naval Reserve Act of 1938, which 50 U.S.C. 1052 replaced, specifies active service in the &ldquo;Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Naval Auxiliary Service, Naval Reserve Force, Naval Militia in Federal status, National Naval Volunteers, Naval Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve Force, and Marine Corps Reserve.&rdquo; 50 U.S.C. 1052 was intended to preserve the rights of persons who, on January 1, 1953, were members of reserve components, so that they would not be prejudiced by the repeal of &sect;310 of the Naval Reserve Act of 1938 (U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News, 1952, p. 3584). To effect that purpose, the service that was creditable under the 1938 Act must be creditable under 50 U.S.C. 1052. The words &ldquo;active service in the armed forces, other than active duty for training&rdquo; cover all creditable service. The Judge Advocate General of the Navy, in an opinion dated August 27, 1954 (JAG II:2:WGA:CA:mk), held that active duty for training was not creditable under the 1938 Act and is, therefore, not creditable under the 1952 Act.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;officers&rdquo; and &ldquo;assigned&rdquo; are omitted, since they are applicable only to the proviso in 34 U.S.C. 854, which is recommended for repeal as obsolete. (See Table 2A.) The words &ldquo;including (a) those former members of the Fleet Reserve who were transferred *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* but before the expiration of three months following discharge&rdquo;, appearing in &sect;803 of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 505 (34 U.S.C. 854 (note)) are omitted as surplusage. These words merely illustrate the class of persons transferred to the Fleet Reserve under the Naval Reserve Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1178, as referred to in the section from which these words were taken, and in no way limit that class or impose a citizenship requirement for membership in it. (See the opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, JAG:II:1:JFG:imz of February 17, 1953.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) reference to the date July 1, 1925, is omitted, since members who were in the naval service on or before that date may, if they are qualified and so elect, be transferred to the Fleet Reserve or to the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve under 34 U.S.C. 854c instead of under 34 U.S.C. 854b, as provided in the fifth proviso of 34 U.S.C. 854c. That proviso and the provisions of 34 U.S.C. 854b, which are applicable only to persons who were in the naval service in 1925, are not codified because they relate to a small closed class and are therefore of limited interest. They are not repealed, however. (See Table 2D.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (b) and (c) the term &ldquo;active service in the armed forces&rdquo; is substituted for the term &ldquo;active Federal service&rdquo; to execute the definition in the last sentence of 34 U.S.C. 854c.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c) the words &ldquo;is entitled, when not on active duty, to retainer pay at the rate of 21/2 percent of the basic pay that he received at the time of transfer&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;except when on active duty, shall be paid at the annual rate of 21/2 per centum of the annual base and longevity pay they are receiving at the time of transfer&rdquo; to conform to the terminology of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.).</p>
