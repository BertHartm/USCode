<p class="statutory-body">(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, each cadet at the United States Military Academy or the United States Air Force Academy, and each midshipman at the United States Naval Academy, is entitled, before graduating from that Academy, to state his preference for appointment, upon graduation, as a commissioned officer in either the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) With the consent of the Secretary of the military department administering the Academy from which the cadet or midshipman is to be graduated, and of the Secretary of the military department having jurisdiction over the armed force for which that graduate stated his preference, the graduate is entitled to be accepted for appointment in that armed force. However, not more than 12&frac12; percent of any graduating class at an Academy may be appointed in armed forces not under the jurisdiction of the military department administering that Academy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary of Defense shall, by regulation, provide for the equitable distribution of appointments in cases where more than 12&frac12; percent of the graduating class of any Academy request appointment in armed forces not under the jurisdiction of the military department administering that Academy.</p>
