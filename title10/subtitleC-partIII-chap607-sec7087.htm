<p class="statutory-body">(b) If the civilian member elects to take a reduced annuity under this section, he shall, at the time of his retirement, designate the beneficiary in writing and file the designation with the Secretary.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;under actuarial tables prepared by the Civil Service Commission&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;under the provisions of the Civil Service Retirement Act&rdquo; because that Act, as amended in 1948, no longer provides for the computation of actuarial values. The Secretary of the Navy, in administering the provisions of law codified in this section, uses tables prepared by the Civil Service Commission prior to the 1948 amendment.</p>
