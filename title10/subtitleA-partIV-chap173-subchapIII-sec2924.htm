<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the repair of military vehicles, equipment, or facility and infrastructure systems, such as lighting, heating, or cooling equipment or systems, or industrial processes, by replacement with technology that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) will achieve energy savings over the life-cycle of the equipment or system being repaired; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) will meet the same end needs as the equipment or system being repaired; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) improvements in an operation or maintenance process, such as improved training or improved controls, that result in energy savings.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) The term &ldquo;energy security&rdquo; means having assured access to reliable supplies of energy and the ability to protect and deliver sufficient energy to meet mission essential requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In selecting facility energy projects that will use renewable energy sources, pursuit of energy security means the installation will give favorable consideration to projects that provide power directly to a military facility or into the installation electrical distribution network. In such cases, projects should be prioritized to provide power for assets critical to mission essential requirements on the installation in the event of a disruption in the commercial grid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The term &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo;, with respect to a motor vehicle, means a motor vehicle that draws propulsion energy from onboard sources of stored energy that are both&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Geothermal, including electricity and heat pumps.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Municipal solid waste.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) New hydroelectric generation capacity achieved from increased efficiency or additions of new capacity at an existing hydroelectric project. For purposes of this subparagraph, hydroelectric generation capacity is &ldquo;new&rdquo; if it was placed in service on or after January 1, 1999.</p>
