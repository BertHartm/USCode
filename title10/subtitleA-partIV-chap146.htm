<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The duty to prepare a report under paragraph (1) may be delegated.

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Notification of Decision</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If, as a result of the completion of the examinations under subsection (b)(3), a decision is made to change the commercial or industrial type function that was the subject of the analysis to performance by the private sector, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report describing that decision. The report shall contain the following:</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Additional Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A commercial or industrial type function of the Department of Defense that on October 1, 1980, was being performed by Department of Defense civilian employees may not be changed to performance by a private contractor to circumvent a civilian personnel ceiling.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In no case may a commercial or industrial type function being performed by Department of Defense personnel be modified, reorganized, divided, or in any way changed for the purpose of exempting from the requirements of subsection (a) the change of all or any part of such function to performance by a private contractor.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) should be performed by a workforce composed of Department of Defense civilian employees or by a private sector workforce; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) should be reorganized or otherwise reengineered to improve the efficiency or effectiveness of the performance of the function, with a resulting decrease in the number of Department of Defense civilian employees performing the function.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>System for Monitoring Performance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a system for monitoring the performance, including the cost of performance, of each function of the Department of Defense that, after October 30, 2000, is the subject of a workforce review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The monitoring system shall be designed to compare the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The costs to perform a function before the workforce review to the costs actually incurred to perform the function after implementing the conversion, reorganization, or reengineering actions recommended by the workforce review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The anticipated savings to the actual savings, if any, resulting from conversion, reorganization, or reengineering actions undertaken in response to the workforce review.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The monitoring of a function shall continue under this section for at least five years after the conversion, reorganization, or reengineering of the function.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Waiver for Certain Workforce Reviews</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subsection (b) shall not apply to a workforce review that would result in a manpower reduction affecting fewer than 50 Department of Defense civilian employees.</p>

For each function subject to monitoring during the previous fiscal year, the report shall indicate the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The cost of the workforce review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The cost of performing the function before the workforce review compared to the costs incurred after implementing the conversion, reorganization, or reengineering actions recommended by the workforce review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The actual savings derived from the implementation of the recommendations of the workforce review, if any, compared to the anticipated savings that were to result from the conversion, reorganization, or reengineering actions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Consideration in Preparation of Future-Years Defense Program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In preparing the future-years defense program under section 221 of this title, the Secretary of Defense shall, for the fiscal years covered by the program, estimate and take into account the costs to be incurred and the savings to be derived from the performance of functions by workforces selected in workforce reviews.

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Conditions on Expanded Use</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of a military department, as the case may be, may not enter into a prime vendor contract for depot-level maintenance and repair of a weapon system or other military equipment described in section 2464(a)(3) of title 10, United States Code, before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the Secretary submits to Congress a report, specific to the proposed contract, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) describes the competitive procedures to be used to award the prime vendor contract;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) contains an analysis of costs and benefits that demonstrates that use of the prime vendor contract will result in savings to the Government over the life of the contract;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) contains an analysis of the extent to which the contract conforms to the requirements of section 2466 of title 10, United States Code; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) describes the measures taken to ensure that the contract does not violate the core logistics policies, requirements, and restrictions set forth in section 2464 of that title.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The term &lsquo;prime vendor contract&rsquo; means an innovative contract that gives a defense contractor the responsibility to manage, store, and distribute inventory, manage and provide services, or manage and perform research, on behalf of the Department of Defense on a frequent, regular basis, for users within the Department on request. The term includes contracts commonly referred to as prime vendor support contracts, flexible sustainment contracts, and direct vendor delivery contracts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The term &lsquo;depot-level maintenance and repair&rsquo; has the meaning given such term in section 2460 of title 10, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Relationship to Other Laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt a prime vendor contract from the requirements of section 2461 of title 10, United States Code, or any other provision of chapter 146 of such title.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Policy Regarding Performance of Depot-Level Maintenance and Repair for Department of Defense</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 311 of Pub. L. 104&ndash;106, as amended by Pub. L. 105&ndash;85, div. A, title III, &sect;363, Nov. 18, 1997, 111 Stat. 1702, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The Department of Defense does not have a comprehensive policy regarding the performance of depot-level maintenance and repair of military equipment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The absence of such a policy has caused the Congress to establish guidelines for the performance of such functions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) It is essential to the national security of the United States that the Department of Defense maintain an organic capability within the department, including skilled personnel, technical competencies, equipment, and facilities, to perform depot-level maintenance and repair of military equipment in order to ensure that the Armed Forces of the United States are able to meet training, operational, mobilization, and emergency requirements without impediment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The organic capability of the Department of Defense to perform depot-level maintenance and repair of military equipment must satisfy known and anticipated core maintenance and repair requirements across the full range of peacetime and wartime scenarios.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Although it is possible that savings can be achieved by contracting with private-sector sources for the performance of some work currently performed by Department of Defense depots, the Department of Defense has not determined the type or amount of work that should be performed under contract with private-sector sources nor the relative costs and benefits of contracting for the performance of such work by those sources.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Sense of Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that there is a compelling need for the Department of Defense to articulate known and anticipated core maintenance and repair requirements, to organize the resources of the Department of Defense to meet those requirements economically and efficiently, and to determine what work should be performed by the private sector and how such work should be managed.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Requirement for Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than March 31, 1996, the Secretary of Defense shall develop and report to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives [now Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives] a comprehensive policy on the performance of depot-level maintenance and repair for the Department of Defense that maintains the capability described in section 2464 of title 10, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Content of Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In developing the policy, the Secretary of Defense shall do each of the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Identify for each military department, with the concurrence of the Secretary of that military department, those depot-level maintenance and repair activities that are necessary to ensure the depot-level <!-- PDFPage:1075 -->maintenance and repair capability as required by section 2464 of title 10, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Provide for performance of core depot-level maintenance and repair capabilities in facilities owned and operated by the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Provide for the core capabilities to include sufficient skilled personnel, equipment, and facilities that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) is of the proper size (i) to ensure a ready and controlled source of technical competence and repair and maintenance capability necessary to meet the requirements of the National Military Strategy and other requirements for responding to mobilizations and military contingencies, and (ii) to provide for rapid augmentation in time of emergency; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) is assigned sufficient workload to ensure cost efficiency and technical proficiency in time of peace.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Address environmental liability.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) In the case of depot-level maintenance and repair workloads in excess of the workload required to be performed by Department of Defense depots, provide for competition for those workloads between public and private entities when there is sufficient potential for realizing cost savings based on adequate private-sector competition and technical capabilities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Address issues concerning exchange of technical data between the Federal Government and the private sector.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Provide for, in the Secretary's discretion and after consultation with the Secretaries of the military departments, the transfer from one military department to another, in accordance with merit-based selection processes, workload that supports the core depot-level maintenance and repair capabilities in facilities owned and operated by the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Require that, in any competition for a workload (whether among private-sector sources or between depot-level activities of the Department of Defense and private-sector sources), bids are evaluated under a methodology that ensures that appropriate costs to the Government and the private sector are identified.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Provide for the performance of maintenance and repair for any new weapons systems defined as core, under section 2464 of title 10, United States Code, in facilities owned and operated by the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) <cap-smallcap>Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In developing the policy, the Secretary shall take into consideration the following matters:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The national security interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The capabilities of the public depots and the capabilities of businesses in the private sector to perform the maintenance and repair work required by the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Any applicable recommendations of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission that are required to be implemented under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 [part A of title XXIX of div. B of Pub. L. 101&ndash;510, set out as a note under section 2687 of this title].</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The extent to which the readiness of the Armed Forces would be affected by a necessity to construct new facilities to accommodate any redistribution of depot-level maintenance and repair workloads that is made in accordance with the recommendation of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, that such workloads be consolidated at Department of Defense depots or private-sector facilities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Analyses of costs and benefits of alternatives, including a comparative analysis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the costs and benefits, including any readiness implications, of any proposed policy to convert to contractor performance of depot-level maintenance and repair workloads where the workload is being performed by Department of Defense personnel; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) the costs and benefits, including any readiness implications, of a policy to transfer depot-level maintenance and repair workloads among depots.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;[(f), (g) Repealed. Pub. L. 105&ndash;85, div. A, title III, &sect;363, Nov. 18, 1997, 111 Stat. 1702.]</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(h) <cap-smallcap>Review by General Accounting Office</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall make available to the Comptroller General of the United States all information used by the Department of Defense in developing the policy under subsections (c) through (e) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) Not later than 45 days after the date on which the Secretary submits to Congress the report required by subsection (c), the Comptroller General shall transmit to Congress a report containing a detailed analysis of the Secretary's proposed policy as reported under such subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(i) <cap-smallcap>Report on Depot-Level Maintenance and Repair Workload</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than March 31, 1996, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report on the depot-level maintenance and repair workload of the Department of Defense. The report shall, to the maximum extent practicable, include the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) An analysis of the need for and effect of the requirement under section 2466 of title 10, United States Code, that no more than 40 percent of the depot-level maintenance and repair work of the Department of Defense be contracted for performance by non-Government personnel, including a description of the effect on military readiness and the national security resulting from that requirement and a description of any specific difficulties experienced by the Department of Defense as a result of that requirement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) An analysis of the distribution during the five fiscal years ending with fiscal year 1995 of the depot-level maintenance and repair workload of the Department of Defense between depot-level activities of the Department of Defense and non-Government personnel, measured by direct labor hours and by amounts expended, and displayed, for that five-year period and for each year of that period, so as to show (for each military department (and separately for the Navy and Marine Corps)) such distribution.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) A projection of the distribution during the five fiscal years beginning with fiscal year 1997 of the depot-level maintenance and repair workload of the Department of Defense between depot-level activities of the Department of Defense and non-Government personnel, measured by direct labor hours and by amounts expended, and displayed, for that five-year period and for each year of that period, so as to show (for each military department (and separately for the Navy and Marine Corps)) such distribution that would be accomplished under a new policy as required under subsection (c).</p>
