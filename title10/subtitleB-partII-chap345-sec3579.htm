<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the word &ldquo;commissioned&rdquo; is inserted for clarity. The words &ldquo;Except as provided in section 94 of this title&rdquo;, not contained in section 1169 of the Revised Statutes, but contained in 10:94, are omitted as surplusage, since 10:94 deals exclusively with assignments. The words &ldquo;except within the Army Medical Service&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;in the line or in other staff corps&rdquo;. Officers of the Army Nurse Corps and Women's Medical Specialist Corps are not covered by subsection (a), since their command authority is specifically stated in subsection (b).</p>
