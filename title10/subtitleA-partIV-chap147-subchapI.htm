<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Private Operation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Under such regulations as the Secretary of Defense may approve, private persons may operate selected commissary store functions, except that such functions may not include functions relating to the procurement of products to be sold in a commissary store or functions relating to the overall management of a commissary system or the management of a commissary store. Such functions shall be carried out by personnel of the Department of Defense under regulations approved by the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any change to private operation of a commissary store function that is being performed by more than 10 Department of Defense civilian employees shall not take effect until the end of the 75-day period beginning on the date on which the Secretary of Defense submits to Congress written notice of the change.

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Governing Board</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Notwithstanding section 192(d) of this title, the Secretary of Defense shall establish a governing board for the commissary system to provide advice to the Secretary regarding the prudent operation of the commissary system and to assist in the overall supervision of the Defense Commissary Agency. The Secretary may authorize the board to have such supervisory authority as the Secretary considers appropriate to permit the board to carry out its responsibilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall determine the membership of the governing board, which shall include, at a minimum, appropriate representatives from each military department. The chairman of the governing board shall be a commissioned officer or member of the senior executive service who has demonstrated experience or knowledge relevant to the management of the defense commissary system. In selecting other members of the governing board, the Secretary shall give priority to persons with experience related to logistics, military personnel, military entitlements or other experiences of value of management of commissaries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The governing board shall be accountable only to the Secretary of Defense and to the civilian officer of the Department of Defense who is assigned the responsibility for the overall supervision of the Defense Commissary Agency pursuant to section 192(a) of this title.

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Reimbursement for Use of Commissary Facilities by Military Departments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of a military department shall pay the Defense Commissary Agency the amount determined under paragraph (2) for any use of a commissary facility by the military department for a purpose other than commissary sales or operations in support of commissary sales.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount payable under paragraph (1) for use of a commissary facility by a military department shall be equal to the share of depre<!-- PDFPage:1261 -->ciation of the facility that is attributable to that use, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Director of the Defense Commissary Agency shall credit amounts paid under paragraph (1) for use of a facility to an appropriate account to which proceeds of a surcharge applied under section 2484(d) of this title are credited.</p>
