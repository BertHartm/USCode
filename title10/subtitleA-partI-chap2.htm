<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 103&ndash;160, div. A, title IX, subtitle E, Nov. 30, 1993, 107 Stat. 1738, as amended by Pub. L. 103&ndash;337, div. A, title IX, &sect;923(a)(1), (2), (b)&ndash;(d), Oct. 5, 1994, 108 Stat. 2830, 2831, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 951. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The current allocation of roles and missions among the Armed Forces evolved from the practice during World War II to meet the Cold War threat and may no longer be appropriate for the post-Cold War era.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Many analysts believe that a realignment of those roles and mission [sic] is essential for the efficiency and effectiveness of the Armed Forces, particularly in light of lower budgetary resources that will be available to the Department of Defense in the future.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The existing process of a triennial review of roles and missions by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff pursuant to provisions of law enacted by the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 [see Short Title of 1986 Amendment note above] has not produced the comprehensive review envisioned by Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) It is difficult for any organization, and may be particularly difficult for the Department of Defense, to reform itself without the benefit and authority provided by external perspectives and analysis.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 952. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Establishment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There is hereby established a commission to be known as the Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces (hereinafter in this subtitle referred to as the &lsquo;Commission&rsquo;).</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(3) The Secretary shall designate one of the members as chairman of the Commission.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Period of Appointment; Vacancies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Members shall be appointed for the life of the Commission. Any vacancy in the Commission shall not affect its powers, but shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Initial Organizational Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall make all appointments to the Commission within 45 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Nov. 30, 1993].</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) The Commission shall convene its first meeting within 30 days after the first date on which all members of the Commission have been appointed. At that meeting, the Commission shall develop an agenda and a schedule for carrying out its duties.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) review the efficacy and appropriateness for the post-Cold War era of the current allocations among the Armed Forces of roles, missions, and functions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) evaluate and report on alternative allocations of those roles, missions, and functions; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) make recommendations for changes in the current definition and distribution of those roles, missions, and functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Review of Potential Military Operations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Commission shall review the types of military operations that may be required in the post-Cold War era, taking into account the requirements for success in various types of operations. As part of such review, the Commission shall take into consideration the official strategic planning of the Department of Defense. The types of operations to be considered by the Commission as part of such review shall include the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Defense of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Warfare against other national military forces.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Participation in peacekeeping, peace enforcement, and other nontraditional activities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Action against nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons capabilities in hostile hands.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Support of law enforcement.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Development of Conceptual Framework for Organizational Allocations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Commission shall develop a conceptual framework for the review of the organizational allocation among the Armed Forces of military roles, missions, and functions. In developing that framework, the Commission shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) static efficiency (such as duplicative overhead and economies of scale);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) dynamic effectiveness (including the benefits of competition and the effect on innovation);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) interoperability, responsiveness, and other aspects of military effectiveness in the field;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) gaps in mission coverage and so-called orphan missions that are inadequately served by existing organizational entities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) division of responsibility on the battlefield;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) exploitation of new technology and operational concepts;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the degree of disruption that a change in roles and missions would entail;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) the experience of other nations; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the role of the Army National Guard of the United States, the Air National Guard of the United States, and the other reserve components.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) <cap-smallcap>Recommendations Concerning Military Roles and Missions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Based upon the conceptual framework <!-- PDFPage:24 -->developed under subsection (d) to evaluate possible changes to the existing allocation among the Armed Forces of military roles, missions, and functions, the Commission shall recommend&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the functions for which each military department should organize, train, and equip forces;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the missions of combatant commands; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the roles that Congress should assign to the various military elements of the Department of Defense, including the Army National Guard of the United States, the Air National Guard of the United States, and the other reserve components.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(f) <cap-smallcap>Recommendations Concerning Civilian Elements of Department of Defense</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Commission may address the roles, missions, and functions of civilian portions of the Department of Defense and other national security agencies to the extent that changes in these areas are collateral to changes considered in military roles, missions, and functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(g) <cap-smallcap>Recommendations Concerning Process for Future Changes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Commission shall also recommend a process for continuing to adapt the roles, missions, and functions of the Armed Forces to future changes in technology and in the international security environment.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(h) <cap-smallcap>Recommendations Concerning Reserve Components</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Commission shall also address the roles, missions, and functions of the Army National Guard of the United States, the Air National Guard of the United States, and the other reserve components within the total force of the Armed Forces, particularly in light of lower budgetary resources that will be available to the Department of Defense in the future.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(i) <cap-smallcap>Recommendations Concerning Programs and Force Structure</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Commission may also recommend changes that would better align programs and force structure with projected missions and threats.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1988 Act  </h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (k) is based on Pub. L. 100&ndash;202, &sect;101(b) [title VIII, &sect;8042], 101 Stat. 1329&ndash;69.  </p>
<p class="note-body">Section 8042 of the FY88 Defense Appropriations Act (Public Law 100&ndash;202) established a requirement for the Secretary of Defense to submit an annual report on the cost of stationing United States forces overseas. Under that section, the annual report is to be sent to the Committees on Appropriations of the two Houses. In codifying that section as section 113(k) of title 10, the committee added the two Armed Services Committees as committees to be sent the annual report. This minor change from the source law does not change the nature of the report to be submitted.  </p>
<p class="note-body">The committee notes that the source section does not specify the period of time to be covered by the report. In the absence of statutory language specifying the period to be covered by the report, it would seem reasonable to conclude that the report should cover the previous fiscal year. The committee notes, however, that the report of the Senate Appropriations Committee on its FY88 defense appropriations bill (S. Rpt. 100&ndash;235) states that this new annual report &ldquo;should cover the budget years and the 2 previous fiscal years&rdquo; (page 54). The committee believes that such a requirement may be unnecessarily burdensome and in any case, if such a requirement is intended, should be stated in the statute. In the absence of clear intent, the provision is proposed to be codified without specifying the period of time to be covered by the annual report.  </p>
<p class="note-body">In codifying this provision, the committee also changed the term &ldquo;United States troops&rdquo; in the source law to &ldquo;United States forces&rdquo; for consistency in usage in title 10 and as being preferable usage. No change in meaning is intended. The committee also changed &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; to &ldquo;outside the United States&rdquo; and defined &ldquo;United States&rdquo; for this purpose to include the territories and possessions of the United States. The committee was concerned that the term &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; read literally could include Hawaii or Guam, an interpretation clearly not intended in enacting section 8042. The committee notes that the Senate report referred to above states &ldquo;For the purposes of this report [meaning the new DOD annual report], U.S. forces stationed overseas are considered to be those outside of the United States and its territories.&rdquo;. The committee extrapolates from this statement that provisions in the report requirement relating to expenditures &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; and costs incurred &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; are also to be construed as relating to matters outside the United States and its territories and has prepared the codified provision accordingly.  </p>
