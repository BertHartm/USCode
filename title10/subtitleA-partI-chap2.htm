<h4 class="note-head">1988 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (k) is based on Pub. L. 100&ndash;202, &sect;101(b) [title VIII, &sect;8042], 101 Stat. 1329&ndash;69.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 8042 of the FY88 Defense Appropriations Act (Public Law 100&ndash;202) established a requirement for the Secretary of Defense to submit an annual report on the cost of stationing United States forces overseas. Under that section, the annual report is to be sent to the Committees on Appropriations of the two Houses. In codifying that section as section 113(k) of title 10, the committee added the two Armed Services Committees as committees to be sent the annual report. This minor change from the source law does not change the nature of the report to be submitted.</p>
<p class="note-body">The committee notes that the source section does not specify the period of time to be covered by the report. In the absence of statutory language specifying the period to be covered by the report, it would seem reasonable to conclude that the report should cover the previous fiscal year. The committee notes, however, that the report of the Senate Appropriations Committee on its FY88 defense appropriations bill (S. Rpt. 100&ndash;235) states that this new annual report &ldquo;should cover the budget years and the 2 previous fiscal years&rdquo; (page 54). The committee believes that such a requirement may be unnecessarily burdensome and in any case, if such a requirement is intended, should be stated in the statute. In the absence of clear intent, the provision is proposed to be codified without specifying the period of time to be covered by the annual report.</p>
<p class="note-body">In codifying this provision, the committee also changed the term &ldquo;United States troops&rdquo; in the source law to &ldquo;United States forces&rdquo; for consistency in usage in title 10 and as being preferable usage. No change in meaning is intended. The committee also changed &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; to &ldquo;outside the United States&rdquo; and defined &ldquo;United States&rdquo; for this purpose to include the territories and possessions of the United States. The committee was concerned that the term &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; read literally could include Hawaii or Guam, an interpretation clearly not intended in enacting section 8042. The committee notes that the Senate report referred to above states &ldquo;For the purposes of this report [meaning the new DOD annual report], U.S. forces stationed overseas are considered to be those outside of the United States and its territories.&rdquo;. The committee extrapolates from this statement that provisions in the report requirement relating to expenditures &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; and costs incurred &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; are also to be construed as relating to matters outside the United States and its territories and has prepared the codified provision accordingly.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Annual Report on Moratorium on Use by Armed Forces of Antipersonnel Landmines</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 1309 of Pub. L. 105&ndash;85 provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The United States has stated its support for a ban on antipersonnel landmines that is global in scope and verifiable.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) On May 16, 1996, the President announced that the United States, as a matter of policy, would eliminate its stockpile of non-self-destructing antipersonnel landmines, except those used for training purposes and in Korea, and that the United States would reserve the right to use self-destructing antipersonnel landmines in the event of conflict.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) On May 16, 1996, the President also announced that the United States would lead an effort to negotiate an international treaty permanently banning the use of all antipersonnel landmines.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The United States is currently participating at the United Nations Conference on Disarmament in negotiations aimed at achieving a global ban on the use of antipersonnel landmines.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) On August 18, 1997, the administration agreed to participate in international negotiations sponsored by Canada (the so-called &lsquo;Ottawa process&rsquo;) designed to achieve a treaty that would outlaw the production, use, and sale of antipersonnel landmines.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) On September 17, 1997, the President announced that the United States would not sign the antipersonnel landmine treaty concluded in Oslo, Norway, by participants in the Ottawa process because the treaty would not provide a geographic exception to allow the United States to stockpile and use antipersonnel landmines in Korea or an exemption that would preserve the ability of the United States to use mixed antitank mine systems which could be used to deter an armored assault against United States forces.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The President also announced a change in United States policy whereby the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) would no longer deploy antipersonnel landmines, including self-destructing antipersonnel landmines, by 2003, except in Korea;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) would seek to field alternatives by that date, or by 2006 in the case of Korea;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) would undertake a new initiative in the United Nations Conference on Disarmament to establish a global ban on the transfer of antipersonnel landmines; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) would increase its current humanitarian demining activities around the world.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The President's decision would allow the continued use by United States forces of self-destructing antipersonnel landmines that are used as part of a mixed antitank mine system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Under existing law (as provided in section 580 of Public Law 104&ndash;107; 110 Stat. 751), on February 12, 1999, the United States will implement a one-year moratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines by United States forces except along internationally recognized national borders or in demilitarized zones within a perimeter marked area that is monitored by military personnel and protected by adequate means to ensure the exclusion of civilians.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Sense of Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the United States should not implement a moratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines by United States Armed Forces in a manner that would endanger United States personnel or undermine the military effectiveness of United States Armed Forces in executing their missions; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the United States should pursue the development of alternatives to self-destructing antipersonnel landmines.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Annual Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than December 31 each year, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense committees [Committees on Armed Services and Appropriations of Senate and House of Representatives] a report concerning antipersonnel landmines.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The military utility of the continued deployment and use by the United States of antipersonnel landmines.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The effect of a moratorium on the production, stockpiling, and use of antipersonnel landmines on the ability of United States forces to deter and defend against attack on land by hostile forces, including on the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Progress in developing and fielding systems that are effective substitutes for antipersonnel landmines, including an identification and description of the types of systems that are being developed and fielded, the costs associated with those systems, and the estimated timetable for developing and fielding those systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The effect of a moratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines on the military effectiveness of current antitank mine systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The number and type of pure antipersonnel landmines that remain in the United States inventory and that are subject to elimination under the President's September 17, 1997, declaration on United States antipersonnel landmine policy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The number and type of mixed antitank mine systems that are in the United States inventory, the locations where they are deployed, and their effect on the deterrence and warfighting ability of United States Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The effect of the elimination of pure antipersonnel landmines on the warfighting effectiveness of the United States Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The costs already incurred and anticipated of eliminating antipersonnel landmines from the United States inventory in accordance with the policy enunciated by the President on September 17, 1997.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The benefits that would result to United States military and civilian personnel from an international treaty banning the production, use, transfer, and stockpiling of antipersonnel landmines.&rdquo;</p>
