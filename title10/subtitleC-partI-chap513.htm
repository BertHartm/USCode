<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the language that incorporates the rank, pay, and allowances of chiefs of bureaus of the War Department for chiefs of bureaus is executed. Creation of the Department of the Air Force by the National Security Act of 1947, and the saving provisions in &sect;305 of that act, would relate chiefs of bureaus of the Navy to the corresponding officers of both the other military departments. Since there is now positive organizational law for both of those departments providing the grades of the departmental officers, and, since in the reorganization of the departments, there is no precise counterpart of the chief of a Navy bureau, it is inappropriate to continue the incorporation by reference. Subsection (a), therefore, provides that bureau chiefs are entitled to have the rank of rear admiral with pay and allowances of a rear admiral in the upper half, which, under &sect;516 of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, corresponds with major general. The subsection also recognizes the possibility of appointing an officer of the Marine Corps as Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics by providing that such an appointee has the rank, pay, and allowances of a major general.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;from officers on the active list of the Navy in the Medical Corps&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;from the list of Surgeons of the Navy&rdquo; to conform to present statutory terminology, and the words &ldquo;or from officers having the rank of captain in the staff corps of the Navy&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete in view of the subsequent changes in staff corps grades and the establishment of grades and ranks higher than captain in the staff corps. R.S. 421 and 426 were derived from the Act of July 5, 1862, ch. 134, 12 Stat. 510, and the Act of Mar. 3, 1871, ch. 117, &sect;10, 16 Stat. 537. The Act of July 5, 1862, provided that the Chief of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery should be appointed from the list of surgeons in the Navy. At that time the senior medical officers were &ldquo;surgeons&rdquo; who &ldquo;ranked with&rdquo; commanders. Next junior to them were &ldquo;surgeons&rdquo; who &ldquo;ranked with&rdquo; lieutenants. The rank of lieutenant commander did not exist. The Act of Mar. 3, 1871, established five grades in the Medical Corps of which two, medical director and medical inspector, were higher than the grade of surgeon. Medical directors were given the relative rank of captain, medical inspectors the relative rank of commander, and surgeons the relative rank of lieutenant commander or lieutenant. The 1871 Act further provided that chiefs of bureaus might be appointed from officers having the relative rank of captain in the staff corps. This provision was probably intended to insure that the assignment of new grades and titles to senior staff corps officers should not be construed as a bar to their appointment as bureau chiefs. However, it was interpreted by the Commissioners who drafted the Revised Statutes as setting up a new category of officers from which bureau chiefs could be appointed, and it was therefore stated, in R.S. 421, as an alternative to each of the other categories specified for the various Bureaus in the 1862 Act and reenacted in R.S. 422&ndash;426. Thus the Chief of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery could be appointed from surgeons, who had the relative rank of lieutenant commander or lieutenant in the Medical Corps, or from officers having the relative rank of captain in the Medical Corps, Pay Corps, or Engineer Corps. Section 405 of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 (34 U.S.C. 10a) abolished the grade of surgeon and other staff corps grades and replaced them with grades having the same titles as the grades and ranks in the line. Officers who were &ldquo;surgeons&rdquo; are now &ldquo;lieutenant commanders and lieutenants in the Medical Corps.&rdquo; If this literal translation is made in R.S. 426 and the eligibility of all staff corps captains, as stated in R.S. 421, is retained, an absurd result is reached; i.e., lieutenants, lieutenant commanders, and captains in the Medical Corps are eligible for appointment as Chief of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery; but commanders and rear admirals in that corps are ineligible; captains, but not rear admirals, in other staff corps are eligible by virtue of their rank alone, regardless of their lack of training in medicine. It appears, therefore, that the only reasonable meaning that can be given to R.S. 421 and 426 at the present time is that the Chief of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery must be an officer of the Medical Corps.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the words &ldquo;Deputy Chief of the Bureau&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;assistant to the Bureau&rdquo; for uniformity. The words &ldquo;An officer on the active list of the Navy in the Medical Corps&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;A surgeon, assistant surgeon, or passed assistant surgeon&rdquo; to conform to present statutory terminology and to describe clearly the class of officers eligible for detail under this subsection. When <!-- PDFPage:1244 -->the source statute was enacted there was no class of officers exactly corresponding to officers of the present Naval Reserve, and retired officers could be called to active duty only in time of war, so that the detailing of an officer not on the active list as assistant to the bureau chief was probably not contemplated. Further, since the assistant or deputy must at times perform the duties of the chief, it is reasonable to assume that he was intended to be in the same category of officers. Later statutes relating to the Assistant Chiefs of the Bureau of Aeronautics and the Bureau of Ships, enacted at a time when there were Reserve officers and when retired officers could be called to duty at any time with their consent, specify that the assistant chiefs shall be officers on the active list.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;from officers on the active list in the line of the Navy&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;from the list of officers of the Navy&rdquo; to conform to current terminology. Line officers alone had the &ldquo;grade&rdquo; of commander when the source statute was enacted. The words &ldquo;or from officers having the rank of captain in the staff corps of the Navy&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete in view of subsequent changes in the staff corps and in the staff corps ranks and grades. These words were derived from the Act of Mar. 3, 1871, ch. 117, &sect;10, 16 Stat. 537, which established new staff corps grades and assigned to officers in the highest grade the relative rank of captain. They were probably intended merely to assure the eligibility of senior staff corps officers for appointment as chiefs of appropriate staff bureaus. However, as incorporated in R.S. 421, they provide a category of eligible officers which is an alternative to each of the categories listed in R.S. 422&ndash;426. Thus R.S. 421 and R.S. 422, as originally enacted, provided that the chiefs of the four &ldquo;line&rdquo; bureaus, Yards and Docks, Navigation, Ordnance, and Equipment and Recruiting, could be appointed from line officers not below the grade of commander or from officers having the relative rank of captain in any staff corps. Pursuant to these sections the Attorney General held in 1898 that an officer having the relative rank of captain in the Civil Engineer Corps could legally be appointed as Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (22 Op. Atty. Gen. 47, 17 Mar. 1898). There is some confusion in the opinion as to which corps was meant. The proposed appointee was a member of the Civil Engineer Corps, but the Corps of Engineers is the corps mentioned in the conclusion of the opinion. A provision in the Act of June 29, 1906, ch. 3590, 34 Stat. 564, requires that the Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks be selected from officers of the Civil Engineer Corps, so that there is no longer any question as to that bureau. The Bureau of Equipment and Recruiting has been abolished, leaving only the Bureau of Naval Personnel (formerly Navigation) and the Bureau of Ordnance of the four &ldquo;line&rdquo; bureaus originally listed in R.S. 422. The statutes establishing new &ldquo;line&rdquo; bureaus, the Bureau of Ships and the Bureau of Aeronautics, contain their own requirements as to the qualifications of the chiefs. The abolition of the Corps of Engineers and the Construction Corps, with the transfer of officers in those corps to the line, has eliminated the only staff corps whose members had duties closely related to those of line officers. The present staff corps, with the possible exception of the Supply Corps, are all highly specialized. Furthermore, in five of the seven corps, captain is no longer the highest grade. In view of these facts it is considered that the provision of R.S. 421 making staff corps captains eligible for appointment as Chief of the Bureaus of Naval Personnel and Ordnance is obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the words &ldquo;An officer on the active list in the line of the Navy not below the grade of commander&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;An officer of the Navy not below the rank of commander&rdquo; to conform to current terminology and for clarity. When the source statute was enacted only line officers had the actual rank of commander. The words &ldquo;on the active list&rdquo; are inserted for the reasons stated in the revision note on &sect;5137(b) of this title. The words &ldquo;Deputy Chief&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;assistant to the Chief&rdquo; for the reason stated in the revision note on &sect;5134 of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the rank, pay, allowances, and privileges of retirement of chiefs of bureaus of the Navy are incorporated. 5 U.S.C. 441 apparently relates the Judge Advocate General of the Navy to the Judge Advocate General of the Army, as well as to bureau chiefs. However, since the creation of the Department of the Air Force by the National Security Act of 1947, if the incorporation to the Army provision is retained, the saving provisions in the act require an incorporation also to the rank, etc., of the Judge Advocate General of the Air Force. The rank of the Judge Advocate General of each of the other departments is now specified in organizational law to be major general. Since it is possible that these ranks may at some future time not be the same, incorporation by reference to them is no longer appropriate. Instead, the section relates the Judge Advocate General's rank, pay, allowances, and privileges of retirement to those of bureau chiefs as does 5 U.S.C. 441, in part.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), clauses (1) and (4) are substituted for the words &ldquo;and perform such other duties as have heretofore been performed by the Solicitor and Naval Judge Advocate General&rdquo; to describe the duties of the Judge Advocate General directly instead of by reference to the duties performed by an officer whose office was abolished more than 75 years ago.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c)(2) is substituted for the reference, in 5 U.S.C. 428, to courts-martial and courts of inquiry, since the Uniform Code of Military Justice has superseded prior law as to the duties of the Judge Advocates General relating to these courts.</p>
