<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Program Required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense, acting through the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, shall carry out a program to provide opportunities for the increased introduction of innovative and cost-saving technology in acquisition programs of the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The program, to be known as the Defense Acquisition Challenge Program (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Challenge Program&rdquo;), shall provide any person or activity within or outside the Department of Defense with the opportunity to propose alternatives, to be known as challenge proposals, at the component, subsystem, or system level of an existing Department of Defense acquisition program that would result in improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability of that acquisition program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Panels</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Under Secretary shall establish one or more panels of highly qualified scientists and engineers (hereinafter in this section referred to as &ldquo;Panels&rdquo;) to provide preliminary evaluations of challenge proposals under subsection (c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Preliminary Evaluation by Panels</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Under procedures prescribed by the Under Secretary, a person or activity within or outside the Department of Defense may submit challenge proposals to a Panel, through the unsolicited proposal process or in response to a broad agency announcement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Under Secretary shall establish procedures pursuant to which appropriate officials of the Department of Defense may identify proposals submitted through the unsolicited proposal process as challenge proposals. The procedures shall provide for the expeditious referral of such proposals to a Panel for preliminary evaluation under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Under Secretary shall issue on an annual basis not less than one such broad agency announcement inviting interested parties to submit challenge proposals. Such announcements may also identify particular technology areas and acquisition programs that will be given priority in the evaluation of challenge proposals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Under procedures established by the Under Secretary, a Panel shall carry out a preliminary evaluation of each challenge proposal submitted in response to a broad agency announcement, or submitted through the unsolicited proposal process and identified as a challenge proposal in accordance with paragraph (2), to determine each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Whether the challenge proposal has merit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Whether the challenge proposal is likely to result in improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability at the component, subsystem, or system level of an acquisition program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Whether the challenge proposal could be implemented in the acquisition program rapidly, at an acceptable cost, and without unacceptable disruption to the acquisition program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Under Secretary may establish procedures to ensure that the Challenge Program does not become an avenue for the repetitive submission of proposals that have been previously reviewed and found not to have merit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) If a Panel determines that a challenge proposal satisfies each of the criteria specified in paragraph (4), the person or activity submitting that challenge proposal shall be provided an opportunity to submit such challenge proposal for a full review and evaluation under subsection (d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Full Review and Evaluation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Under procedures prescribed by the Under Secretary, for each challenge proposal submitted for a full review and evaluation as provided in subsection (c)(6), the office carrying out the acquisition program to which the proposal relates shall, in consultation with the prime system contractor carrying out such program, conduct a full review and evaluation of the proposal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The full review and evaluation shall, independent of the determination of a Panel under subsection (c)(4), determine each of the matters specified in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of such subsection. The full review and evaluation shall also include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an assessment of the cost of adopting the challenge proposal and implementing it in the acquisition program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) consideration of any intellectual property issues associated with the challenge proposal.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Action Upon Favorable Full Review and Evaluation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Under procedures prescribed by the Under Secretary, each challenge proposal determined under a full review and evaluation to satisfy each of the criteria specified in subsection (c)(4) with respect to an acquisition program shall be considered by the office carrying out the applicable acquisition program and the prime system contractor for incorporation into the acquisition program as a new technology insertion at the component, subsystem, or system level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Under Secretary shall encourage the adoption of each challenge proposal referred to in paragraph (1) by providing suitable incentives to the office carrying out the acquisition program and the prime system contractor carrying out such program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Access to Technical Resources</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Under procedures established by the Under Secretary, the technical resources of the laboratories, research, development, and engineering <!-- PDFPage:1047 -->centers, test and evaluation activities, and other elements of the Department may be called upon to support the activities of the Challenge Program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Funds available to carry out this program may be used to compensate such laboratories, centers, activities, and elements for technical assistance provided to a Panel pursuant to paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Elimination of Conflicts of Interest</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out each preliminary evaluation under subsection (c) and full review under subsection (d), the Under Secretary shall ensure the elimination of conflicts of interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Use of Funds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Funds made available for the Challenge Program may be used only for activities authorized by this section, and not for implementation of challenge proposals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Annual Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Under Secretary shall submit an annual report on the Challenge Program to Congress. The report shall be submitted at the same time as the President submits the budget for a fiscal year to Congress under section 1105(a) of title 31, and shall cover the conduct of the Challenge Program for the preceding fiscal year. The report shall include the number and scope of challenge proposals submitted, preliminarily evaluated, subjected to full review and evaluation, and adopted. No report is required for a fiscal year in which the Challenge Program is not carried out.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Termination of Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not carry out the Challenge Program under this section after September 30, 2007.</p>
