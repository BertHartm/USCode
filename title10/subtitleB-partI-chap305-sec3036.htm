If the President declines to appoint any of the recommended officers, or if the officer nominated cannot be appointed because of advice by the Senate, the Secretary shall convene a board to recommend additional officers. An officer who is recommended but not appointed shall be considered not to have been recommended. This does not affect his eligibility for selection and recommendations for the grade of brigadier general or major general under section 3306 or 3307 of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), all references to the appointment of assistant chiefs are omitted as covered by sections 3037 and 3040 of this title. All references to the grade of brigadier general are omitted, since 10:21f(b) specifies the grade of major general for the offices. 10:559g(a) (4th sentence) is omitted as surplusage, since the appointment is to a permanent grade. 10:559g(a) (6th and 7th sentences) is omitted as executed. 10:559g(a) (last sentence) is omitted, since the revised section applies only to the officers named in subsection (a). The words &ldquo;except the Judge Advocate General&rdquo; are inserted for clarity. The eight words before clause (1), and clauses (1) and (2), are substituted for the words &ldquo;as prescribed in section 559g of this title&rdquo;, in 10:21f(b), and 10:559g(a) (1st sentence). The second sentence is substituted for 10:559g(a) (2d sentence) and 10:21f(b) (1st 15 words). The words &ldquo;selected and&rdquo;, in 10:21f(b), are omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;arms, or services&rdquo;, in 10:559g(a) are omitted as obsolete, since sections 3063 and 3064 of this title designate the former arms and services as &ldquo;branches&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;normally holds office&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;shall normally continue in that assignment for a tour of duty&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;appointment&rdquo; and &ldquo;office&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;assignment&rdquo; and &ldquo;tour of duty&rdquo; whenever they are used in that sense.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the introductory clause is substituted for 10:559g(b) (words before colon of 1st sentence). The words &ldquo;in a grade above major general&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;of a rank above that of the position for which selections are to be made&rdquo;, since all the positions are in the grade of major general. The word &ldquo;select&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;appoint&rdquo;, since the filling of the offices is not appointment to an office in the constitutional sense. The word &ldquo;extensive&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;extended&rdquo;, except where it refers to &ldquo;extended&rdquo; active duty, in which case the word &ldquo;extended&rdquo; is omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;the name of&rdquo; are inserted for clarity. The words &ldquo;appointed in, or assigned to&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;of the&rdquo;, and &ldquo;in the&rdquo;, before the words &ldquo;that branch&rdquo;, to conform to sections 3063 and 3064 of this title. The word &ldquo;regular&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;each regular or reserve officer&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;of officers of any component of the Army of the United States&rdquo;. The <!-- PDFPage:1212 -->words &ldquo;these officers&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;among those recommended by such board&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;This does not affect&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;but this shall in no way prejudice&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;to be filled&rdquo;, &ldquo;by it&rdquo;, &ldquo;other&rdquo;, &ldquo;which number shall&rdquo;, &ldquo;to be considered&rdquo;, &ldquo;and may in addition thereto and&rdquo;, and &ldquo;in the position concerned&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.</p>

<p class="note-body">The first sentence is restated to clarify that the Secretary concerned is the Secretary of the Army. The word &ldquo;services&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;work or services&rdquo; because it is inclusive. The word &ldquo;instrumentality&rdquo; is added for clarity.</p>
