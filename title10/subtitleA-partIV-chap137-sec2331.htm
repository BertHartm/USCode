<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establish criteria to ensure that proposals for contracts for technical and professional services are evaluated on a basis which does not encourage contractors to propose uncompensated overtime;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) ensure appropriate emphasis on technical and quality factors in the source selection process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) require identification of any hours in excess of 40-hour weeks included in a proposal;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) provide guidance to contracting officers to ensure that any use of uncompensated overtime will not degrade the level of technical expertise required to perform the contract.</p>
