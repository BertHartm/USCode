<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;a person who has been retired or has become entitled to retired or retainer pay, and who has elected an annuity under this chapter&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;a retired member of a uniformed service who has made the election specified in section 372 of this title&rdquo;, since the revised chapter applies to persons who are receiving retired pay as well as retired members. The word &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;had he been receiving that pay&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;to provide the annuity&rdquo; are inserted for clarity.</p>
