<p class="note-body">Senate and House of Representatives reports on the Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954 state, with reference to section 407 of the Act:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Promotions under this title would include Reserve officers not on active duty but in an active status in the Reserve and Reserve officers on continuous active duty under the Reserve program, but Reserve officers on active duty and on the lineal list would be promoted under other law, as they are at the present time. Officers of the Naval and Marine Corps Reserve selected for promotion under any provision of law would not be penalized by virtue of a change in status with respect to active duty prior to their promotion.&rdquo; (Senate Report No. 2010, July 29, 1954, 83d Congress, 2d Session; House Report No. 1026, July 29, 1953, 83d Congress, 1st Session; both to accompany H.R. 6573).</p>
<p class="note-body">For clarity, the general rule that this chapter does not cover the promotion of lineal list officers is set out in subsection (b), and the exceptions, to protect officers going on or coming off the lineal list shortly before they are due for consideration for promotion or for promotion, are covered in subsections (c), (d), and (e).</p>
<p class="note-body">It should be noted that women officers of the Naval and Marine Corps Reserve (other than women reserve officers in the Nurse Corps and women reserve officers appointed under section 5581 of this title) may not be placed on lineal lists, considered for promotion, or promoted under title III of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 because section 215 of the Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948 made title III of the Officer Personnel Act in applicable to them. These women officers, therefore, whether or not they are on active duty, are considered for promotion and promoted under the provisions of the Reserve Officer Personnel Act of 1954, codified in this chapter. Women officers in these categories may also be promoted (but only if they are on active duty) under the act of July 24, 1941, ch. 320 (55 Stat. 603, as amended; 34 U.S.C. 350&ndash;350k) (codified in section 5787 of this title). The latter act authorizes temporary promotions during war or emergency of regular and reserve officers on active duty.</p>
