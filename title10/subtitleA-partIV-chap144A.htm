<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this chapter, the term &ldquo;major automated information system program&rdquo; means a Department of Defense program for the acquisition of an automated information system (either as a product or a service) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the program is designated by the Secretary of Defense, or a designee of the Secretary, as a major automated information system program; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the dollar value of the program is estimated to exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) $32,000,000 in fiscal year 2000 constant dollars for all program costs in a single fiscal year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) $126,000,000 in fiscal year 2000 constant dollars for all program acquisition costs for the entire program; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) $378,000,000 in fiscal year 2000 constant dollars for the total life-cycle costs of the <!-- PDFPage:1227 -->program (including operation and maintenance costs).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Adjustment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense may adjust the amounts (and base fiscal year) set forth in subsection (a) on the basis of Department of Defense escalation rates. An adjustment under this subsection shall be effective after the Secretary transmits a written notification of the adjustment to the congressional defense committees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Increments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the event any increment of a major automated information system program separately meets the requirements for treatment as a major automated information system program, the provisions of this chapter shall apply to such increment as well as to the overall major automated information system program of which such increment is a part.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Submittal of Cost, Schedule, and Performance Information</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress each calendar year, not later than 45 days after the President submits to Congress the budget for a fiscal year under section 1105 of title 31, budget justification documents regarding cost, schedule, and performance for each major automated information system program for which funds are requested by the President in the budget.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Elements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The documents submitted under subsection (a) with respect to a major automated information system program shall include detailed and summarized information with respect to the automated information system to be acquired under the program, and shall specifically include each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The development schedule, including major milestones.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The implementation schedule, including estimates of milestone dates, initial operational capability, and full operational capability.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Baseline</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) For purposes of this chapter, the initial submittal to Congress of the documents required by subsection (a) with respect to a major automated information system program shall constitute the original estimate or information originally submitted on such program for purposes of the reports and determinations on program changes in section 2445c of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An adjustment or revision of the original estimate or information originally submitted on a program may be treated as the original estimate or information originally submitted on the program if the adjustment or revision is the result of a critical change in the program covered by section 2445c(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the event of an adjustment or revision to the original estimate or information originally submitted on a program under paragraph (2), the Secretary of Defense shall include in the next budget justification documents submitted under subsection (a) after such adjustment or revision a notification to the congressional defense committees of such adjustment or revision, together with the reasons for such adjustment or revision.</p>
