<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Transitional compensation with respect to a member shall be paid for a period of not less than 12 months and not more than 36 months, as established in policies prescribed by the Secretary concerned.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If administrative separation of a member from active duty is proposed on a basis that includes a dependent-abuse offense and the proposed administrative separation is disapproved by competent authority under applicable regulations, payment of transitional compensation in such case shall cease.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) If compensation is paid under this section to a child or children pursuant to subsection (d)(2) or (d)(3), such compensation shall be paid in equal shares, with the amount of such compensation for any month determined in accordance with the rates in effect for that month under section 1313 of title 38.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Spouse and Former Spouse Forfeiture Provisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If a former spouse receiving compensation under this section remarries, the Secretary shall terminate payment of such compensation, effective as of the date of such marriage. The Secretary may not renew payment of compensation under this section to such former spouse in the event of the termination of such subsequent marriage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If after a punitive or other adverse action is executed in the case of a former member as described in subsection (b) the former member resides in the same household as the spouse or former spouse, or dependent child, to whom compensation is otherwise payable under this section, the Secretary shall terminate payment of such compensation, effective as of the time the former member begins residing in such household. Compensation paid for a period after the former member's separation, but before the former member resides in the household, shall not be recouped. If the former member subsequently ceases to reside in such household before the end of the period of eligibility for such payments, the Secretary may not resume such payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In a case in which the victim of the dependent-abuse offense resulting in a punitive or other adverse action described in subsection (b) was a dependent child, the Secretary concerned may not pay compensation under this section to a spouse or former spouse who would otherwise be eligible to receive such compensation if the Secretary determines (under regulations prescribed under subsection (k)) that the spouse or former spouse was an active participant in the conduct constituting the dependent-abuse offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Continuation of Military Pay</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of payment of transitional compensation by reason of a total forfeiture of pay and allowances pursuant to a sentence of a court-martial, payment of transitional compensation shall not be made for any period for which an order&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a dependent or former dependent eligible or entitled to use commissary and exchange stores under paragraph (1) is eligible or entitled <!-- PDFPage:537 -->to use commissary and exchange stores under another provision of law, the eligibility or entitlement of that dependent or former dependent to use commissary and exchange stores shall be determined under such other provision of law rather than under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section with respect to the armed forces (other than the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy).

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) who is 18 years of age or older but less than 23 years of age, is enrolled in a full-time course of study in an institution of higher learning approved by the Secretary of Defense and who is (or, at the time a punitive or other adverse action was executed in the case of the former member as described in subsection (b), was) dependent on the former member for over one-half of the child's support.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(m) <cap-smallcap>Exceptional Eligibility for Dependents of Former Members</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary concerned, under regulations prescribed under subsection (k), may authorize eligibility for benefits under this section for dependents and former dependents of a former member of the armed forces in a case in which the dependents or former dependents are not otherwise eligible for such benefits and the Secretary concerned determines that the former member engaged in conduct that is a dependent-abuse offense under this section and the former member was separated from active duty other than as described in subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In a case in which the Secretary concerned, under the authority of paragraph (1), authorizes benefits to be provided under this section, such benefits shall be provided in the same manner as if the former member were an individual described in subsection (b), except that, under regulations prescribed under subsection (k), the Secretary shall make such adjustments to the commencement and duration of payment provisions of subsection (e), and may make adjustments to other provisions of this section, as the Secretary considers necessary in light of the circumstances in order to provide benefits substantially equivalent to the benefits provided in the case of an individual described in subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The authority of the Secretary concerned under paragraph (1) may not be delegated.</p>
