Upon establishment of such a program, the program shall apply in the case of each such member described in subsection (b) who is under the jurisdiction of the Secretary establishing the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Punitive and Other Adverse Actions Covered</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section applies in the case of a member of the armed forces on active duty for a period of more than 30 days&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a member being considered under applicable regulations for administrative separation from active duty in accordance with such regulations (if the basis for the separation includes a dependent-abuse offense), shall commence as of the date on which the separation action is initiated by a commander of the member pursuant to such regulations, as determined by the Secretary concerned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Transitional compensation with respect to a member shall be paid for a period of 36 months, except that, if as of the date on which payment of transitional compensation commences the unserved portion of the member's period of obligated active duty service is less than 36 months, the period for which transitional compensation is paid shall be equal to the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the unserved portion of the member's period of obligated active duty service; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 12 months.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If a member is sentenced by a court-martial to receive punishment that includes a dismissal, dishonorable discharge, bad conduct discharge, or forfeiture of all pay and allowances as a result of a conviction by a court-martial for a dependent-abuse offense and each such punishment applicable to the member under the sentence is remitted, set aside, or mitigated to a lesser punishment that does not include any such punishment, any payment of transitional compensation that has commenced under this section on the basis of such sentence in that case shall cease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If administrative separation of a member from active duty is proposed on a basis that includes a dependent-abuse offense and the proposed administrative separation is disapproved by competent authority under applicable regulations, payment of transitional compensation in such case shall cease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Cessation of payments under subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be effective as of the first day of the first month following the month in which the Secretary concerned notifies the recipient of such transitional compensation in writing that payment of the transitional compensation will cease. The recipient may not be required to repay amounts of transitional compensation received before that effective date (except to the extent necessary to recoup any amount that was erroneous when paid).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Amount of Payment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Payment to a spouse or former spouse under this section for any month shall be at the rate in effect for that month for the payment of dependency and indemnity compensation under section 1311(a)(1) of title 38.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a spouse or former spouse to whom compensation is paid under this section has custody of a dependent child of the member who resides in the same household as that spouse or former spouse, the amount of such compensation paid for any month shall be increased for each such dependent child by the amount in effect for that month under section 1311(b) of title 38.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If compensation is paid under this section to a child or children pursuant to subsection (d)(2) or (d)(3), such compensation shall be paid in equal shares, with the amount of such compensation for any month determined in accordance with the rates in effect for that month under section 1313 of title 38.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Spouse and Former Spouse Forfeiture Provisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If a former spouse receiving compensation under this section remarries, the Secretary shall terminate payment of such compensation, effective as of the date of such marriage. The Secretary may not renew payment of compensation under this section to such former spouse in the event of the termination of such subsequent marriage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If after a punitive or other adverse action is executed in the case of a former member as described in subsection (b) the former member resides in the same household as the spouse or former spouse, or dependent child, to whom compensation is otherwise payable under this section, the Secretary shall terminate payment of such compensation, effective as of the time the former member begins residing in such household. Compensation paid for a period after the former member's separation, but before the former member resides in the household, shall not be recouped. If the former member subsequently ceases to reside in such household before the end of the period of eligibility for such payments, the Secretary may not resume such payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In a case in which the victim of the dependent-abuse offense resulting in a punitive or other adverse action described in subsection (b) was a dependent child, the Secretary concerned may not pay compensation under this section to a spouse or former spouse who would otherwise be eligible to receive such compensation if the Secretary determines (under regulations prescribed under subsection (k)) that the spouse or former spouse was an active participant in the conduct constituting the dependent-abuse offense.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) suspends, in whole or in part, that part of a sentence that includes forfeiture of the member's pay and allowance; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) otherwise results in continuation, in whole or in part, of the member's pay and allowances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Coordination of Benefits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary concerned may not make payments to a spouse or former spouse under both this section and section 1408(h)(1) of this title. In the case of a spouse or former spouse for whom a court order provides for payments by the Secretary pursuant to section 1408(h)(1) of this title and to whom the Secretary offers payments under this section, the spouse or former spouse shall elect which to receive.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a dependent or former dependent eligible or entitled to use commissary and exchange stores under paragraph (1) is eligible or entitled to use commissary and exchange stores under another provision of law, the eligibility or entitlement of that dependent or former dependent to use commissary and exchange stores shall be determined under such other provision of law rather than under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section with respect to the armed forces (other than the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy).
