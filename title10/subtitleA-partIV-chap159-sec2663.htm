<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Acquisition of Low-Cost Interests in Land</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of a military department may acquire any interest in land that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary determines is needed in the interest of national defense; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of a military department may acquire any interest in land that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) does not cost more than $1,500,000, exclusive of administrative costs and the amounts of any deficiency judgments.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the acquisition is needed in the interest of national defense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the acquisition is required to maintain the operational integrity of a military installation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) considerations of urgency do not permit the delay necessary to include the required acquisition in an annual Military Construction Authorization Act.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 10 days after the date on which the Secretary of a military department determines to acquire an interest in land under the authority of this subsection, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives written notice containing a description of the property and interest to be acquired and the reasons for the acquisition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Appropriations available for military construction may be used for the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Survey Authority; Acquisition Methods</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Authority provided the Secretary of a military department by law to acquire an interest in real property (including a temporary interest) includes authority&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to make surveys; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to acquire the interest in real property by gift, purchase, exchange of real property owned by the United States, or otherwise.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Advance Notice of Use of Condemnation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Before commencing any legal proceeding to acquire any interest in land under subsection (a), including acquisition for temporary use, by condemnation, eminent domain, or seizure, the Secretary of the military department concerned shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) pursue, to the maximum extent practicable, all other available options for the acquisition or use of the land, such as the purchase of an easement or the execution of a land exchange; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) submit to the congressional defense committees a report containing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a description of the land to be acquired;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a certification that negotiations with the owner or owners of the land occurred, and that the Secretary tendered consideration in an amount equal to the fair market value of the land, as determined by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) an explanation of the other approaches considered for acquiring use of the land, the reasons for the acquisition of the land, and the reasons why alternative acquisition strategies are inadequate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary concerned may have proceedings brought in the name of the United States to acquire the land after the end of the 21-day period beginning on the date on which the report is received by the committees or, if over sooner, the end of the 14-day period beginning on the date on which a copy of the report is provided in an electronic medium pursuant to section 480 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Exception to Advance Notice Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary of a military department determines that the use of condemnation, eminent domain, or seizure to acquire an interest in land is required under subsection (a) to satisfy a requirement vital to national security, and that any delay would be detrimental to national security or the protection of health, safety, or the environment, the Secretary may have proceedings brought in the name of the United States to acquire the land in advance of submitting the report required by subsection (f)(1)(B). However, the Secretary shall submit the report not later than seven days after commencement of the legal proceedings with respect to the land.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1958 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">The deletion of the last sentence of section 2663(a) and the last sentence of section 2664(a) reflects their implied repeal by Rule 71A of the Rules of Civil Procedure for the United States District Courts (see 28 U.S.C. 2072). (See letter from Assistant Attorney General (Lands Division), Department of Justice, August 1957, to General Counsel, Department of Defense.) The other changes conform section 2664 to section 2663, both of which were based on the same source statute (sec. 8 of the Act of July 9, 1918, ch. 143, subch. XV, 40 Stat. 888) and both of which include the temporary use of the kinds of property respectively covered.</p>
