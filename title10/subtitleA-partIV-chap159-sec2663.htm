<h4 class="note-head">1958 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">The deletion of the last sentence of section 2663(a) and the last sentence of section 2664(a) reflects their implied repeal by Rule 71A of the Rules of Civil Procedure for the United States District Courts (see 28 U.S.C. 2072). (See letter from Assistant Attorney General (Lands Division), Department of Justice, August 1957, to General Counsel, Department of Defense.) The other changes conform section 2664 to section 2663, both of which were based on the same source statute (sec. 8 of the Act of July 9, 1918, ch. 143, subch. XV, 40 Stat. 888) and both of which include the temporary use of the kinds of property respectively covered.</p>
