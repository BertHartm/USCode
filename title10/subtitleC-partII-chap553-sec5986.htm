<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;To promote&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;For the purposes of promoting&rdquo; for brevity and the words &ldquo;among the young men of the United States&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;naval engineering&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;steam engineering&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;naval architecture&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;iron-ship building&rdquo; to conform to current terminology and to express more clearly the intent of the statute. The words &ldquo;the Territories, Commonwealths, or possessions&rdquo; are inserted, since the words &ldquo;United States&rdquo; in the source statute are considered to have included all areas under the United States flag.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 1 of the Act of March 3, 1899, ch. 413, 30 Stat. 1004, transferred officers of the Engineer Corps of the Navy to the line of the Navy; therefore, in subsection (a) the words &ldquo;qualified officer&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;engineer officer&rdquo; to preserve the meaning of the section and to include any officer possessing adequate background and training in engineering duties.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the word &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;rules&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;public service&rdquo; to conform to current terminology.</p>
