<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;all property named in subsection (b), and all services&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;for supplies or services&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;(each being hereinafter called the agency)&rdquo;, are omitted, since the revised sections of this chapter make specific reference to the agencies named in this revised section. The words &ldquo;United States&rdquo; before the words &ldquo;Coast Guard&rdquo; are omitted, since they are not a part of the official name of the Coast Guard under section 1 of title 14.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the introductory clause is substituted for the word &ldquo;supplies&rdquo;. Throughout the revised chapter reference is made to &ldquo;property or services covered by this chapter&rdquo;, instead of &ldquo;supplies&rdquo;, since the word &ldquo;supplies&rdquo; is defined in section 101(26) of this title in its usual and narrower sense, rather than the sense of the source statute for this revised chapter. It is desirable to avoid a usage which conflicts with the definition in section 101(26) of this title. The word &ldquo;ships&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;of every character, type, and description&rdquo;, after the word &ldquo;vessels&rdquo;, are omitted as covered by the definition of &ldquo;vessel&rdquo; in section 1 of title 1.</p>
