<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Competitive Procedures and Advance Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To attain the goal of subsection (a):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) The head of the agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) ensure that substantial progress is made in increasing awards of agency contracts to entities described in subsection (a)(1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) exercise his utmost authority, resourcefulness, and diligence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) in the case of the Department of Defense, actively monitor and assess the progress of the military departments, Defense Agencies, and prime contractors of the Department of Defense in attaining such goal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) in the case of the Coast Guard and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, actively monitor and assess the progress of the prime contractors of the agency in attaining such goal.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To the extent practicable and when necessary to facilitate achievement of the 5 percent goal described in subsection (a), the head of an agency shall make advance payments under section 2307 of this title to contractors described in subsection (a).

The head of an agency shall adjust the percentage specified in the preceding sentence for any industry category if available information clearly indicates that nondisadvantaged small business concerns in such industry category are generally being denied a reasonable opportunity to compete for contracts because of the use of that percentage in the application of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) The Secretary of Defense may not exercise the authority under subparagraph (A) to enter into a contract for a price exceeding fair market cost if the regulations implementing that authority are suspended under clause (ii) with respect to that contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall determine, on the basis of the most recent data, whether the Department of Defense achieved the 5 percent goal described in subsection (a) during the fiscal year to which the data relates. Upon determining that the Department achieved the goal for the fiscal year to which the data relates, the Secretary shall issue a suspension, in writing, of the regulations that implement the authority under subparagraph (A). Such a suspension shall be in effect for the one-year period beginning 30 days after the date on which the suspension is issued and shall apply with respect to contracts awarded pursuant to solicitations issued during that period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) For purposes of clause (ii), the term &ldquo;most recent data&rdquo; means data relating to the most recent fiscal year for which data are available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To the extent practicable, the head of an agency shall maximize the number of minority small business concerns, historically Black colleges and universities, and minority institutions participating in the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Each head of an agency shall prescribe regulations which provide for the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Guidance to agency personnel on the relationship among the following programs:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The program implementing this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) The program established under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) The small business set-aside program established under section 15(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(a)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) With respect to an agency procurement which is reasonably likely to be set aside for entities described in subsection (a)(1), a requirement that (to the maximum extent practicable) the procurement be designated as such a set-aside before the solicitation for the procurement is issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Policies and procedures which, to the maximum extent practicable, will ensure that current levels in the number or dollar value of contracts awarded under the program established under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)) and under the small business set-aside program established under section 15(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(a)) are maintained and that every effort is made to provide new opportunities for contract awards to eligible entities, in order to meet the goal of subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Implementation of this section in a manner which will not alter the procurement process under the program established under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) A requirement that one factor used in evaluating the performance of a contracting officer be the ability of the officer to increase contract awards to entities described in subsection (a)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) Increased technical assistance to entities described in subsection (a)(1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Penalties and Regulations Relating to Status</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Whoever for the purpose of securing a contract or subcontract under subsection (a) misrepresents the status of any concern or person as a small business concern owned and controlled by a minority (as described in subsection (a)) or as a qualified HUBZone small business concern (as defined in section 3(p) of the Small Business Act), shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than one year, or a fine under title 18, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall prohibit awarding a contract under this section to an entity described in subsection (a)(1) unless the entity agrees to comply with the requirements of section 15(<em>o</em>)(1) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(<em>o</em>)(1)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Industry Categories</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the head of the agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ensure that no particular industry category bears a disproportionate share of the contracts awarded to attain the goal established by subsection (a); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) ensure that contracts awarded to attain the goal established by subsection (a) are made across the broadest possible range of industry categories.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under procedures prescribed by the head of the agency, a person may request the Secretary to determine whether the use of small disadvantaged business set asides by a contracting activity of the agency has caused a particular industry category to bear a disproportionate share of the contracts awarded to attain the goal established for that contracting activity for the purposes of this section. Upon making a determination that a particular industry category is bearing a disproportionate share, the head of the agency shall take appropriate actions to limit the contracting activity's use of set asides in awarding contracts in that particular industry category.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Compliance With Subcontracting Plan Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall contain regulations to ensure that potential contractors submitting sealed bids or competitive proposals to the agency for procurement contracts to be awarded under the program provided for by this section are complying with applicable subcontracting plan requirements of section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The regulations required by paragraph (1) shall ensure that, with respect to a sealed bid or competitive proposal for which the bidder or offeror is required to negotiate or submit a subcontracting plan under section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)), the subcontracting plan shall be a factor in evaluating the bid or proposal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Annual Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than December 15 of each year, the head of the agency shall submit to Congress a report on the progress of the agency toward attaining the goal of subsection (a) during the preceding fiscal year.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section:</p>
