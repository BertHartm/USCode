<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe&rdquo; are omitted, since the President has inherent authority to issue regulations appropriate to exercising his functions. The words &ldquo;but not in the name of Congress&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage, since a medal is presented in the name of Congress only if the law so directs. The word &ldquo;award&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;present&rdquo; to cover the determination of the recipients as well as the actual presentation of the medal. The words &ldquo;since the 6th day of April, 1917, has distinguished, or who, after July 2, 1926&rdquo; and 10:1429 (proviso of 1st sentence) are omitted as executed.</p>
