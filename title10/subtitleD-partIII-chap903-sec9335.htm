<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Dean of the Faculty is responsible to the Superintendent for developing and sustaining the curriculum and overseeing the faculty of the Academy. The qualifications, selection procedures, training, pay grade, and retention of the Dean shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the Air Force, except that a person may not be appointed or assigned as Dean unless that person holds the highest academic degree in that person's academic field. If a person appointed as the Dean is not an officer on active duty, the person shall be appointed as a member of the Senior Executive Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) While serving as Dean of the Faculty, an officer on active duty who holds a grade lower than brigadier general (or the equivalent) shall hold the grade of brigadier general (or the equivalent), if appointed to that grade by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The retirement age of an officer so appointed is that of a permanent professor of the Academy. An officer so appointed is counted for purposes of the applicable limitation in section 526(a) of this title on general officers on active duty.</p>
