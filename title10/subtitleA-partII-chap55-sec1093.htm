<h4 class="note-head">Privately Funded Abortions at Military Hospitals</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of the President of the United States, Jan. 22, 1993, 58 F.R. 6439, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 1093 of title 10 of the United States Code prohibits the use of Department of Defense (&ldquo;DOD&rdquo;) funds to perform abortions except where the life of a woman would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term. By memoranda of December 21, 1987, and June 21, 1988, DOD has gone beyond what I am informed are the requirements of the statute and has banned all abortions at U.S. military facilities, even where the procedure is privately funded. This ban is unwarranted. Accordingly, I hereby direct that you reverse the ban immediately and permit abortion services to be provided, if paid for entirely with non-DOD funds and in accordance with other relevant DOD policies and procedures.</p>
<p class="note-body">You are hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="presidential-signature">William J. Clinton.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
