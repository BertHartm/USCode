The word &ldquo;extensive&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;extended&rdquo;, except where it refers to &ldquo;extended&rdquo; active duty, in which case the word &ldquo;extended&rdquo; is omitted as surplusage.

The words &ldquo;these officers&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;among those recommended by such board&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;This does not affect&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;but this shall in no way prejudice&rdquo;.
