<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Use of Renewable Forms of Energy Encouraged</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall encourage the use of energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy as a source of energy for military construction projects (including military family housing projects) where use of such form of energy is consistent with the energy performance goals and energy performance plan for the Department of Defense developed under section 2911 of this title and supported by the special considerations specified in subsection (c) of such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Consideration During Design Phase of Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary concerned shall require that the design of all new facilities (including family housing) shall include consideration of energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary concerned shall require that contracts for construction resulting from such design include a requirement that energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy be installed if such systems can be shown to be cost effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Determination of Cost Effectiveness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) For the purposes of this section, an energy system using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy for a facility shall be considered to be cost effective if the difference between (A) the original investment cost of the energy system for the facility with such a system, and (B) the original investment cost of the energy system for the facility without such a system can be recovered over the expected life of the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A determination under paragraph (1) concerning whether a cost-differential can be recovered over the expected life of a facility shall be made using the life-cycle cost methods and procedures established pursuant to section 544(a) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8254(a)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Exception to Square Feet and Cost Per Square Foot Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In order to equip a military construction project (including a military family housing project) with heating equipment, cooling equipment, or both heating and cooling equipment using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy or with a passive energy system using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy, the Secretary concerned may authorize an increase in any otherwise applicable limitation with respect to the number of square feet or the cost per square foot of the project by such amount as may be necessary for such purpose. Any such increase under this subsection shall be in addition to any other administrative increase in cost per square foot or variation in floor area authorized by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Use of Energy Efficiency Products in New Construction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that energy efficient products meeting the requirements of the Department of Defense are used in new facility construction by or for the Department carried out under chapter 169 of this title if such products are readily available and their use is consistent with the energy performance goals and energy performance plan for the Department developed under section 2911 of this title and supported by the special considerations specified in subsection (c) of such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the energy efficiency of products, the Secretary shall consider products that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) meet or exceed Energy Star specifications; or</p>
