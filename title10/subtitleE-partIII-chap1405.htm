<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Establishment of Zone</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before convening a mandatory promotion board under section 14101(a) of this title, the Secretary of the military department concerned shall establish a promotion zone for officers serving in each grade and competitive category to be considered by the board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Number in the Zone</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary concerned shall determine the number of officers in the promotion zone for officers serving in any grade and competitive category from among officers who are eligible for promotion in that grade and competitive category under the provisions of sections 14303 and 14304 of this title and who are otherwise eligible for promotion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Factors in Determining Number in the Zone</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary's determination under subsection (b) shall be made on the basis of an estimate of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The number of officers needed in that competitive category in the next higher grade in each of the next five years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In the case of a promotion zone for officers to be promoted to a grade to which the maximum years of in grade criteria established in section 14304 of this title apply, the number of officers in that competitive category who are required to be considered for selection for promotion to the next higher grade under that section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The number of officers that should be placed in the promotion zone in each of the next five years to provide to officers in those years relatively similar opportunities for promotion.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Determination of Maximum Number</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before convening a promotion board under section 14101(a) of this title for a grade and competitive category (other than a vacancy promotion board), the Secretary of the military department concerned, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, shall determine the maximum number of officers in that grade and competitive category that the board may recommend for promotion. The Secretary shall make the determination under the preceding sentence of the maximum number that may be recommended with a view to having on the reserve active-status list a sufficient number of officers in each grade and competitive category to meet the needs of the armed force concerned for <!-- PDFPage:1568 -->officers on that list. In order to make that determination, the Secretary shall determine (1) the number of positions needed to accomplish mission objectives which require officers of such competitive category in the grade to which the board will recommend officers for promotion, (2) the estimated number of officers needed to fill vacancies in such positions during the period in which it is anticipated that officers selected for promotion will be promoted, (3) the number of officers authorized by the Secretary of the military department concerned to serve on the reserve active-status list in the grade and competitive category under consideration, and (4) any statutory limitation on the number of officers in any grade or category (or combination thereof) authorized to be on the reserve active-status list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Below-the-Zone Selections</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of the military department concerned may, when the needs of the armed force concerned require, authorize the consideration of officers in the grade of captain, major, or lieutenant colonel on the reserve active-status list of the Army or Air Force, in a grade above first lieutenant on the reserve active-status list of the Marine Corps, or in a grade above lieutenant (junior grade) on the reserve active-status list of the Navy, for promotion to the next higher grade from below the promotion zone.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When selection from below the promotion zone is authorized, the Secretary shall establish the number of officers that may be recommended for promotion from below the promotion zone in each competitive category to be considered. That number may not exceed the number equal to 10 percent of the maximum number of officers that the board is authorized to recommend for promotion in such competitive category, except that the Secretary of Defense may authorize a greater number, not to exceed 15 percent of the total number of officers that the board is authorized to recommend for promotion, if the Secretary of Defense determines that the needs of the armed force concerned so require. If the maximum number determined under this paragraph is less than one, the board may recommend one officer for promotion from below the promotion zone.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The number of officers recommended for promotion from below the promotion zone does not increase the maximum number of officers that the board is authorized to recommend for promotion under subsection (a).</p>

If the Secretary concerned later determines that the officer is qualified for promotion to the higher grade, the officer shall be retained on the promotion list, the list of officers found qualified for Federal recognition, or list of officers nominated by the President to the Senate for appointment in a higher reserve grade, and shall, upon promotion to that grade, have the same date of rank, the same effective date for pay and allowances of that grade, and the same position on the reserve active-status list as the officer would have had if no delay had intervened, unless the Secretary concerned determines that the officer was unqualified for promotion for any part of the delay. If the Secretary makes such a determination, the Secretary may adjust such date of rank, effective date of pay and allowances, and position on the reserve active-status list as the Secretary considers appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Notice to Officer</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The appointment of an officer to a higher grade may not be delayed under subsection (a) or (b) unless the officer is given written notice of the grounds for the delay. The preceding sentence does not apply if it is impracticable to give the officer written notice before the date on which the appointment to the higher grade would otherwise take effect, but in such a case the written notice shall be given as soon as practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An officer whose promotion is delayed under subsection (a) or (b) shall be given an opportunity to make a written statement to the Secretary of the military department concerned in response to the action taken. The Secretary shall give consideration to any such statement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Length of Delay in Promotion</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The appointment of an officer to a higher grade may not be delayed under subsection (a) or (b) for more than six months after the date on which the officer would otherwise have been promoted unless the Secretary concerned specifies a further period of delay. An officer's appointment may not be delayed more than 90 days after final action has been taken in any criminal case against the officer in a Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction or more than 90 days after final action has been taken in any court-martial case against the officer. Except for court action, a promotion may not be delayed more than 18 months after the date on which the officer would otherwise have been promoted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Delay Because of Limitations on Officer Strength in Grade or Duties to Which Assigned</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, the promotion of a reserve officer on the reserve active-status list who is serving on active duty, or who is on full-time National Guard duty for administration of the reserves or the National Guard, to a grade to which the strength limitations of section 12011 of this title apply shall be delayed if necessary to ensure compliance with those strength limitations. The delay shall expire when the Secretary determines that the delay is no longer required to ensure such compliance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The promotion of an officer described in paragraph (1) shall also be delayed while the officer is on duty described in that paragraph unless the Secretary of the military department concerned, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, determines that the duty assignment of the officer requires a higher grade than the grade currently held by the officer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The date of rank and position on the reserve active-status list of a reserve officer whose promotion to or Federal recognition in the next higher grade was delayed under paragraph (1) or (2) solely as the result of the limitations imposed under the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense or contained in section 12011 of this title shall be the date on which the officer would have been promoted to or recognized in the higher grade had such limitations not existed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If an officer whose promotion is delayed under paragraph (1) or (2) completes the period of active duty or full-time National Guard duty that the officer is required by law or regulation to perform as a member of a reserve component, the officer may request release from active duty or full-time National Guard duty. If the request is granted, the officer's promotion shall be effective upon the officer's release from such duty. The date of rank and position on the reserve active-status list of the officer shall be the date the officer would have been promoted to or recognized in the higher grade had the limitations imposed under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense contained in section 12011 of this title not existed. If an officer whose promotion is delayed under paragraph (1) or (2) has <!-- PDFPage:1571 -->not completed the period of active duty or full-time National Guard duty that the officer is required by law or regulation to perform as a member of a reserve component, the officer may be retained on active duty or on full-time National Guard duty in the grade in which the officer was serving before the officer's being found qualified for Federal recognition or the officer's selection for the promotion until the officer completes that required period of duty.</p>
