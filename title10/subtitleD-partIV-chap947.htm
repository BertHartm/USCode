<p class="note-body">Before the enactment of the National Security Act of 1947, the transport functions covered by this section were performed only by the Army. Under Transfer Order 26, 15 Oct. 1948, JAAF Bull. 42, 1948; JAAFAR 4&ndash;55&ndash;1, par. 2a(1)(f), 29 Oct. 1948; AR 96&ndash;15, AFR 76&ndash;7, 5 June 1951; AR 96&ndash;20, AFR 76&ndash;6, 11 June 1953, these transport functions also became the responsibility of the Secretary of the Air Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under section 2(a)(3) of the National Security Act (as it existed before August 10, 1949), the sea transportation functions of the Army and Navy, and the air transportation functions of the Army, Navy, and Air Force were respectively consolidated into the &ldquo;Military Sea Transportation Service&rdquo;, under the Department of the Navy, and the &ldquo;Military Air Transport Service&rdquo;, under the Department of the Air Force. Instead of having space on transport vessels and airplanes operated by it for its sole use, the Air Force is allotted bulk space on vessels and airplanes operated by military transport agencies operating for the benefit of the Department of Defense as a whole. The words &ldquo;or, within bulk space allocations made to the Department of the Air Force, on vessels or airplanes operated by any military transport agency of the Department of Defense&rdquo; are inserted, in accordance with an opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1953/5885, 22 July 1953), concurred in by the Judge Advocate General of the Air Force, to make clear that the rule applicable to vessels and airplanes applies to the bulk space allocated to the Air Force. Since the authority to perform transportation functions could again be transferred as between the military departments, the references to airplanes of Air Force transport agencies (as distinct from bulk space allocations thereon) is retained.</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;considers&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;in the opinion of&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;Persons residing in Alaska who are and have been employed there by the United States&rdquo;, are substituted for the words &ldquo;employees of the United States, residing in Alaska, who have been in such employment&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;civil&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;from and after November 21, 1941&rdquo;, &ldquo;and the carriage of all such air traffic shall be terminated&rdquo;, &ldquo;dire&rdquo;, &ldquo;the privilege herein granted&rdquo;, and &ldquo;as to each eligible individual&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;the continental&rdquo; are omitted, since section 101(1) of this title defines the United States as &ldquo;the States and the District of Columbia&rdquo;.</p>
