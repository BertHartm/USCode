<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;if not otherwise retired pursuant to law&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c) the pay provisions are worded so as to conform to the terminology of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.).</p>
<p class="note-body">The second proviso in &sect;312(g) of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 (34 U.S.C. 410j(g)), relating to the retired pay of officers commissioned in the Regular Navy under the Act of April 18, 1946, ch. 141, as amended (34 U.S.C. 15), and officers commissioned in the Regular Navy while serving on active duty as officers of the Naval Reserve, is not codified in this section because it is inapplicable to officers designated for limited duty. The only authority to appoint limited duty officers is &sect;404(a) of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 (34 U.S.C. 211c(a)). Naval Reserve officers are not eligible for such appointments. Hence there can be no limited duty officers in the categories mentioned in the proviso.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f) the words &ldquo;to which he would otherwise become entitled&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage and the words &ldquo;based on the service for which he has received payment&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;attributable to the active service in respect of which lump-sum payment shall have been made to him&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second proviso in &sect;312(f) of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 (34 U.S.C. 410j(f)), which provides that officers who exercise their option to revert to a warrant officer grade shall be retired upon completing 30 years of active naval service, is omitted as superseded by &sect;14(b)(2) of the Warrant Officer Act of 1954 (34 U.S.C. 430(b)(2)), codified in &sect;1305 of this title.</p>
