App. 2405(j)(1)(A)) has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a foreign government owns or controls (whether directly or indirectly) a significant interest in such firm or subsidiary (or, in the case of a subsidiary, in the firm that owns the subsidiary); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such foreign government is the government of a country that the Secretary of State determines under section 6(j)(1)(A) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)(1)(A)) has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Waiver</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) If the Secretary of Defense determines under paragraph (2) that entering into a contract with a firm or a subsidiary of a firm described in subsection (b) is not inconsistent with the national security objectives of the United States, the head of an agency may enter into a contract with such firm or subsidiary after the date on which such head of an agency submits to Congress a report on the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A report under subparagraph (A) shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The identity of the foreign government concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The nature of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The extent of ownership or control of the firm or subsidiary concerned (or, if appropriate in the case of a subsidiary, of the firm that owns the subsidiary) by the foreign government concerned or the agency or instrumentality of such foreign government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) The reasons for entering into the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) After the head of an agency submits a report to Congress under subparagraph (A) with respect to a firm or a subsidiary, such head of an agency is not required to submit a report before entering into any subsequent contract with such firm or subsidiary unless the information required to be included in such report under subparagraph (B) has materially changed since the submission of the previous report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon the request of the head of an agency, the Secretary of Defense shall determine whether entering into a contract with a firm or subsidiary described in subsection (b) is inconsistent with the national security objectives of the United States. In making such a determination, the Secretary of Defense shall consider the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The relationship of the United States with the foreign government concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The obligations of the United States under international agreements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The extent of the ownership or control of the firm or subsidiary (or, if appropriate in the case of a subsidiary, of the firm that owns the subsidiary) by the foreign government or an agent or instrumentality of the foreign government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Whether payments made, or information made available, to the firm or subsidiary under the contract could be used for purposes hostile to the interests of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A person may request the Secretary to include on the list maintained under paragraph (1) any firm or subsidiary of a firm that the person believes to be owned or controlled by a foreign government described in subsection (b)(2). Upon receipt of such a request, the Secretary shall determine whether the conditions in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b) exist in the case of that firm or subsidiary. If the Secretary determines that such conditions do exist, the Secretary shall include the firm or subsidiary on the list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A firm or subsidiary of a firm included on the list may request the Secretary to remove such firm or subsidiary from the list on the basis that it has been erroneously included on the list or its ownership circumstances have significantly changed. Upon receipt of such a request, the Secretary shall determine whether the conditions in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b) exist in the case of that firm or subsidiary. If the Secretary determines that such conditions do not exist, the Secretary shall remove the firm or subsidiary from the list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall establish procedures to carry out this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The head of an agency shall prohibit each firm or subsidiary of a firm awarded a contract by the agency from entering into a subcontract under that contract in an amount in excess of $25,000 with a firm or subsidiary included on the list maintained under paragraph (1) unless there is a compelling reason to do so. In the case of any subcontract requiring consent by the head of an agency, the head of the agency shall not consent to the award of the subcontract to a firm or subsidiary included on such list unless there is a compelling reason for such approval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Distribution of List</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of General Services shall ensure that the list de<!-- PDFPage:918 -->veloped and maintained under subsection (d) is made available to Federal agencies and the public in the same manner and to the same extent as the list of suspended and debarred contractors compiled pursuant to subpart 9.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
