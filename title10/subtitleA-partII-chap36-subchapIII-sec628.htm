<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Persons Not Considered by Promotion Boards Due to Administrative Error</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Secretary of the military department concerned determines that because of administrative error a person who should have been considered for selection for promotion by a promotion board was not so considered, the Secretary shall convene a special selection board under this subsection to determine whether that person (whether or not then on active duty) should be recommended for promotion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A special selection board convened under paragraph (1) shall consider the record of the person whose name was referred to it for consideration as that record would have appeared to the board that should have considered him. That record shall be compared with a sampling of the records of those officers of the same competitive category who were recommended for promotion, and those officers who were not recommended for promotion, by the board that should have considered him.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a special selection board convened under paragraph (1) does not recommend for promotion a person whose name was referred to it for consideration for selection for appointment to a grade other than a general officer or flag officer grade, the person shall be considered to have failed of selection for promotion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Persons Considered by Promotion Boards in Unfair Manner</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Secretary of the military department concerned determines, in the case of a person who was considered for selection for promotion by a promotion board but was not selected, that there was material unfairness with respect to that person, the Secretary may convene a special selection board under this subsection to determine whether that person (whether or not then on active duty) should be recommended for promotion. In order to determine that there was material unfairness, the Secretary must determine that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the action of the promotion board that considered the person was contrary to law or involved material error of fact or material administrative error; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the board did not have before it for its consideration material information.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A special selection board convened under paragraph (1) shall consider the record of the person whose name was referred to it for consideration as that record, if corrected, would have appeared to the board that considered him. That record shall be compared with the records of a sampling of those officers of the same competitive category who were recommended for promotion, and those officers who were not recommended for promotion, by the board that considered him.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a special selection board convened under paragraph (1) does not recommend for promotion a person whose name was referred to it for consideration, the person incurs no additional failure of selection for promotion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Reports of Boards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Each special selection board convened under this section shall submit to the Secretary of the military department concerned a written report, signed by each member of the board, containing the name of each person it recommends for promotion and certifying that the board has carefully considered the record of each person whose name was referred to it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of sections 617(b) and 618 of this title apply to the report and proceedings of a special selection board convened under this section in the same manner as they apply to the report and proceedings of a selection board convened under section 611(a) of this title. However, in the case of a board convened under this section to consider a warrant officer or former warrant officer, the provisions of sections 576(d) and 576(f) of this title (rather than the provisions of sections 617(b) and 618 of this title) apply to the report and proceedings of the board in the same manner as they apply to the report and proceedings of a selection board convened under section 573 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Appointment of Persons Selected by Boards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the report of a special selection board convened under this section, as approved by the President, recommends for promotion to the next higher grade a person whose name was referred to it for consideration, that person shall, as soon as practicable, be appointed to that grade in accordance with subsections (b), (c), and (d) of section 624 of this title. However, in the case of a board convened under this section to consider a warrant officer or former warrant officer, if the report of that board, as approved by the Secretary concerned, recommends that warrant officer or former warrant officer <!-- PDFPage:246 -->for promotion to the next higher grade, that person shall, as soon as practicable, be appointed to the next higher grade in accordance with provisions of section 578(c) of this title (rather than subsections (b), (c), and (d) of section 624 of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person who is appointed to the next higher grade as the result of the recommendation of a special selection board convened under this section shall, upon that appointment, have the same date of rank, the same effective date for the pay and allowances of that grade, and the same position on the active-duty list as he would have had if he had been recommended for promotion to that grade by the board which should have considered, or which did consider, him. In the case of a person who is not on the active-duty list when appointed to the next higher grade, placement of that person on the active-duty list pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be only for purposes of determination of eligibility of that person for consideration for promotion by any subsequent special selection board under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Deceased Persons</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a person whose name is being considered for referral to a special selection board under this section dies before the completion of proceedings under this section with respect to that person, this section shall be applied to that person posthumously.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Convening of Boards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A board convened under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall be convened under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall be composed in accordance with section 612 of this title or, in the case of board to consider a warrant officer or former warrant officer, in accordance with section 573 of this title and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the military department concerned; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall be subject to the provisions of section 613 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Promotion Board Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;promotion board&rdquo; means a selection board convened by the Secretary of a military department under section 573(a) or 611(a) of this title.</p>
