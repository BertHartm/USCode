<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) His surviving spouse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) His children, as prescribed by subsection (b), in equal shares.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If designated by him, any one or more of the following persons:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) His parents or persons in loco parentis, as prescribed by subsection (c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) His brothers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) His sisters.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) His parents or persons in loco parentis, as prescribed by subsection (c), in equal shares.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) His brothers and sisters in equal shares.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Clauses (3) and (5) of this subsection include brothers and sisters of the half blood and those through adoption.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Subsection (a)(2) applies, without regard to age or marital status, to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) legitimate children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) adopted children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) stepchildren who were a part of the decedent's household at the time of his death;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) illegitimate children of a female decedent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) illegitimate children of a male decedent&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) who have been judicially determined, before the decedent's death, to be his children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) who have been otherwise proved, by evidence satisfactory to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, to be children of the decedent; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Clauses (3) and (4) of subsection (a), so far as they apply to parents and persons in loco parentis, include fathers and mothers through adoption, and persons who stood in loco parentis to the decedent for a period of not less than one year at any time before he acquired a status described in section 1475 or 1476 of this title. However, only one father and one mother, or their counterparts in loco parentis, may be recognized <!-- PDFPage:786 -->in any case, and preference shall be given to those who exercised a parental relationship on the date, or most nearly before the date, on which the decedent entered that status.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) During the period beginning on the date of the enactment of this subsection and ending on September 30, 2007, a person covered by section 1475 or 1476 of this title may designate another person to receive not more than 50 percent of the amount payable under section 1478 of this title. The designation shall indicate the percentage of the amount, to be specified only in 10 percent increments up to the maximum of 50 percent, that the designated person may receive. The balance of the amount of the death gratuity shall be paid to or for the living survivors of the person concerned in accordance with paragraphs (1) through (5) of subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If a person entitled to all or a portion of a death gratuity under subsection (a) or (d) dies before the person receives the death gratuity, it shall be paid to the living survivor next in the order prescribed by subsection (a).</p>
