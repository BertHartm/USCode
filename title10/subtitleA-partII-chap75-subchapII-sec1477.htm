<p class="statutory-body-block">Clauses (3) and (5) of this subsection include brothers and sisters of the half blood and those through adoption.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Subsection (a)(2) applies, without regard to age or marital status, to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) legitimate children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) adopted children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) stepchildren who were a part of the decedent's household at the time of his death;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) illegitimate children of a female decedent; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) If an eligible survivor dies before he receives the death gratuity, it shall be paid to the living survivor next in the order prescribed by subsection (a).</p>
