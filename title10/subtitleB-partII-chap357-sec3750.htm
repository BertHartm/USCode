<p class="statutory-body">(a) The President may award a decoration called the &ldquo;Soldier's Medal&rdquo;, of appropriate design with accompanying ribbon, to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the Army, distinguishes himself by heroism not involving actual conflict with an enemy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Not more than one Soldier's Medal may be awarded to a person. However, for each succeeding act that would otherwise justify the award of such a medal, the President may award a suitable bar or other device to be worn as he directs.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;Under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe&rdquo; are omitted, since the President has inherent authority to issue regulations appropriate to exercising his functions. The words &ldquo;but not in the name of Congress&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage, since a medal is presented in the name of Congress only if the law so directs. The word &ldquo;award&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;present&rdquo; to cover the determination of the recipients as well as the actual presentation of the medal. The words &ldquo;a decoration called&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;a medal to be known as&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;including the National Guard and the Organized Reserves&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;or herself&rdquo; are omitted, since under section 1 of title 1, words importing the masculine gender include the feminine. The words &ldquo;after July 2, 1926&rdquo; are omitted as executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;that would otherwise justify&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;sufficient to&rdquo;.</p>
