<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) consolidates the provisions of 10:1036a and 1036e(b)&ndash;(d), and 34:440i and 440m(b)&ndash;(d), relating to service that may be counted in determining eligibility for retired pay under this chapter. 10:1036e(a) and 34:440m(a) are omitted as covered by the enumeration of the service that may be counted for the purposes of the revised section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1)(A)&ndash;(F), the requirement that the service must have been satisfactory is omitted as executed, since all service before July 1, 1949, has been found to have been satisfactory by the Secretaries concerned.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1)(A), the words &ldquo;the armed forces&rdquo; are substituted for clauses (1), (2), (5)&ndash;(7), (9), (10), and (13)&ndash;(16), of 10:1036e(c) and 34:440m(c), and so much of clause (8) of 10:1036e(c) and 34:440m(c) as relates to the Naval Reserve and the Naval Reserve Force as constituted after February 28, 1925, since the service covered by those clauses when added to service in the regular components, comprises all service in the armed forces.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1)(B)&ndash;(C), the words &ldquo;June 15&rdquo; are inserted to reflect the exact date of the change in National Guard status made by section 5 of the Act of June 15, 1933, ch. 87, 48 Stat. 155, which established the National Guard of the United States as a reserve component of the Army.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1)(D), 10:1036e(c)(8) (last 25 words), 10:1036e(c)(9) (last 22 words), 34:440m(c)(8) (last 25 words), and 34:440m(c)(9) (last 22 words) are omitted as covered by subsection (b)(5).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2)(A), the words &ldquo;service that conformed to required standards and qualifications&rdquo; are <!-- PDFPage:1548 -->substituted for 10:1036e(b) and 34:440m(b). In clause (a)(2)(A), 10:1036e(d) and 34:440m(d), which make it clear that &ldquo;active Federal service&rdquo;, in the sense in which that term is used in 10:1036a&ndash;e and 34:440i&ndash;m, includes annual training duty and attendance at service schools, are omitted as covered by sections 101(22) and 101(24) of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2)(A) and (B), specific reference is made to National Guard service to reflect the opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA, 1956/1908, 13 Feb. 1956).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2)(C), the words &ldquo;other than active Federal service&rdquo; are omitted, since the points for membership are not reduced by active duty (see opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA, 1953/2016, 3 Mar. 1953)).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (a) and (b), the words &ldquo;active service&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;active Federal service&rdquo; for uniformity of expression. In clause (5), the words &ldquo;transferred thereto after completion of 16 or more years of active naval service&rdquo; are omitted, since other authorized fleet reserve categories have not been used and authority for them is omitted from this revised title as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b)(1)&ndash;(4) is inserted because of 10:1036e(e) and (f) and 34:440m(e) and (f), which state that the service enumerated in those clauses may not be considered in determining eligibility for retired pay under this chapter. Clause (5) is based on the exclusions in 34:440m(c)(8)&ndash;(9).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b)(6) is inserted for clarity since 10:1036a and 34:440i were limited in applicability to service in the status of a &ldquo;commissioned officer, warrant officer, flight officer, or enlisted person.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- field-end:historicalandrevision-note -->
<!-- field-start:miscellaneous-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">1958 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;full-time&rdquo; is inserted for clarity. The other change reflects the opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1956/1908, Feb. 13, 1956) that duty performed under section 92 of the National Defense Act, the source statute for section 502 of title 32, was creditable in determining entitlement to retired pay under section 302 of the Army and Air Force Vitalization and Retirement Equalization Act of 1948 (62 Stat. 1087), the source statute for section 1332 of title 10.</p>
