<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on Details</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No agreement detailing an officer of the armed forces to an accredited medical school or school of osteopathy may be entered into during any period in which the President is authorized by law to induct persons into the armed forces involuntarily.
