<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Notification of Decision</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If, as a result of the completion of the examinations under subsection (b)(3), a decision is made to change the commercial or industrial type function that was the subject of the analysis to performance by the private sector, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report describing that decision.
