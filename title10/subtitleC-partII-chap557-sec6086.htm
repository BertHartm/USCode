<p class="statutory-body">(b) Under such regulations as the Secretary prescribes, officers in the Nurse Corps may be subsisted in hospital messes. Each officer so subsisted shall pay for her subsistence at the rate fixed by the regulations.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;active duty&rdquo; before the words &ldquo;enlisted personnel&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage since there is no authority to hospitalize an enlisted member in a naval hospital under conditions where he would not be entitled to a hospital ration. The words &ldquo;active and inactive&rdquo; before the words &ldquo;retired enlisted personnel&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The word &ldquo;members&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;personnel&rdquo; for uniformity. The words &ldquo;the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve&rdquo; are inserted for clarity since the term &ldquo;Fleet Reserve&rdquo; in the source statute is used in a generic sense and includes members of the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the words &ldquo;that nothing contained in this section shall deprive such nurses of allowances for subsistence now or after August 2, 1946, provided by law&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. Section 301 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 251) authorizes a basic allowance for subsistence for all officers entitled to basic pay.</p>
