<p class="statutory-body">(2) The energy performance goals shall be submitted annually not later than the date on which the President submits to Congress the budget for the next fiscal year under section 1105 of title 31 and cover that fiscal year as well as the next five, l0, and 20 years. The Secretary shall identify changes to the energy performance goals since the previous submission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Energy Performance Plan</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall develop, and update as necessary, a comprehensive plan to help achieve the energy performance goals for the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Special Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For the purpose of developing and implementing the energy performance goals and energy performance plan, the Secretary of Defense shall consider at a minimum the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Opportunities to reduce the current rate of consumption of energy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Opportunities to reduce the future demand and the requirements for the use of energy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Opportunities to implement conservation measures to improve the efficient use of energy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Opportunities to pursue alternative energy initiatives, including the use of alternative fuels in military vehicles and equipment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Cost effectiveness, cost savings, and net present value of alternatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The value of diversification of types and sources of energy used.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The value of economies-of-scale associated with fewer energy types used.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The value of the use of renewable energy sources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The potential for an action to serve as an incentive for members of the armed forces and civilian personnel to reduce energy consumption or adopt an improved energy performance measure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Selection of Energy Conservation Measures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) For the purpose of implementing the energy performance plan, the Secretary of Defense shall provide that the selection of energy conservation measures, including energy efficient maintenance, shall be limited to those measures that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) are readily available;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) demonstrate an economic return on the investment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) are consistent with the energy performance goals and energy performance plan for the Department; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) are supported by the special considerations specified in subsection (c).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In this subsection, the term &ldquo;energy efficient maintenance&rdquo; includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the repair of military vehicles, equipment, or facility and infrastructure systems, such as lighting, heating, or cooling equipment or systems, or industrial processes, by replacement with technology that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) will achieve energy savings over the life-cycle of the equipment or system being repaired; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) will meet the same end needs as the equipment or system being repaired; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) improvements in an operation or maintenance process, such as improved training or improved controls, that result in energy savings.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Goal Regarding Use of Renewable Energy To Meet Electricity Needs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It shall be the goal of the Department of Defense&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to produce or procure not less than 25 percent of the total quantity of electric energy it consumes within its facilities and in its activities during fiscal year 2025 and each fiscal year thereafter from renewable energy sources (as defined in section 203(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15852(b))); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to produce or procure electric energy from renewable energy sources whenever the use of such renewable energy sources is consistent with the energy performance goals and energy performance plan for the Department and supported by the special considerations specified in subsection (c).</p>
