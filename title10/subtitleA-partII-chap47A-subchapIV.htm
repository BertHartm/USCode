<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Procedures and Rules of Evidence</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Pretrial, trial, and post-trial procedures, including elements and modes of proof, for cases triable by military commission under this chapter may be prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Attorney General. Such procedures shall, so far as the Secretary considers practicable or consistent with military or intelligence activities, apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence in trial by general courts-martial. Such procedures and rules of evidence may not be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Rules for Military Commission</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Notwithstanding any departures from the law and the rules of evidence in trial by general courts-martial authorized by subsection (a), the procedures and rules of evidence in trials by military commission under this chapter shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The accused shall be permitted to present evidence in his defense, to cross-examine the witnesses who testify against him, and to examine and respond to evidence admitted against him on the issue of guilt or innocence and for sentencing, as provided for by this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The accused shall be present at all sessions of the military commission (other than those for deliberations or voting), except when excluded under section 949d of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In establishing procedures and rules of evidence for military commission proceedings, the Secretary of Defense may prescribe the following provisions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Evidence shall be admissible if the military judge determines that the evidence would have probative value to a reasonable person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Evidence shall not be excluded from trial by military commission on the grounds that the evidence was not seized pursuant to a search warrant or other authorization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A statement of the accused that is otherwise admissible shall not be excluded from trial by military commission on grounds of alleged coercion or compulsory self-incrimination so long as the evidence complies with the provisions of section 948r of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Evidence shall be admitted as authentic so long as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the military judge of the military commission determines that there is sufficient basis to find that the evidence is what it is claimed to be; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the military judge instructs the members that they may consider any issue as to authentication or identification of evidence in determining the weight, if any, to be given to the evidence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), hearsay evidence not otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence applicable in trial by general courts-martial may be admitted in a trial by military commission if the proponent of the evidence makes known to the adverse party, sufficiently in advance to provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to meet the evidence, the intention of the proponent to offer the evidence, and the particulars of the evidence (including information on the general circumstances under which the evidence was obtained). The disclosure of evidence under the preceding sentence is subject to the requirements and limitations applicable to the disclosure of classified information in section 949j(c) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Hearsay evidence not otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence applicable in trial by general courts-martial shall not be admitted in a trial by military commission if the party opposing the admission of the evidence demonstrates that the evidence is unreliable or lacking in probative value.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) The military judge shall exclude any evidence the probative value of which is substantially outweighed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the commission; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The accused in a military commission under this chapter who exercises the right to self-representation under paragraph (1)(D) shall conform his deportment and the conduct of the defense to the rules of evidence, procedure, and decorum applicable to trials by military commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Failure of the accused to conform to the rules described in subparagraph (A) may result in a partial or total revocation by the military judge of the right of self-representation under paragraph (1)(D). In such case, the detailed defense counsel of the accused or an appropriately authorized civilian counsel shall perform the functions necessary for the defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Delegation of Authority To Prescribe Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense may delegate the authority of the Secretary to prescribe regulations under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Notification to Congressional Committees of Changes to Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 60 days before the date on which any proposed modification of the procedures in effect for military commissions under this chapter goes into effect, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives a report describing the modification.</p>
