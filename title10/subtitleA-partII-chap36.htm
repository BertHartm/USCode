A selection board shall consist of five or more officers of the same armed force as the officers under consideration by the board. Each member of a selection board (except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4)) shall be an officer on the active-duty list. Each member of a selection board must be serving in a grade higher than the grade of the officers under consideration by the board, except that no member of a board may be serving in a grade below major or lieutenant commander.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a selection board shall include at least one officer from each competitive category of officers to be considered by the board.</p>

However, in such a case the Secretary of the military department concerned, in his discretion, may appoint as a member of the board an officer of that competitive category who is not on the active-duty list from among officers of the same armed force as the officers under consideration by the board who hold a higher grade than the grade of the officers under consideration and who are retired officers, reserve officers serving on active duty but not on the active-duty list, or members of the Ready Reserve.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) When reserve officers of an armed force are to be considered by a selection board, the membership of the board shall include at least one reserve officer of that armed force on active duty (whether or not on the active-duty list). The actual number of reserve officers shall be determined by the Secretary of the military department concerned, in the Secretary's discretion. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this paragraph, in the case of a board which is considering officers in the grade of colonel or brigadier general or, in the case of officers of the Navy, captain or rear admiral (lower half), no reserve officer need be included if there are no reserve officers of that armed force on active duty in the next higher grade who are eligible to serve on the board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), if qualified officers on the active-duty list are not available in sufficient number to comprise a selection board, the Secretary of the military department concerned shall complete the membership of the board by appointing as members of the board officers who are members of the same armed force and hold a grade higher than the grade of the officers under consideration by the board and who are retired officers, reserve officers serving on active duty but not on the active-duty list, or members of the Ready Reserve.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A retired general or flag officer who is on active duty for the purpose of serving on a selection board shall not, while so serving, be counted against any limitation on the number of general and flag officers who may be on active duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) No officer may be a member of two successive selection boards convened under section 611(a) of this title for the consideration of officers of the same competitive category and grade.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A selection board convened under section 611(a) of this title shall recommend for promotion to the next higher grade those officers considered by the board whom the board, giving due consideration to the needs of the armed <!-- PDFPage:303 -->force concerned for officers with particular skills (as noted in the guidelines or information furnished the board under section 615(b) of this title), considers best qualified for promotion within each competitive category considered by the board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary of the military department concerned shall establish the number of officers such a selection board may recommend for promotion from among officers being considered from below the promotion zone in any competitive category. Such number may not exceed the number equal to 10 percent of the maximum number of officers that the board is authorized to recommend for promotion in such competitive category, except that the Secretary of Defense may authorize a greater number, not to exceed 15 percent of the total number of officers that the board is authorized to recommend for promotion, if the Secretary of Defense determines that the needs of the service so require. If the number determined under this subsection is less than one, the board may recommend one such officer. The number of officers recommended for promotion from below the promotion zone does not increase the maximum number of officers which the board is authorized under section 615 of this title to recommend for promotion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A selection board convened under section 611(a) of this title may not recommend an officer for promotion unless&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a majority of the members of the board finds that the officer is fully qualified for promotion; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a majority of the members of the board, after consideration by all members of the board of any adverse information about the officer that is provided to the board under section 615 of this title, finds that the officer is among the officers best qualified for promotion to meet the needs of the armed force concerned consistent with the requirement of exemplary conduct set forth in section 3583, 5947, or 8583 of this title, as applicable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Except as otherwise provided by law, an officer on the active-duty list may not be promoted to a higher grade under this chapter unless he is considered and recommended for promotion to that grade by a selection board convened under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The recommendations of a selection board may be disclosed only in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense. Those recommendations may not be disclosed to a person not a member of the board (or a member of the administrative staff designated by the Secretary concerned to assist the board) until the written report of the recommendations of the board, required by section 617 of this title, is signed by each member of the board.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) A requirement that such a preselection board may not recommend that an officer be precluded from such consideration unless the Secretary concerned has given the officer advance written notice of the convening of such board and of the military records that will be considered by the board and has given the officer a reasonable period before the convening of the board in which to submit comments to the board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) A requirement that the Secretary convening such a preselection board shall provide general guidance to the board in accordance with standards and procedures prescribed by the Secretary of Defense in those regulations.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) When the report of a selection board convened under section 611(a) of this title is approved by the President, the Secretary of the military department concerned shall place the names of all officers approved for promotion within a competitive category on a single list for that competitive category, to be known as a promotion list, in the order of the seniority of such officers on the active-duty list. A promotion list is considered to be established under this section as of the date of the approval of the report of the selection board under the preceding sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in subsection (d), officers on a promotion list for a competitive category shall be promoted to the next higher grade when additional officers in that grade and <!-- PDFPage:312 -->competitive category are needed. Promotions shall be made in the order in which the names of officers appear on the promotion list and after officers previously selected for promotion in that competitive category have been promoted. Officers to be promoted to the grade of first lieutenant or lieutenant (junior grade) shall be promoted in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subsection (d), officers on the active-duty list in the grade of first lieutenant or, in the case of the Navy, lieutenant (junior grade) who are on an approved all-fully-qualified-officers list shall be promoted to the next higher grade in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An all-fully-qualified-officers list shall be considered to be approved for purposes of subparagraph (A) when the list is approved by the President. When so approved, such a list shall be treated in the same manner as a promotion list under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary of a military department may make a recommendation to the President for approval of an all-fully-qualified-officers list only when the Secretary determines that all officers on the list are needed in the next higher grade to accomplish mission objectives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this paragraph, an all-fully-qualified-officers list is a list of all officers on the active-duty list in a grade who the Secretary of the military department concerned determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) are fully qualified for promotion to the next higher grade; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) would be eligible for consideration for promotion to the next higher grade by a selection board convened under section 611(a) of this title upon the convening of such a board.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) A regular officer who is promoted under this section is appointed in the regular grade to which promoted and a reserve officer who is promoted under this section is appointed in the reserve grade to which promoted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The date of rank of an officer appointed to a higher grade under this section is determined under section 741(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Appointments under this section shall be made by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, except that appointments under this section in the grade of first lieutenant or captain, in the case of officers of the Army, Air Force, or Marine Corps, or lieutenant (junior grade) or lieutenant, in the case of officers of the Navy, shall be made by the President alone.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, the appointment of an officer under this section may be delayed if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) sworn charges against the officer have been received by an officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the officer and such charges have not been disposed of;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an investigation is being conducted to determine whether disciplinary action of any kind should be brought against the officer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a board of officers has been convened under chapter 60 of this title to review the record of the officer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a criminal proceeding in a Federal or State court is pending against the officer; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) substantiated adverse information about the officer that is material to the decision to appoint the officer is under review by the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary concerned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If no disciplinary action is taken against the officer, if the charges against the officer are withdrawn or dismissed, if the officer is not ordered removed from active duty by the Secretary concerned under chapter 60 of this title, if the officer is acquitted of the charges brought against him, or if, after a review of substantiated adverse information about the officer regarding the requirement for exemplary conduct set forth in section 3583, 5947, or 8583 of this title, as applicable, the officer is determined to be among the officers best qualified for promotion, as the case may be, then unless action to delay an appointment has also been taken under paragraph (2) the officer shall be retained on the promotion list (including an approved all-fully-qualified-officers list, if applicable) and shall, upon promotion to the next higher grade, have the same date of rank, the same effective date for the pay and allowances of the grade to which promoted, and the same position on the active-duty list as he would have had if no delay had intervened, unless the Secretary concerned determines that the officer was unqualified for promotion for any part of the delay. If the Secretary makes such a determination, the Secretary may adjust such date of rank, effective date of pay and allowances, and position on the active-duty list as the Secretary considers appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, the appointment of an officer under this section may also be delayed in any case in which there is cause to believe that the officer has not met the requirement for exemplary conduct set forth in section 3583, 5947, or 8583 of this title, as applicable, or is mentally, physically, morally, or professionally unqualified to perform the duties of the grade for which he was selected for promotion. If it is later determined by a civilian official of the Department of Defense (not below the level of Secretary of a military department) that the officer is qualified for promotion to such grade and, after a review of adverse information regarding the requirement for exemplary conduct set forth in section 3583, 5947, or 8583 of this title, as applicable, the officer is determined to be among the officers best qualified for promotion to such grade, the officer shall be retained on the promotion list (including an approved all-fully-qualified-officers list, if applicable) and shall, upon such promotion, have the same date of rank, the same effective date for pay and allowances in the higher grade to which appointed, and the same position on the active-duty list as he would have had if no delay had intervened, unless the Secretary concerned determines that the officer was unqualified for promotion for any part of the delay. If the Secretary makes such a determination, the Secretary may adjust such date of rank, effective date of pay and allowances, and position on the active-duty list as the Secretary considers appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The appointment of an officer may not be delayed under this subsection unless the officer <!-- PDFPage:313 -->has been given written notice of the grounds for the delay, unless it is impracticable to give such written notice before the effective date of the appointment, in which case such written notice shall be given as soon as practicable. An officer whose promotion has been delayed under this subsection shall be afforded an opportunity to make a written statement to the Secretary concerned in response to the action taken. Any such statement shall be given careful consideration by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An appointment of an officer may not be delayed under this subsection for more than six months after the date on which the officer would otherwise have been appointed unless the Secretary concerned specifies a further period of delay. An officer's appointment may not be delayed more than 90 days after final action has been taken in any criminal case against such officer in a Federal or State court, more than 90 days after final action has been taken in any court-martial case against such officer, or more than 18 months after the date on which such officer would otherwise have been appointed, whichever is later.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;628. Special selection boards</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Persons Not Considered by Promotion Boards Due to Administrative Error</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Secretary of the military department concerned determines that because of administrative error a person who should have been considered for selection for promotion from in or above the promotion zone by a promotion board was not so considered, or the name of a person that should have been placed on an all-fully-qualified-officers list under section 624(a)(3) of this title was not so placed, the Secretary shall convene a special selection board under this subsection to determine whether that person (whether or not then on active duty) should be recommended for promotion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A special selection board convened under paragraph (1) shall consider the record of the person whose name was referred to it for consideration as that record would have appeared to the board that should have considered him. That record shall be compared with a sampling of the records of those officers of the same competitive category who were recommended for promotion, and those officers who were not recommended for promotion, by the board that should have considered him.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a special selection board convened under paragraph (1) does not recommend for promotion a person whose name was referred to it for consideration for selection for appointment to a grade other than a general officer or flag officer grade, the person shall be considered to have failed of selection for promotion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Persons Considered by Promotion Boards in Unfair Manner</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Secretary of the military department concerned determines, in the case of a person who was considered for selection for promotion by a promotion board but was not selected, that there was material unfairness with respect to that person, the Secretary may convene a special selection board under this subsection to determine whether that person (whether or not then on active duty) should be recommended for promotion. In order to determine that there was material unfairness, the Secretary must determine that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the action of the promotion board that considered the person was contrary to law in a matter material to the decision of the board or involved material error of fact or material administrative error; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the board did not have before it for its consideration material information.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A special selection board convened under paragraph (1) shall consider the record of the person whose name was referred to it for consideration as that record, if corrected, would have appeared to the board that considered him. That record shall be compared with the records of a sampling of those officers of the same competitive category who were recommended for promotion, and those officers who were not recommended for promotion, by the board that considered him.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a special selection board convened under paragraph (1) does not recommend for promotion a person whose name was referred to it for consideration, the person incurs no additional failure of selection for promotion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Reports of Boards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Each special selection board convened under this section shall submit to the Secretary of the military department concerned a written report, signed by each member of the board, containing the name of each person it recommends for promotion and certifying that the board has carefully considered the record of each person whose name was referred to it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of sections 617(b) and 618 of this title apply to the report and proceedings of a special selection board convened under this section in the same manner as they apply to the report and proceedings of a selection board convened under section 611(a) of this title. However, in the case of a board convened under this section to consider a warrant officer or former warrant officer, the provisions of sections 576(d) and 576(f) of this title (rather than the provisions of sections 617(b) and 618 of this title) apply to the report and proceedings of the board in the same manner as they apply to the report and proceedings of a selection board convened under section 573 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Appointment of Persons Selected by Boards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the report of a special selection board convened under this section, as approved by the President, recommends for promotion to the next higher grade a person whose name was referred to it for consideration, that person shall, as soon as practicable, be appointed to that grade in accordance with subsections (b), (c), and (d) of section 624 of this title. However, in the case of a board convened under this section to consider a warrant officer or former warrant officer, if the report of that board, as approved by the Secretary concerned, recommends that warrant officer or former warrant officer for promotion to the next higher grade, that person shall, as soon as practicable, be appointed to the next higher grade in accordance with provisions of section 578(c) of this title (rather than subsections (b), (c), and (d) of section 624 of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person who is appointed to the next higher grade as the result of the recommendation of <!-- PDFPage:316 -->a special selection board convened under this section shall, upon that appointment, have the same date of rank, the same effective date for the pay and allowances of that grade, and the same position on the active-duty list as he would have had if he had been recommended for promotion to that grade by the board which should have considered, or which did consider, him. In the case of a person who is not on the active-duty list when appointed to the next higher grade, placement of that person on the active-duty list pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be only for purposes of determination of eligibility of that person for consideration for promotion by any subsequent special selection board under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Deceased Persons</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a person whose name is being considered for referral to a special selection board under this section dies before the completion of proceedings under this section with respect to that person, this section shall be applied to that person posthumously.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Convening of Boards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A board convened under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall be convened under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall be composed in accordance with section 612 of this title or, in the case of board to consider a warrant officer or former warrant officer, in accordance with section 573 of this title and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the military department concerned; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall be subject to the provisions of section 613 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Judicial Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) A court of the United States may review a determination by the Secretary of a military department under subsection (a)(1) or (b)(1) not to convene a special selection board in the case of any person. In any such case, the court may set aside the Secretary's determination only if the court finds the determination to be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) arbitrary or capricious;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) not based on substantial evidence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) a result of material error of fact or material administrative error; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) otherwise contrary to law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If a court sets aside a determination by the Secretary of a military department not to convene a special selection board under this section, it shall remand the case to the Secretary concerned, who shall provide for consideration by such a board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A court of the United States may review the action of a special selection board convened under this section or an action of the Secretary of the military department concerned on the report of such a board. In any such case, a court may set aside the action only if the court finds that the action was&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) arbitrary or capricious;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) not based on substantial evidence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a result of material error of fact or material administrative error; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) otherwise contrary to law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If, six months after receiving a complete application for consideration by a special selection board under this section in any case, the Secretary concerned has not convened such a board and has not denied consideration by such a board in that case, the Secretary shall be deemed for the purposes of this subsection to have denied the consideration of the case by such a board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If, six months after the convening of a special selection board under this section in any case, the Secretary concerned has not taken final action on the report of the board, the Secretary shall be deemed for the purposes of this subsection to have denied relief in such case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Under regulations prescribed under subsection (j), the Secretary of a military department may waive the applicability of subparagraph (A) or (B) in a case if the Secretary determines that a longer period for consideration of the case is warranted. Such a waiver may be for an additional period of not more than six months. The Secretary concerned may not delegate authority to make a determination under this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Limitations of Other Jurisdiction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No official or court of the United States may, with respect to a claim based to any extent on the failure of a person to be selected for promotion by a promotion board&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consider the claim unless the person has first been referred by the Secretary concerned to a special selection board convened under this section and acted upon by that board and the report of the board has been approved by the President; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) except as provided in subsection (g), grant any relief on the claim unless the person has been selected for promotion by a special selection board convened under this section to consider the person for recommendation for promotion and the report of the board has been approved by the President.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Existing Jurisdiction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section limits&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the jurisdiction of any court of the United States under any provision of law to determine the validity of any law, regulation, or policy relating to selection boards; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the authority of the Secretary of a military department to correct a military record under section 1552 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of each military department shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section. Regulations under this subsection may not apply to subsection (g), other than to paragraph (3)(C) of that subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may prescribe in the regulations under paragraph (1) the circumstances under which consideration by a special selection board may be provided for under this section, including the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The circumstances under which consideration of a person's case by a special selection board is contingent upon application by or for that person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Any time limits applicable to the filing of an application for such consideration.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Regulations prescribed by the Secretary of a military department under this subsection may not take effect until approved by the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Promotion Board Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;promotion board&rdquo; means a se<!-- PDFPage:317 -->lection board convened by the Secretary of a military department under section 573(a) or 611(a) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Removal by President</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The President may remove the name of any officer from a list of officers recommended for promotion by a selection board convened under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Removal Due to Senate Not Giving Advice and Consent</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, after consideration of a list of officers approved for promotion by the President to a grade for which appointment is required by section 624(c) of this title to be made by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, the Senate does not give its advice and consent to the appointment of an officer whose name is on the list, that officer's name shall be removed from the list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Removal After</cap-smallcap> 18 <cap-smallcap>Months</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If an officer whose name is on a list of officers approved for promotion under section 624(a) of this title to a grade for which appointment is required by section 624(c) of this title to be made by and with the advice and consent of the Senate is not appointed to that grade under such section during the officer's promotion eligibility period, the officer's name shall be removed from the list unless as of the end of such period the Senate has given its advice and consent to the appointment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before the end of the promotion eligibility period with respect to an officer under paragraph (1), the President may extend that period for purposes of paragraph (1) by an additional 12 months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In this subsection, the term &ldquo;promotion eligibility period&rdquo; means, with respect to an officer whose name is on a list of officers approved for promotion under section 624(a) of this title to a grade for which appointment is required by section 624(c) of this title to be made by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, the period beginning on the date on which the list is so approved and ending on the first day of the eighteenth month following the month during which the list is so approved.</p>
