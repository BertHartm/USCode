<p class="note-body">Section 4 of the Act of January 16, 1936, ch. 3, 49 Stat. 1092, provided that persons who were then members of the teaching staff should have the right to participate in benefits under the Act if they requested such participation within 60 days. Members who were then under the civil-service retirement system were required to choose whether they would remain under it or would participate in the system established by the 1936 Act. They could not come under both. The section also authorized the Secretary of the Navy to supplement the retired income of members who elected to come under the 1936 Act and whose age in 1936 was such that they could not purchase adequate annuities before retiring. The provisions whereby members could elect to participate were temporary and are executed. The provisions relating to retired income are superseded by &sect;4A, added by the Act of November 28, 1943, ch. 331, 57 Stat. 594. The only remaining effect of &sect;4 and the second proviso of &sect;4A is to exclude from the benefits and requirements of the 1936 Act persons who were members of the teaching staff in 1936 and did not elect to participate.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7086. Physical disability retirement</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Each civilian member who has served not less than five years, and who, before reaching the age of 65, becomes totally disabled for useful and efficient service in his position, by reason of disease or injury not due to his own vicious habits, intemperance, or willful misconduct shall, upon his application or upon the request of the Secretary of the Navy, be retired with a life annuity computed under section 7085 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The amount that the Secretary shall pay annually under this section is the difference between the total amount to which the retired member is entitled under subsection (a) and the immediate life annuity to which he is entitled at the time of his disability retirement under the annuity policy required by section 7082 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Each civilian member retired under this section, unless the disability for which he was retired is permanent in character, shall be examined by a board of medical officers designated by the Superintendent of the Naval Academy or of the Postgraduate School, as appropriate, one year after his retirement and annually thereafter, until he becomes 65 years of age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Payments by the Secretary under this section shall be terminated if the retired civilian member is found to be sufficiently recovered for useful and efficient service in his former position and is offered reemployment in that position by the Superintendent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If a civilian member retired under this section is later reemployed by the United States, the payments by the Secretary shall be terminated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Each civilian member retired under this section who is reemployed as a civilian member of the teaching staff of the Naval Academy or the Naval Postgraduate School shall, upon his later retirement, be paid annually by the Secretary the difference between the total annual amount computed under section 7085 of this title and the immediate life annuity which the total premiums paid on his annuity contracts would buy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) No person may receive payments from the Secretary of the Navy under this chapter and, for the same period of time, compensation under chapter 81 of title 5.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) At the time of his retirement, a civilian member retiring under this chapter may elect to receive instead of the amount payable annually by the Secretary of the Navy under section 7085 or 7086 of this title a reduced annuity for his life and an annuity payable after his death to his beneficiary in either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an amount equal to his reduced annuity; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an amount equal to 50 percent of his reduced annuity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The annuities payable to principal and beneficiary, under either election, shall be in amounts that have, on the date of the retirement of the civilian member, a combined actuarial value equal to the actuarial value of the annuity payable by the Secretary under section 7085 or 7086 of this title, as determined under actuarial tables prepared by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If the civilian member elects to take a reduced annuity under this section, he shall, at the time of his retirement, designate the beneficiary in writing and file the designation with the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The annuity payable under this section to the beneficiary of a deceased civilian member shall be terminated upon the death of the beneficiary.</p>
