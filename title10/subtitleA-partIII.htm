<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary concerned may require, as a condition to the Secretary providing advanced education assistance to any person, that such person enter into a written agreement with the Secretary concerned under the terms of which such person shall agree&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to complete the educational requirements specified in the agreement and to serve on active duty for a period specified in the agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that if such person fails to complete the education requirements specified in the agreement, such person will serve on active duty for a period specified in the agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that if such person, voluntarily or because of misconduct, fails to complete the period of active duty specified in the agreement, or fails to fulfill any term or condition prescribed pursuant to clause (4), such person will reimburse the United States in an amount that bears the same ratio to the total cost of advanced education provided such person as the unserved portion of active duty bears to the total period of active duty such person agreed to serve; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to such other terms and conditions as the Secretary concerned may prescribe to protect the interest of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary concerned shall determine the period of active duty to be served by any person for advanced education assistance to be provided such person by an armed force, except that if the period of active duty required to be served is specified under another provision of law with respect to the advanced education assistance to be provided, the period specified in the agreement referred to in subsection (a) shall be the same as the period specified in such other provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Subject to the provisions of subsection (d), the obligation to reimburse the United States under an agreement described in subsection (a) is, for all purposes, a debt owing the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A discharge in bankruptcy under title 11 shall not release a person from an obligation to reimburse the United States required under the terms of an agreement described in subsection (a) if the final decree of the discharge in bankruptcy was issued within a period of five years after the last day of a period which such person had agreed to serve on active duty. This subsection applies to a discharge in bankruptcy in any proceeding which begins after September 30, 1978.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;advanced education&rdquo; means education or training above the secondary school level but does not include technical training provided to a member of the armed forces to qualify such member to perform a specified military function, to workshops, or to short-term training programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; means the direct provision of any course of advanced education by the Secretary concerned, reimbursement by the Secretary concerned for any course of advanced education provided by another department or agency of the Federal Government, or the payment, in whole or in part, by the Secretary concerned for any course of advanced education provided by any public or private educational institution or other entity, but such term does not include the payment for any course of advanced education which is paid for under chapter 106 or 107 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;cost of advanced education&rdquo; means those costs which are, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, directly attributable to the education of the person to whom a course of advanced education is provided, including the cost of tuition and other fees (or, if none is charged, an amount determined by the Secretary concerned to be a reasonable charge for the education provided), the cost of books, supplies, transportation, and miscellaneous expenses, and the cost of room and board, but such term does not include pay or allowances under title 37 or a stipend under section 2121 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary concerned shall require, as a condition to the Secretary providing financial assistance under section 2107 or 2107a of this title to any person, that such person enter into an agreement described in subsection (a). In addition to the requirements of clauses (1) through (4) of such subsection, any agreement required by this subsection shall provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that if such person fails to complete the education requirements specified in the agreement, or fails to fulfill any term or condition <!-- PDFPage:821 -->prescribed pursuant to clause (4) of such subsection, the Secretary will have the option to order such person to reimburse the United States in the manner provided for in clause (3) of such subsection without the Secretary first ordering such person to active duty as provided for under clause (2) of such subsection and sections 2107(f) and 2107a(f) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that any amount owed by such person to the United States under such agreement shall bear interest at the rate equal to the highest rate being paid by the United States on the day on which the reimbursement is determined to be due for securities having maturities of ninety days or less and shall accrue from the day on which the member is first notified of the amount due to the United States as a reimbursement under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) In any case in which the Secretary concerned determines that a person who entered into an agreement under this section failed to complete the period of active duty specified in the agreement (or failed to fulfill any other term or condition prescribed in the agreement) and, by reason of the provision of the agreement required under subsection (a)(3), may owe a debt to the United States and in which that person disputes that such a debt is owed, the Secretary shall designate a member of the armed forces or a civilian employee under the jurisdiction of the Secretary to investigate the facts of the case and hear evidence presented by the person who may owe the debt and other parties, as appropriate, in order to determine the validity of the debt. That official shall report the official's findings and recommendations to the Secretary concerned. If the justification for the debt investigated includes an allegation of misconduct, the investigating official shall state in the report the official's assessment as to whether the individual behavior that resulted in the separation of the person who may owe the debt qualifies as misconduct under subsection (a)(3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of each military department shall ensure that a member of the armed forces who may be subject to a reimbursement requirement under this section is advised of such requirement before (1) submitting a request for voluntary separation, or (2) making a decision on a course of action regarding personal involvement in administrative, nonjudicial, and judicial action resulting from alleged misconduct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The Secretary concerned may, at any time before October 1, 1998, modify an agreement described in subsection (a) to reduce the active duty service obligation specified in the agreement if the Secretary determines that it is in the best interests of the United States to do so. In such a case, the Secretary shall reduce the amount required to be reimbursed to the United States proportionately with the reduction in the period of obligated active duty service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Secretary of each military department shall establish and maintain a Junior Reserve Officers&rsquo; Training Corps, organized into units, at public and private secondary educational institutions which apply for a unit and meet the standards and criteria prescribed pursuant to this section. The President shall promulgate regulations prescribing the standards and criteria to be followed by the military departments in selecting the institutions at which units are to be established and maintained and shall provide for the fair and equitable distribution of such units throughout the Nation, except that more than one such unit may be established and maintained at any military institute.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) It is a purpose of the Junior Reserve Officers&rsquo; Training Corps to instill in students in United States secondary educational institutions the values of citizenship, service to the United States, and personal responsibility and a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) No unit may be established or maintained at an institution unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the number of physically fit students in such unit who are in a grade above the 8th grade and are citizens or nationals of the United States, or aliens lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence, is not less than (A) 10 percent of the number of students enrolled in the institution who are in a grade above the 8th grade, or (B) 100, whichever is less;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the institution has adequate facilities for classroom instruction, storage of arms and other equipment which may be furnished in support of the unit, and adequate drill areas at or in the immediate vicinity of the institution, as determined by the Secretary of the military department concerned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the institution provides a course of military instruction of not less than three academic years&rsquo; duration, as prescribed by the Secretary of the military department concerned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the institution agrees to limit membership in the unit to students who maintain acceptable standards of academic achievement and conduct, as prescribed by the Secretary of the military department concerned; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the unit meets such other requirements as may be established by the Secretary of the military department concerned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary of the military department concerned shall, to support the Junior Reserve Officers&rsquo; Training Corps program&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) detail officers and noncommissioned officers of an armed force under his jurisdiction to institutions having units of the Corps as administrators and instructors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide necessary text materials, equipment, and uniforms and, to the extent considered appropriate by the Secretary concerned, such additional resources (including transportation and billeting) as may be available to support activities of the program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) establish minimum acceptable standards for performance and achievement for qualified units.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Instead of, or in addition to, detailing officers and noncommissioned officers on active duty under subsection (c)(1), the Secretary of the military department concerned may authorize qualified institutions to employ, as administrators and instructors in the program, retired officers and noncommissioned officers, and members of the Fleet Reserve and Fleet Marine Corps Reserve, whose qualifications are approved by the Secretary and the institution concerned and who request such employment, subject to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A retired member so employed is entitled to receive the member's retired or retainer pay without reduction by reason of any additional amount paid to the member by the institution concerned. In the case of payment of any such additional amount by the institution concerned, the Secretary of the military department concerned shall pay to that institution the amount equal to one-half of the amount paid to the retired member by the institution for any period, up to a maximum of one-half of the difference between the member's retired or retainer pay for that period and the active duty pay and allowances which the member would have received for that period if on active duty. Notwithstanding the limitation in the preceding sentence, the Secretary concerned may pay to the institution more than one-half of the additional amount paid to the retired member by the institution if (as determined by the Secretary) the institution is in an educationally and economically deprived area and the Secretary determines that such action is in the national interest. Payments by the Secretary concerned under this paragraph shall be made from funds appropriated for that purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, such a retired member is not, while so employed, considered to be on active duty or inactive duty training for any purpose.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition of Senior Military Colleges</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this section, the term &lsquo;senior military colleges&rsquo; means the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Texas A&M University.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Norwich University.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) North Georgia College and State University.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The senior military colleges consistently have provided substantial numbers of highly qualified, long-serving leaders to the Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The quality of the military leaders produced by the senior military colleges is, in part, the result of the rigorous military environment imposed on students attending the senior military colleges by the colleges, as well as the result of the long-standing close support relationship between the Corps of Cadets at each college and the Reserve Officer Training Corps personnel at the colleges who serve as effective leadership role models and mentors.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:844 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In recognition of the quality of the young leaders produced by the senior military colleges, the Department of Defense and the military services have traditionally maintained special relationships with the colleges, including the policy to grant active duty service in the Army to graduates of the colleges who desire such service and who are recommended for such service by their ROTC professors of military science.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Each of the senior military colleges has demonstrated an ability to adapt its systems and operations to changing conditions in, and requirements of, the Armed Forces without compromising the quality of leaders produced and without interruption of the close relationship between the colleges and the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Sense of Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In light of the findings in subsection (b), it is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the proposed initiative of the Secretary of the Army to end the commitment to active duty service for all graduates of senior military colleges who desire such service and who are recommended for such service by their ROTC professors of military science is short-sighted and contrary to the long-term interests of the Army;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) as they have in the past, the senior military colleges can and will continue to accommodate to changing military requirements to ensure that future graduates entering military service continue to be officers of superb quality who are quickly assimilated by the Armed Forces and fully prepared to make significant contributions to the Armed Forces through extended military careers; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) decisions of the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of a military department that fundamentally and unilaterally change the long-standing relationship of the Armed Forces with the senior military colleges are not in the best interests of the Department of Defense or the Armed Forces and are patently unfair to students who made decisions to enroll in the senior military colleges on the basis of existing Department and Armed Forces policy.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Recommendations for Admission of Students Under the Program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall annually identify to the senior military colleges the international students who, based on criteria established by the Secretary, the Secretary recommends be considered for admission under the program.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Authority of Secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Secretary of Defense makes a determination that appropriate educational programs are not available through a local educational agency for dependents of members of the armed forces and dependents of civilian employees of the Federal Government residing on a military installation in the United States (including territories, commonwealths, and possessions of the United States), the Secretary may enter into arrangements to provide for the elementary or secondary education of the dependents of such members of the armed forces and, to the extent authorized in subsection (c), the dependents of such civilian employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may, at the discretion of the Secretary, permit dependents of members of the armed forces and, to the extent provided in subsection (c), dependents of civilian employees of the Federal Government residing in a territory, commonwealth, or possession of the United States but not on a military installation, to enroll in an educational program provided by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection. If a member of the armed forces is assigned to a remote location or is assigned to an unaccompanied tour of duty, a dependent of the member who resides, on or off a military installation, in a territory, commonwealth, or possession of the United States, as authorized by the member's orders, may be enrolled in an educational program provided by the Secretary under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Factors for Secretary To Consider</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Factors to be considered by the Secretary of Defense in making a determination under subsection (a) shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The extent to which such dependents are eligible for free public education in the local area adjacent to the military installation.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:864 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The extent to which the local educational agency is able to provide an appropriate educational program for such dependents.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), an appropriate educational program is a program that, as determined by the Secretary, is comparable to a program of free public education provided for children by the following local educational agencies:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), a dependent of a Federal employee who is enrolled in an educational program provided by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (a) and who is not residing on a military installation may be enrolled in the program for not more than five consecutive school years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) At the discretion of the Secretary, a dependent referred to in subparagraph (A) may be enrolled in the program for more than five consecutive school years if the dependent is otherwise qualified for enrollment, space is available in the program, and the Secretary will be reimbursed for the educational services provided. Any such extension shall cover only one school year at a time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an individual who is a dependent of a Federal employee in the excepted service (as defined in section 2103 of title 5) and who is enrolled in an educational program provided by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (a) in Puerto Rico, Wake Island, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands.</p>
