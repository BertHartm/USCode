The budget for the Department of Defense submitted to Congress for each fiscal year shall include data projecting the effect of the appropriations requested for materiel readiness requirements. The Secretary of Defense shall provide that the budget justification documents for such budget include information on the number of employees of contractors estimated to be working on contracts of the Department of Defense during the fiscal year for which the budget is submitted. Such information shall be set forth in terms of employee-years or such other measure as will be uniform and readily comparable with civilian personnel of the Department of Defense.</p>
