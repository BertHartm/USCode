The words &ldquo;or to another executive department of the Government&rdquo; are omitted as superseded by section 7 of the act of May 21, 1920, ch. 194, as amended (31 U.S.C. 686). The provisions of 10:1253 relating to the computation of cost are omitted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (63 Stat. 585), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses.

The words &ldquo;or in Alaska&rdquo; are omitted, since, under section 101(1) of this title, the words &ldquo;United States&rdquo; are defined to include only the States and the District of Columbia. The word &ldquo;continental&rdquo;, after the words &ldquo;within the&rdquo;, is omitted for the same reason. The last sentence is substituted for 10:1241 (proviso).  </p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (i), 10:1196 (last 30 words) is omitted as superseded by the Act of April 27, 1914, ch. 72 (last proviso under &ldquo;Subsistence of the Army&rdquo;), 38 Stat. 361. The words &ldquo;So much of the&rdquo; and &ldquo;as may be necessary&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;members *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* on active duty, for the use of themselves and their families&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;officers for the use of themselves and their families, and to commanders of companies or other organizations, for the use of the enlisted men of their companies or organizations&rdquo;, to conform to 10:1237 and 1238. Those sections provide the basic authority for procurement and sale of subsistence supplies to all members. This interpretation conforms to established administrative practice under those sections. The word &ldquo;supplies&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;stores&rdquo;.  </p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a resident of the Armed Forces Retirement Home who dies in an Air Force hospital outside the District of Columbia when sent from the Home to that hospital for treatment;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the commanding officer of the place or command shall permit the legal representative or the surviving spouse of the deceased, if present, to take possession of the effects of the deceased that are then at the air base or in quarters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If there is no legal representative or surviving spouse present, the commanding officer shall direct a summary court-martial to collect the effects of the deceased that are then at the air base or in quarters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The summary court-martial may collect debts due the decedent's estate by local debtors, pay undisputed local creditors of the deceased to the extent permitted by money of the deceased in the court's possession, and shall take receipts for those payments, to be filed with the court's final report to the Department of the Air Force.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) As soon as practicable after the collection of the effects and money of the deceased, the summary court-martial shall send them at the expense of the United States to the living person highest on the following list who can be found by the court:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The surviving spouse or legal representative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A child of the deceased.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A beneficiary named in the will of the deceased.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If the summary court-martial cannot dispose of the effects under subsection (d) because there are no persons in those categories or because the court finds that the addresses of the persons are not known or readily ascertainable, the court may convert the effects of the deceased, except sabers, insignia, decorations, medals, watches, trinkets, manuscripts, and other articles valuable chiefly as keepsakes, into cash, by public or private sale, but not until 30 days after the date of death of the deceased.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) As soon as practicable after the effects have been converted into cash under subsection (e), the summary court-martial shall deposit all cash in the court's possession and belonging to the estate with the officer designated in regulations, and shall send a receipt therefor, together with any will or other papers of value, an inventory of the effects and articles not permitted to be sold, to the executive part of the Department of the Air Force. The Secretary of the Air Force shall deliver to the Armed Forces Retirement Home all items received by the executive part of the Department of the Air Force under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The summary court-martial shall make a full report of the transactions under this section, with respect to the deceased, to the Department of the Air Force for transmission to the General Accounting Office for action authorized in the settlement of accounts of deceased members of the Air Force.</p>

<p class="note-body">Before the enactment of the National Security Act of 1947, the transport functions covered by this section were performed only by the Army. Under Transfer Order 26, 15 Oct. 1948, JAAF Bull. 42, 1948; JAAFAR 4&ndash;55&ndash;1, par. 2a(1)(f), 29 Oct. 1948; AR 96&ndash;15, AFR 76&ndash;7, 5 June 1951; AR 96&ndash;20, AFR 76&ndash;6, 11 June 1953, these transport functions also became the responsibility of the Secretary of the Air Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under section 2(a)(3) of the National Security Act (as it existed before August 10, 1949), the sea transportation functions of the Army and Navy, and the air transportation functions of the Army, Navy, and Air Force were respectively consolidated into the &ldquo;Military Sea Transportation Service&rdquo;, under the Department of the Navy, and the &ldquo;Military Air Transport Service&rdquo;, under the Department of the Air Force. Instead of having space on transport vessels and airplanes operated by it for its sole use, the Air Force is allotted bulk space on vessels and airplanes operated by military transport agencies operating for the benefit of the Department of Defense as a whole. The words &ldquo;or, within bulk space allocations made to the Department of the Air Force, on vessels or airplanes operated by any military transport agency of the Department of Defense&rdquo; are inserted, in accordance with an opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1953/5885, 22 July 1953), concurred in by the Judge Advocate General of the Air Force, to make clear that the rule applicable to vessels and airplanes applies to the bulk space allocated to the Air Force. Since the authority to perform transportation functions could again be transferred as between the military departments, the references to airplanes of Air Force transport agencies (as distinct from bulk space allocations thereon) is retained.</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;considers&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;in the opinion of&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;Persons residing in Alaska who are and have been employed there by the United States&rdquo;, are substituted for the words &ldquo;employees of the United States, residing in Alaska, who have been in such employment&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;civil&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;from and after November 21, 1941&rdquo;, &ldquo;and the carriage of all such air traffic shall be terminated&rdquo;, &ldquo;dire&rdquo;, &ldquo;the privilege herein granted&rdquo;, and &ldquo;as to each eligible individual&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;the continental&rdquo; are omitted, since section 101(1) of this title defines the United States as &ldquo;the States and the District of Columbia&rdquo;.</p>
