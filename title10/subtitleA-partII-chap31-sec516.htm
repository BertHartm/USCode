<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The enlistment or period of obligated service of an enlisted member of the armed forces who accepts an appointment as a cadet at the United States Military Academy, the United States Air Force Academy, or the United States Coast Guard Academy, or as a midshipman at the United States Naval Academy or in the Navy Reserve, may not be terminated because of the acceptance of that appointment. However, while serving as a cadet or midshipman at an Academy, he is entitled only to the pay, allowances, compensation, pensions, and other benefits provided by law for such a cadet or midshipman or, if he is a midshipman in the Navy Reserve, to the compensation and emoluments of a midshipman in the Navy Reserve.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If a person covered by subsection (a) is separated from service as a cadet or midshipman, or from service as a midshipman in the Navy Reserve, for any reason other than his appointment as a commissioned officer of a regular or reserve component of an armed force or because of a physical disability, he resumes his enlisted status and shall complete the period of service for which he was enlisted or for which he has an obligation, unless he is sooner discharged. In computing the unexpired part of an enlistment or period of obligated service for the purposes of this subsection, all service as a cadet or midshipman is counted as service under that enlistment or period of obligated service.</p>
