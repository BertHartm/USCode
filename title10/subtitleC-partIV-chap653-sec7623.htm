<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;consider, ascertain, adjust, determine&rdquo; are omitted as covered by the word &ldquo;settle&rdquo;, as defined in section 7621(b) of this title. The words &ldquo;of the United States&rdquo; (following the word &ldquo;property&rdquo;), &ldquo;by contract or otherwise&rdquo;, and &ldquo;thereto&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;of a kind that is within the admiralty jurisdiction of&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;cognizable in admiralty in&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;receive payment of a claim * * * if the net amount to be received by the United States is not more than $1,000,000&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;receive in payment of any such claim the amount due the United States pursuant to determination, compromise, or settlement as herein authorized *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* <em>Provided, further</em>, That no settlement or compromise where there is involved a payment in the net amount of over $1,000,000 shall be authorized by this Act&rdquo;.</p>

The words &ldquo;the Secretary may delegate his authority&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;the authority of the Secretary of the Navy *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* may be exercised&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d) the words &ldquo;but not until then&rdquo;, &ldquo;for all purposes&rdquo;, and &ldquo;to the contrary&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (e) is worded to insure that the effect of a suit pending at any time is preserved and that the provision is not interpreted to apply only to suits that are pending on the date of enactment of this title.</p>
