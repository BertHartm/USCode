<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) within 45 days after the issuance of the solicitation, review the solicitation and report to Congress on whether the solicitation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provides substantially equal opportunity for public and private offerors to compete for the contract without regard to the location at which the workload is to be performed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is in compliance with the requirements of this section and all applicable provisions of law and regulations; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) within 45 days after any contract or award resulting from the solicitation is entered into or made, review the contract or award, including the contracting or award process, and report to Congress on whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the procedures used to conduct the competition&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) provided substantially equal opportunity for public and private offerors to compete for the contract without regard to the location at which the workload is to be performed; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Resolution of Workload Award Objections</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any public or private entity may, pursuant to procedures established by the Secretary, object to a solicitation of offers under this section for the performance of any depot-level maintenance and repair workload, or the award or proposed award of any workload pursuant to such a solicitation. The Secretary may designate a qualified individual or entity to review the objection; however, the Secretary shall not designate the Source Selection Authority or any individual from the same military department as the Source Selection Authority to review the objection. The Secretary shall take appropriate action to address any defect in the solicitation or award in the event that the objection is sustained.</p>
