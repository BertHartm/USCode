<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;award&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;present&rdquo; to cover the determination of the recipient as well as the actual presenting of the decoration. The words &ldquo;but not in the name of Congress&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage, since a decoration is presented in the name of Congress only if the law so directs. The proviso of the first sentence of 34 U.S.C. 364a is omitted as executed. The words &ldquo;Navy or the Marine Corps&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;United States Navy&rdquo; because the provision is interpreted as authorizing the award of the decoration to persons serving with the Marine Corps as well as with the Navy. The words &ldquo;and notwithstanding the provisions of section 14 of this Act,&rdquo; which are not now contained in title 34, are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;since the 6th day of April, 1917, has distinguished, or who, after July 2, 1926,&rdquo; are omitted as executed.</p>
