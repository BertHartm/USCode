<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary shall establish a policy permitting a particular acquisition position to be specified as available only to members of the armed forces if a determination is made, under criteria specified in the policy, that a member of the armed forces is required for that position by <!-- PDFPage:911 -->law, is essential for performance of the duties of the position, or is necessary for another compelling reason.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not later than December 15 of each year, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics shall submit to the Secretary a report that lists each acquisition position that is restricted to members of the armed forces under such policy and the recommendation of the Under Secretary as to whether such position should remain so restricted.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Assignments Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a policy on assigning military personnel to acquisition positions that provides for a balance between (A) the need for personnel to serve in career broadening positions, and (B) the need for requiring service in each such position for sufficient time to provide the stability necessary to effectively carry out the duties of the position and to allow for the establishment of responsibility and accountability for actions taken in the position.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In implementing the policy established under paragraph (1), the Secretaries of the military departments shall provide, as appropriate, for longer lengths of assignments to acquisition positions than assignments to other positions.</p>
