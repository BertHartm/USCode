<p class="statutory-body">(3) If at the time of any such valuation there has been a change in benefits under an education program described in subsection (b)(1) that has been made since the last such valuation and that increases or decreases the present value of benefits payable from the Fund, the Secretary of Defense shall determine an amortization methodology and schedule for the liquidation of the unfunded liability (or negative unfunded liability) thus created such that the present value of the sum of the amortization payments equals the increase or decrease in the present value of such benefits.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Based on the determinations under paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) the Secretary of Defense shall determine the amount needed to be appropriated to the Department of Defense and the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating for the next fiscal year for payments to be made to the Fund under subsection (g).

<p class="statutory-body">(6) All determinations under this subsection shall be made using methods and assumptions approved by the Board of Actuaries (including assumptions of interest rates and inflation) and in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and practices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating shall pay into the Fund each month the amount that, based upon the most recent actuarial valuation of the education programs described in subsection (b)(1), is equal to the actual total normal cost for the preceding month.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating shall pay into the Fund at the beginning of each fiscal year (or as soon thereafter as appropriations are available for such purpose) the sum of the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Amounts paid into the Fund under this subsection shall be paid from appropriations available for the pay of members of the armed forces under the jurisdiction of the Secretary concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest such portion of the Fund as is not in the judgment of the Secretary required to meet current withdrawals. Such investments shall be in public debt securities with maturities suitable to the needs of the Fund, as determined by the Sec<!-- PDFPage:883 -->retary, and bearing interest at rates determined by the Secretary, taking into consideration current market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities.
