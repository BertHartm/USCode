<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 90 days before the date on which the period of active duty is to commence under such order for that member.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Pharmacy Benefits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense, after consulting with the other administering Secretaries, shall establish an effective, efficient, integrated pharmacy benefits program under this chapter (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;pharmacy benefits program&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The pharmacy benefits program shall include a uniform formulary of pharmaceutical agents, which shall assure the availability of pharmaceutical agents in the complete range of therapeutic classes. The selection for inclusion on the uniform formulary of particular pharmaceutical agents in each therapeutic class shall be based on the relative clinical and cost effectiveness of the agents in such class.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In considering the relative clinical effectiveness of agents under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall presume inclusion in a therapeutic class of a pharmaceutical agent, unless the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee established under subsection (b) finds that a pharmaceutical agent does not have a significant, clinically meaningful therapeutic advantage in terms of safety, effectiveness, or clinical outcome over the other drugs included on the uniform formulary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In considering the relative cost effectiveness of agents under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall rely on the evaluation by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee of the costs of agents in a therapeutic class in relation to the safety, effectiveness, and clinical outcomes of such agents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary shall establish procedures for the selection of particular pharmaceutical agents for the uniform formulary. Such procedures shall be established so as best to accomplish, in the judgment of the Secretary, the objectives set forth in paragraph (1). No pharmaceutical agent may be excluded from the uniform formulary except upon the recommendation of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. The Secretary shall begin to implement the uniform formulary not later than October 1, 2000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Pharmaceutical agents included on the uniform formulary shall be available to eligible covered beneficiaries through&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) facilities of the uniformed services, consistent with the scope of health care services offered in such facilities and additional determinations by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee of the relative clinical and cost effectiveness of the agents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) retail pharmacies designated or eligible under the TRICARE program or the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services to provide pharmaceutical agents to covered beneficiaries; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the national mail-order pharmacy program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The pharmacy benefits program shall assure the availability of clinically appropriate pharmaceutical agents to members of the armed forces, including, where appropriate, agents not included on the uniform formulary described in paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The pharmacy benefits program may provide that prior authorization be required for certain pharmaceutical agents to assure that the use of such agents is clinically appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The pharmacy benefits program shall assure the availability to eligible covered beneficiaries of pharmaceutical agents not included on the uniform formulary. Such pharmaceutical agents shall be available through at least one of the means described in paragraph (2)(E) under terms and conditions that may include cost sharing by the eligible covered beneficiary in addition to any such cost sharing applicable to agents on the uniform formulary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) The Secretary, in the regulations prescribed under subsection (g), may establish cost sharing requirements (which may be established as a percentage or fixed dollar amount) under the pharmacy benefits program for generic, formulary, and nonformulary agents. For nonformulary agents, cost sharing shall be consistent with common industry practice and not in excess of amounts generally comparable to 20 percent for beneficiaries covered by section 1079 of <!-- PDFPage:521 -->this title or 25 percent for beneficiaries covered by section 1086 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For a medicare-eligible beneficiary, the cost-sharing requirements may not be in excess of the cost-sharing requirements applicable to all other beneficiaries covered by section 1086 of this title. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a medicare-eligible beneficiary is a beneficiary eligible for health benefits under section 1086 of this title pursuant to subsection (d)(2) of such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary shall establish procedures for eligible covered beneficiaries to receive pharmaceutical agents that are not included on the uniform formulary but that are considered to be clinically necessary. Such procedures shall include peer review procedures under which the Secretary may determine that there is a clinical justification for the use of a pharmaceutical agent that is not on the uniform formulary, in which case the pharmaceutical agent shall be provided under the same terms and conditions as an agent on the uniform formulary. Such procedures shall also include an expeditious appeals process for an eligible covered beneficiary, or a network or uniformed provider on behalf of the beneficiary, to establish clinical justification for the use of a pharmaceutical agent that is not on the uniform formulary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall ensure that an eligible covered beneficiary may continue to receive coverage for any maintenance pharmaceutical that is not on the uniform formulary and that was prescribed for the beneficiary before October 5, 1999, and stabilized the medical condition of the beneficiary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Establishment of Committee</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall, in consultation with the Secretaries of the military departments, establish a Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee for the purpose of developing the uniform formulary of pharmaceutical agents required by subsection (a), reviewing such formulary on a periodic basis, and making additional recommendations regarding the formulary as the committee determines necessary and appropriate. The committee shall include representatives of pharmacies of the uniformed services facilities and representatives of providers in facilities of the uniformed services. Committee members shall have expertise in treating the medical needs of the populations served through such entities and in the range of pharmaceutical and biological medicines available for treating such populations. The committee shall function under procedures established by the Secretary under the regulations prescribed under subsection (g).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 90 days after the establishment of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee by the Secretary, the committee shall convene to design a proposed uniform formulary for submission to the Secretary. After such 90-day period, the committee shall meet at least quarterly and shall, during meetings, consider for inclusion on the uniform formulary under the standards established in subsection (a) any drugs newly approved by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Advisory Panel</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Concurrent with the establishment of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee under subsection (b), the Secretary shall establish a Uniform Formulary Beneficiary Advisory Panel to review and comment on the development of the uniform formulary. The Secretary shall consider the comments of the panel before implementing the uniform formulary or implementing changes to the uniform formulary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall determine the size and membership of the panel established under paragraph (1), which shall include members that represent&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) nongovernmental organizations and associations that represent the views and interests of a large number of eligible covered beneficiaries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) contractors responsible for the TRICARE retail pharmacy program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) contractors responsible for the national mail-order pharmacy program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) TRICARE network providers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In the operation of the pharmacy benefits program under subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense shall assure through management and new contractual arrangements that financial resources are aligned such that the cost of prescriptions is borne by the organization that is financially responsible for the health care of the eligible covered beneficiary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Effective not later than April 5, 2000, the Secretary shall use a modification to the bid price adjustment methodology in the current managed care support contracts to ensure equitable and timely reimbursement to the TRICARE managed care support contractors for pharmaceutical products delivered in the nonmilitary environments. The methodology shall take into account the &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; nature of the contracts as well as managed care support contractor pharmacy costs attributable to changes to pharmacy service or formulary management at military medical treatment facilities, and other military activities and policies that affect costs of pharmacy benefits provided through the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services. The methodology shall also account for military treatment facility costs attributable to the delivery of pharmaceutical products in the military facility environment which were prescribed by a network provider.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Pharmacy Data Transaction Service</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall implement the use of the Pharmacy Data Transaction Service in all fixed facilities of the uniformed services under the jurisdiction of the Secretary, in the TRICARE retail pharmacy program, and in the national mail-order pharmacy program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;eligible covered beneficiary&rdquo; means a covered beneficiary for whom eligibility to receive pharmacy benefits through the means described in subsection (a)(2)(E) is established under this chapter or another provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;pharmaceutical agent&rdquo; means drugs, biological products, and medical devices under the regulatory authority of the Food and Drug Administration.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Eligibility</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A member of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve of a reserve component of the armed forces is eligible for health benefits under TRICARE Standard as provided in this section after the member completes service on active duty to which the member was called or ordered for a period of more than 30 days on or after September 11, 2001, under a provision of law referred to in section 101(a)(13)(B), if the member&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) served continuously on active duty for 90 or more days pursuant to such call or order; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) not later than 90 days after release from such active-duty service, entered into an agreement with the Secretary concerned to serve continuously in the Selected Reserve for a period of one or more whole years following such date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Period of Coverage</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) TRICARE Standard coverage of a member under this section, on the basis of active-duty service performed as described in subsection (a), begins upon the expiration of the member's entitlement to care and benefits under section 1145(a) of this title that is based on the same active-duty service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to paragraph (3) and unless earlier terminated under paragraph (4), the period for TRICARE Standard coverage of a member under this section shall be equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) one year, in the case of a member who is otherwise eligible but does not serve continuously on active duty for 90 days as described in subsection (a) because of an injury, illness, or disease incurred or aggravated while deployed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) one year for each consecutive period of 90 days of continuous active-duty service described in subsection (a); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the number of whole years for which the member agrees under paragraph (2) of such subsection to continue to serve in the Selected Reserve after the coverage begins.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of a member recalled to active duty before the period of coverage for which the member is eligible under subsection (a) terminates, the period of coverage of the member&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) resumes after the member completes the subsequent active duty service (subject to any additional entitlement to care and benefits under section 1145(a) of this title that is based on the same subsequent active duty service); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) increases by any additional period of coverage for which the member is eligible under subsection (a) based on the subsequent active duty service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Eligibility for TRICARE Standard coverage of a member under this section shall terminate upon the termination of the member's service in the Selected Reserve.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the case of a member of the Individual Ready Reserve who is unable to find a position in the Selected Reserve and who meets the requirements for eligibility for health benefits under TRICARE Standard under subsection (a) except for membership in the Selected Reserve, the period of coverage under this section may begin not later than one year after coverage would otherwise begin under this section had the member been a member of the Selected Reserve, if the member finds a position in the Selected Reserve during that one-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Family Members</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;While a member of a reserve component is covered by TRICARE Standard under the section, the members of the immediate family of such member are eligible for TRICARE Standard coverage as dependents of the member. If a member of a reserve component dies while in a period of coverage under this section, the eligibility of the members of the immediate family of such member for TRICARE Standard coverage shall continue for six months beyond the date of death of the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Premiums</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A member of a reserve component covered by TRICARE Standard under this section shall pay a premium for that coverage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe for the purposes of this section one premium for TRICARE Standard coverage of members without dependents and one premium for TRICARE Standard coverage of members with dependents referred to in subsection (f)(1). The premium prescribed for a coverage shall apply uniformly to all covered members of the reserve components.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The monthly amount of the premium in effect for a month for TRICARE Standard cov<!-- PDFPage:534 -->erage under this section shall be the amount equal to 28 percent of the total monthly amount that the Secretary determines on an appropriate actuarial basis as being reasonable for that coverage.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to any continuation of eligibility for benefits under paragraph (1), when a member dies while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days, the member's dependents who are receiving benefits under a plan covered by subsection (a) shall continue to be eligible for benefits under TRICARE Prime during the three-year period beginning on the date of the member's death, except that, in the case of such a dependent of the deceased who is described by subparagraph (D) or (I) of section 1072(2) of this title, the period of continued eligibility shall be the longer of the following periods beginning on such date:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Three years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The period ending on the date on which such dependent attains 21 years of age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) In the case of such a dependent who, at 21 years of age, is enrolled in a full-time course of study in a secondary school or in a full-time course of study in an institution of higher education approved by the administering Secretary and was, at the time of the member's death, in fact dependent on the member for over one-half of such dependent's support, the period ending on the earlier of the following dates:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) The terms and conditions under which health benefits are provided under this chapter to a dependent of a deceased member under paragraph (2) shall be the same as those that would apply to the dependent under this chapter if the member were living and serving on active duty for a period of more than 30 days.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:543 --><p class="statutory-body">(5) In this subsection, the term &ldquo;TRICARE Prime&rdquo; means the managed care option of the TRICARE program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), payment for a charge for services by an individual health care professional (or other noninstitutional health care provider) for which a claim is submitted under a plan contracted for under subsection (a) shall be equal to an amount determined to be appropriate, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the same reimbursement rules as apply to payments for similar services under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.). The Secretary of Defense shall determine the appropriate payment amount under this paragraph in consultation with the other administering Secretaries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, shall prescribe regulations to provide for such exceptions to the payment limitations under paragraph (1) as the Secretary determines to be necessary to assure that covered beneficiaries retain adequate access to health care services. Such exceptions may include the payment of amounts higher than the amount allowed under paragraph (1) when enrollees in managed care programs obtain covered services from nonparticipating providers. To provide a suitable transition from the payment methodologies in effect before February 10, 1996, to the methodology required by paragraph (1), the amount allowable for any service may not be reduced by more than 15 percent below the amount allowed for the same service during the immediately preceding 12-month period (or other period as established by the Secretary of Defense).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In addition to the authority provided under paragraph (2), the Secretary of Defense may authorize the commander of a facility of the uniformed services, the lead agent (if other than the commander), and the health care contractor to modify the payment limitations under paragraph (1) for certain health care providers when necessary to ensure both the availability of certain services for covered beneficiaries and lower costs than would otherwise be incurred to provide the services. With the consent of the health care provider, the Secretary is also authorized to reduce the authorized payment for certain health care services below the amount otherwise required by the payment limitations under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, shall prescribe regulations to establish limitations (similar to the limitations established under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.)) on beneficiary liability for charges of an individual health care professional (or other noninstitutional health care provider).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The regulations shall include a restriction that prohibits an individual health care professional (or other noninstitutional health care provider) from billing a beneficiary for services for more than the amount that is equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the excess of the limiting charge (as defined in section 1848(g)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w&ndash;4(g)(2))) that would be applicable if the services had been provided by the professional (or other provider) as an individual health care professional (or other noninstitutional health care provider) on a nonassignment-related basis under part B of title XVIII of such Act over the amount that is payable by the United States for those services under this subsection, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any unpaid amounts of deductibles or copayments that are payable directly to the professional (or other provider) by the beneficiary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) In the case of a dependent described in clause (ii), the regulations shall provide that, in addition to amounts otherwise payable by the United States, the Secretary may pay the amount referred to in subparagraph (B)(i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) This subparagraph applies to a dependent referred to in subsection (a) of a member of a reserve component serving on active duty pursuant to a call or order to active duty for a period of more than 30 days in support of a contingency operation under a provision of law referred to in section 101(a)(13)(B) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) To assure access to care for all covered beneficiaries, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, shall designate specific rates for reimbursement for services in certain localities if the Secretary determines that without payment of such rates access to health care services would be severely impaired. Such a determination shall be based on consideration of the number of providers in a locality who provide the services, the number of such providers who are CHAMPUS participating providers, the number of covered beneficiaries under CHAMPUS in the locality, the availability of military providers in the location or a nearby location, and any other factors determined to be relevant by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) The limitation in subsection (a)(6) does not apply in the case of inpatient mental health services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provided under the program for the handicapped under subsection (d);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provided as partial hospital care; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provided pursuant to a waiver authorized by the Secretary of Defense because of medical or psychological circumstances of the patient that are confirmed by a health professional who is not a Federal employee after a review, pursuant to rules prescribed by the Secretary, which takes into account the appropriate level of care for the patient, the intensity of services required by the patient, and the availability of that care.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding subsection (b) or section 1086(b) of this title, the Secretary of Defense (after consulting with the other administering Secretaries) may prescribe separate payment requirements (including deductibles, copayments, and catastrophic limits) for the provision of mental health services to persons covered by this section or section 1086 of this title. The payment requirements may vary for different categories of covered beneficiaries, by type of mental health service provided, and based on the location of the covered beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Secretary of Defense shall require preadmission authorization before inpatient mental health services may be provided to persons cov<!-- PDFPage:544 -->ered by this section or section 1086 of this title. In the case of the provision of emergency inpatient mental health services, approval for the continuation of such services shall be required within 72 hours after admission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount to be paid to a provider of services for services provided under a plan covered by this section shall be determined under joint regulations to be prescribed by the administering Secretaries which provide that the amount of such payments shall be determined to the extent practicable in accordance with the same reimbursement rules as apply to payments to providers of services of the same type under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A contract for a plan covered by this section shall include a clause that prohibits each provider of services under the plan from billing any person covered by the plan for any balance of charges for services in excess of the amount paid for those services under the joint regulations referred to in paragraph (2), except for any unpaid amounts of deductibles or copayments that are payable directly to the provider by the person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In this subsection, the term &ldquo;provider of services&rdquo; means a hospital, skilled nursing facility, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility, home health agency, hospice program (as defined in section 1861(dd)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(dd)(2))), or other institutional facility providing services for which payment may be made under a plan covered by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) A plan covered by this section may include provision of liver transplants (including the cost of acquisition and transportation of the donated liver) in accordance with this subsection. Such a liver transplant may be provided if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the transplant is for a dependent considered appropriate for that procedure by the Secretary of Defense in consultation with the other administering Secretaries and such other entities as the Secretary considers appropriate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the transplant is to be carried out at a health-care facility that has been approved for that purpose by the Secretary of Defense after consultation with the other administering Secretaries and such other entities as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>)(1) Contracts entered into under subsection (a) shall also provide for medical care for dependents of former members of the uniformed services who are authorized to receive medical and dental care under section 1076(e) of this title in facilities of the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), medical care in the case of a dependent described in section 1076(e) shall be furnished under the same conditions and subject to the same limitations as medical care furnished under this section to spouses and children of members of the uniformed services described in the first sentence of subsection (a).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A payment under paragraph (1) may not exceed the average amount paid for comparable services in the geographic area in which the hospital is located or, if no comparable services are available in that area, in an area similar to the area in which the hospital is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Defense shall periodically review the billing practices of each hospital the Secretary approves for payment under this subsection to ensure that the hospital's practices of not billing patients for payment are not resulting in increased costs to the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of Defense may require each hospital the Secretary approves for payment under this subsection to provide evidence that it has sources of revenue to cover unbilled costs.</p>

If the insurance, medical service, or health plan of that payer includes a requirement for a deductible or copayment by the beneficiary of the plan, then the amount that the United States may collect from the third-party payer is a reasonable charge for the care provided less the appropriate deductible or copayment amount.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) No provision of any insurance, medical service, or health plan contract or agreement having the effect of excluding from coverage or limiting payment of charges for certain care shall operate to prevent collection by the United States under subsection (a) if that care is provided&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), and except as provided in subsection (j), collection may not be made under this section in the case of a plan administered under title XVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, shall prescribe regulations for the administration of this section.

Such term also includes entities described in subsection (j) under the terms and to the extent provided in such subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;insurance, medical service, or health plan&rdquo; includes a preferred provider organization, an insurance plan described as Medicare supplemental insurance, and a personal injury protection plan or medical payments benefit plan for personal injuries resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In cases in which a tort liability is created upon some third person, collection from a third-party payer that is an automobile liability insurance carrier shall be governed by the provisions of Public Law 87&ndash;693 (42 U.S.C. 2651 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) The Secretary of Defense may enter into an agreement with any health maintenance organization, competitive medical plan, health care prepayment plan, or other similar plan (pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary) providing for collection under this section from such organization or plan for services provided to a covered beneficiary who is an enrollee in such organization or plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) To improve the administration of this section and sections 1079(j)(1) and 1086(d) of this title, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, may prescribe regulations providing for the collection of information regarding insurance, medical service, or health plans of third-party payers held by covered beneficiaries.</p>

The Secretary may provide for obtaining from the Commissioner of Social Security employment information comparable to the information provided to the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services pursuant to such section. Such regulations may require the mandatory disclosure of Social Security account numbers for all covered beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may disclose relevant employment information collected under this subsection to fiscal intermediaries or other designated contractors.</p>

However, in the event that the Secretary considers a product to represent the most appropriate countermeasure for diseases endemic to the area of operations or to protect against possible chemical, biological, or radiological weapons, but the product has not yet been approved by the FDA for its intended use, the product may, under certain circumstances and strict controls, be administered to provide potential protection for the health and well-being of deployed military personnel in order to ensure the success of the military operation. The provisions of 21 CFR Part 312 contain the FDA requirements for investigational new drugs.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Informed Consent Requirements and Waiver Provisions.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Before administering an investigational drug to members of the Armed Forces, the Department of Defense (DoD) must obtain informed consent from each individual unless the Secretary can justify to the President a need for a waiver of informed consent in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1107(f). Waivers of informed consent will be granted only when absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1107(f), the President may waive the informed consent requirement for the administration of an investigational drug to a member of the Armed Forces in connection with the member's participation in a particular military operation, upon a written determination by the President that obtaining consent:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) is not feasible;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) is contrary to the best interests of the member; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) is not in the interests of national security.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) In making a determination to waive the informed consent requirement on a ground described in subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the President is required by law to apply the standards and criteria set forth in the relevant FDA regulations, 21 CFR 50.23(d). In determining a waiver based on subsection (b)(3) of this section, the President will also consider the standards and criteria of the relevant FDA regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The Secretary may request that the President waive the informed consent requirement with respect to the administration of an investigational drug. The Secretary may not delegate the authority to make this waiver request. At a minimum, the waiver request shall contain:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) A full description of the threat, including the potential for exposure. If the threat is a chemical, biological, or radiological weapon, the waiver request shall contain an analysis of the probability the weapon will be used, the method or methods of delivery, and the likely magnitude of its affect on an exposed individual.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) Documentation that the Secretary has complied with 21 CFR 50.23(d). This documentation shall include:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(A) A statement that certifies and a written justification that documents that each of the criteria and standards set forth in 21 CFR 50.23(d) has been met; or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(B) If the Secretary finds it highly impracticable to certify that the criteria and standards set forth in 21 CFR 50.23(d) have been fully met because doing so would significantly impair the Secretary's ability to carry out the particular military mission, a written justification that documents which criteria and standards have or have not been met, explains the reasons for failing to meet any of the criteria and standards, and provides additional justification why a waiver should be granted solely in the interests of national security.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) Any additional information pertinent to the Secretary's determination, including the minutes of the Institutional Review Board's (IRB) deliberations and the IRB members&rsquo; voting record.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The Secretary shall develop the waiver request in consultation with the FDA.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) The Secretary shall submit the waiver request to the President and provide a copy to the Commissioner of the FDA (Commissioner).</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) The Commissioner shall expeditiously review the waiver request and certify to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (APNSA) and the Assistant to the President for Science and Tech<!-- PDFPage:588 -->nology (APST) whether the standards and criteria of the relevant FDA regulations have been adequately addressed and whether the investigational new drug protocol may proceed subject to a decision by the President on the informed consent waiver request. FDA shall base its decision on, and the certification shall include an analysis describing, the extent and strength of the evidence on the safety and effectiveness of the investigational new drug in relation to the medical risk that could be encountered during the military operation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) The APNSA and APST will prepare a joint advisory opinion as to whether the waiver of informed consent should be granted and will forward it, along with the waiver request and the FDA certification to the President.</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) The President will approve or deny the waiver request and will provide written notification of the decision to the Secretary and the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Required Action After Waiver is Issued</em>. (a) Following a Presidential waiver under 10 U.S.C. 1107(f), the DoD offices responsible for implementing the waiver, DoD's Office of the Inspector General, and the FDA, consistent with its regulatory role, will conduct an ongoing review and monitoring to assess adherence to the standards and criteria under 21 CFR 50.23(d) and this order. The responsible DoD offices shall also adhere to any periodic reporting requirements specified by the President at the time of the waiver approval. The Secretary shall submit the findings to the President and provide a copy to the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary shall, as soon as practicable, make the congressional notifications required by 10 U.S.C. 1107(f)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Secretary shall, as soon as practicable and consistent with classification requirements, issue a public notice in the Federal Register describing each waiver of informed consent determination and a summary of the most updated scientific information on the products used, as well as other information the President determines is appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The waiver will expire at the end of 1 year (or an alternative time period not to exceed 1 year, specified by the President at the time of approval), or when the Secretary informs the President that the particular military operation creating the need for the use of the investigational drug has ended, whichever is earlier. The President may revoke the waiver based on changed circumstances or for any other reason. If the Secretary seeks to renew a waiver prior to its expiration, the Secretary must submit to the President an updated request, specifically identifying any new information available relevant to the standards and criteria under 21 CFR 50.23(d). To request to renew a waiver, the Secretary must satisfy the criteria for a waiver as described in section 3 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The Secretary shall notify the President and the Commissioner if the threat countered by the investigational drug changes significantly or if significant new information on the investigational drug is received.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Training for Military Personnel</em>. (a) The DoD shall provide ongoing training and health risk communication on the requirements of using an investigational drug in support of a military operation to all military personnel, including those in leadership positions, during chemical and biological warfare defense training and other training, as appropriate. This ongoing training and health risk communication shall include general information about 10 U.S.C. 1107 and 21 CFR 50.23(d).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) If the President grants a waiver under 10 U.S.C. 1107(f), the DoD shall provide training to all military personnel conducting the waiver protocol and health risk communication to all military personnel receiving the specific investigational drug to be administered prior to its use.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Secretary shall submit the training and health risk communication plans as part of the investigational new drug protocol submission to the FDA and the reviewing IRB. Training and health risk communication shall include at a minimum:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) The basis for any determination by the President that informed consent is not or may not be feasible;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) The means for tracking use and adverse effects of the investigational drug;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) The benefits and risks of using the investigational drug; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(4) A statement that the investigational drug is not approved (or not approved for the intended use).</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The DoD shall keep operational commanders informed of the overall requirements of successful protocol execution and their role, with the support of medical personnel, in ensuring successful execution of the protocol.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Scope</em>. (a) This order applies to the consideration and Presidential approval of a waiver of informed consent under 10 U.S.C. 1107 and does not apply to other FDA regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the Federal Government. Nothing contained in this order shall create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by any party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The waiver authority provided in subparagraph (A) shall not be construed to apply to any case other than a case in which an individual is required to be informed of an option to accept or refuse administration of a particular product by reason of a determination by the Secretary of Health and Human Services that emergency use of such product is authorized under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</p>
