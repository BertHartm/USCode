<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;rank&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;take precedence&rdquo; throughout the section for uniformity of expression.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the first sentence is broadened to include officers of the Marine Corps and officers not on a lineal list. Inclusion of the Marine Corps is possible because the sentence reflects the rule referred to by the Attorney General (25 Op. Atty. Gen. 517) as &ldquo;an unwritten law of the Army and Navy&rdquo; as to relative rank between officers in different services. Officers not on a lineal list may properly be included since the statement is consistent with the provisions for assigning lineal position to such officers when they become entitled to be placed on a list.</p>
