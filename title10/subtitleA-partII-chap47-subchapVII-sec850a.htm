<p class="statutory-body">(a) It is an affirmative defense in a trial by court-martial that, at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the accused, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of the acts. Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:282 --><p class="statutory-body">(b) The accused has the burden of proving the defense of lack of mental responsibility by clear and convincing evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Whenever lack of mental responsibility of the accused with respect to an offense is properly at issue, the military judge, or the president of a court-martial without a military judge, shall instruct the members of the court as to the defense of lack of mental responsibility under this section and charge them to find the accused&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) guilty;</p>
