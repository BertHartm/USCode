<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall be for the purpose of compensating a developer for any costs resulting from the termination of the lease during the construction of the housing units that are to be occupied pursuant to the lease;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may be for a period not in excess of three years; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for foreign currency fluctuations from October 1, 1987; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) at the beginning of each fiscal year, by the percentage (if any) by which the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, during the preceding fiscal year exceeds such Consumer Price Index for the fiscal year before such preceding fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
