<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide incentives for commercial air passenger carriers to provide newer, more efficient and reliable aircraft for Department of Defense service rather than older, fully depreciated aircraft.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Consideration of Recommendations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense shall consider the recommendations on courses of action for the Civil Reserve Air Fleet as outlined in the report required by section 1356 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008&nbsp;<sup><a href="#9515_1_target" name="9515_1">1</a></sup> (Public Law 110&ndash;181).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any amounts required to be transferred under paragraph (1) shall be transferred by the last day of the fiscal year concerned to meet the requirements of subsection (g) unless minimum purchase amounts have already been distributed by the Secretary of Defense under subsection (g) as of that date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Availability of Airlift Services</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) From the total amount of charter air transportation services available for a fiscal year under all contracts awarded under subsection (c) for such fiscal year, a military department shall be entitled to obtain a percentage of such services equal to the percentage of the contribution of the military department to the transportation working capital fund for such fiscal year under subsection (h).</p>
