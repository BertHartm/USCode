<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) If a certification referred to in subsection (b) with respect to a shipbuilding contract is determined to be deficient because of the position, status, or scope of authority of the person executing the certification, the contractor may resubmit the certification. The resub<!-- PDFPage:780 -->mitted certification shall be based on the knowledge of the contractor and the supporting data that existed when the original certification was submitted. The appropriateness of the person executing the resubmitted certification shall be determined on the basis of applicable law in effect at the time of the resubmission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a certification is resubmitted pursuant to paragraph (1) by the date described in paragraph (3), the resubmitted certification shall be deemed to have been submitted for purposes of this section at the time the original certification was submitted.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a board of contract appeals issues a decision determining the previously submitted claim, request, or demand to be deficient; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) a Federal court renders a judgment determining the previously submitted claim, request, or demand to be deficient.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This subsection applies only with respect to a claim, request, or demand submitted before the effective date of this paragraph.</p>
