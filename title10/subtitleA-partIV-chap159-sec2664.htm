<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the introductory clause is substituted for 50:172 (1st 25 words, and 2d sentence). The words &ldquo;Secretary of Commerce&rdquo; and &ldquo;Chairman of the Federal Maritime Board&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;Chairman of the United States Maritime Commission&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;functions transferred to the Secretary of Commerce or the Federal Maritime Board by 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 21, effective May 24, 1950, 64 Stat. 1273&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;[functions of] the United States Maritime Commission&rdquo;, since the functions of the Chairman of the United States Maritime Commission and of the United States Maritime Commission were transferred to the Secretary of Commerce and the Federal Maritime Board by that Reorganization Plan. The words &ldquo;or any one or more of them&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;individually or collectively&rdquo;, to make it clear that any number of them may act and not necessarily one or all of them. The words &ldquo;equipment for them&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;their apparel or furniture&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;manufacture, or building&rdquo; are omitted as covered by the word &ldquo;production&rdquo;. 50:172 (1st 18 words of 3d sentence) is omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2), the word &ldquo;supplies&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;materials and equipment&rdquo;, since the word &ldquo;supplies&rdquo; is defined in section 101(26) of this title to include material and equipment.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last sentence of subsection (a) is based on the 27 words preceding the first proviso of 50:171, which is the source for section 2663(a) (last sentence) of this title, and which was incorporated into 50:172 by the cross reference in the first sentence thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the introductory clause is inserted for clarity. The words &ldquo;equipment, materials&rdquo; are omitted as covered by the word &ldquo;supplies&rdquo;, since the word &ldquo;supplies&rdquo; is defined in section 101(26) of this title to include material and equipment.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;United States District Court for the district in which&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;district courts of the United States, where&rdquo; to conform to section 132 of title 28.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsections (d)&ndash;(f) are based on the provisos of 50:171, which are the source for section 2663(b)&ndash;(d) of this title, and which were incorporated into 50:172 by the cross reference in the first sentence thereof.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1958 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">The deletion of the last sentence of section 2663(a) and the last sentence of section 2664(a) reflects their implied repeal by Rule 71A of the Rules of Civil Procedure for the United States District Courts (see 28 U.S.C. 2072). (See letter from Assistant Attorney General (Lands Division), Department of Justice, August 1957, to General Counsel, Department of Defense.) The other changes conform section 2664 to section 2663, both of which were based on the same source statute (sec. 8 of the Act of July 9, 1918, ch. 143, subch. XV, 40 Stat. 888) and both of which include the temporary use of the kinds of property respectively covered.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">1982 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">This corrects an error in an amendment to 10:2664(a) made by section 12(3)(A) of the Maritime Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 97&ndash;31, Aug. 6, 1981, 95 Stat. 153).</p>

L. 97&ndash;295 substituted &ldquo;military department, the Secretary of Transportation, or any&rdquo; for &ldquo;military department&rdquo; and all that followed through &ldquo;or any&rdquo; in text preceding par. (1), substituted &ldquo;transferred to the Secretary of Transportation&rdquo; for &ldquo;transferred to the&rdquo; and all that followed in par. (3), clarifying the ambiguity created by the conflicting language of Pub. L. 96&ndash;513 and Pub. L. 97&ndash;31, and inserted reference to section 3 of the Maritime Act of 1981 (46 U.S.C. 1602).</p>

L. 96&ndash;513 substituted &ldquo;Federal Maritime Commission&rdquo; for &ldquo;Federal Maritime Board&rdquo; in two places, and substituted &ldquo;under Reorganization Plan No. 7 of 1961, effective August 12, 1961 (75 Stat. 840)&rdquo; for &ldquo;by 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 21, effective May 24, 1950 (64 Stat. 1273)&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">1958&mdash;Subsec. (a). Pub.
