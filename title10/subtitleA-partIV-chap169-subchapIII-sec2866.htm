<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Water Conservation Activities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall permit and encourage each military department, Defense Agency, and other instrumentality of the Department of Defense to participate in programs conducted by a utility for the management of water demand or for water conservation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense may authorize a military installation to accept a financial incentive (including an agreement to reduce the <!-- PDFPage:1011 -->amount of a future water bill), goods, or services generally available from a utility, for the purpose of adopting technologies and practices that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) relate to the management of water demand or to water conservation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) as determined by the Secretary, are cost effective for the Federal Government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Subject to paragraph (4), the Secretary of Defense may authorize the Secretary of a military department having jurisdiction over a military installation to enter into an agreement with a utility to design and implement a cost-effective program that provides incentives for the management of water demand and for water conservation and that addresses the requirements and circumstances of the installation. Activities under the program may include the provision of water management services, the alteration of a facility, and the installation and maintenance by the utility of a water-saving device or technology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If an agreement under paragraph (3) provides for a utility to pay in advance the financing costs for the design or implementation of a program referred to in that paragraph and for such advance payment to be repayed by the United States, the cost of such advance payment may be recovered by the utility under terms that are not less favorable than the terms applicable to the most favored customer of the utility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subject to the availability of appropriations, a repayment of an advance payment under subparagraph (A) shall be made from funds available to a military department for the purchase of utility services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) An agreement under paragraph (3) shall provide that title to a water-saving device or technology installed at a military installation pursuant to the agreement shall vest in the United States. Such title may vest at such time during the term of the agreement, or upon expiration of the agreement, as determined to be in the best interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Use of Water Cost Savings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Water cost savings realized under this section shall be used as provided in section 2865(b)(2) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Water Conservation Construction Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense may carry out a military construction project for water conservation, not previously authorized, using funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the Secretary for water conservation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When a decision is made to carry out a project under paragraph (1), the Secretary of Defense shall notify the Committees on Armed Services and Appropriations of the Senate and House of Representatives of that decision. Such project may be carried out only after the end of the 21-day period beginning on the date the notification is received by such committees.</p>
