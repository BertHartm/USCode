<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If an agreement under paragraph (3) provides for a utility to pay in advance the financing costs for the design or implementation of a program referred to in that paragraph and for such advance payment to be repayed by the United States, the cost of such advance payment may be recovered by the utility under terms that are not less favorable than the terms applicable to the most favored customer of the utility.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Water cost savings realized under subsection (a)(3) shall be used as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) One-half of the amount shall be used for water conservation activities at such buildings, facilities, or installations of the Department of Defense as may be designated (in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense) by the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality that realized the water cost savings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) One-half of the amount shall be used at the installation at which the savings were realized, as determined by the commanding officer of such installation consistent with applicable law and regulations, for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) improvements to existing military family housing units;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) any unspecified minor construction project that will enhance the quality of life of personnel; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) any morale, welfare, or recreation facility or service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(2) When a decision is made to carry out a project under paragraph (1), the Secretary of Defense shall notify the appropriate committees of Congress of that decision. Such project may be carried out only after the end of the 21-day period beginning on the date the notification is received by such committees or, if earlier, the end of the 14-day period beginning on the date on which a copy of the notification is provided in an electronic medium pursuant to section 480 of this title.</p>
