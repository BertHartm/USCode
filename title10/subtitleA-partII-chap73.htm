<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1431. Election of annuity: members of armed forces</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) This section applies to all members of the armed forces except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) members whose names are on a retired list other than a list maintained under section 12774(a) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) cadets at the United States Military Academy, the United States Air Force Academy, or the Coast Guard Academy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) midshipmen.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) To provide an annuity under section 1434 of this title, a person covered by subsection (a) may elect to receive a reduced amount of the retired pay or retainer pay to which he may become entitled as a result of service in his armed force. Except as otherwise provided in this section, unless it is made before he completes nineteen years of service for which he is entitled to credit in the computation of his basic pay, the election must be made at least two years before the first day for which retired pay or retainer pay is granted. However, if, because of military operations, a member is assigned to an isolated station or is missing, interned in a neutral country, captured by a hostile force, or beleaguered or besieged, and for that reason is unable to make an election before completing nineteen years of that service, he may make the election, to become effective immediately, within one year after he ceases to be assigned to that station or returns to the jurisdiction of his armed force, as the case may be. A member to whom retired pay or retainer pay is granted retroactively, and who is otherwise eligible to make an election, may make the election within ninety days after receiving notice that such pay has been granted to him. An election made after August 13, 1968, is not effective if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the elector dies during the first thirty-day period he is entitled to retired pay as a result of a physical condition which led to his being granted retired pay under chapter 61 of title 10 with a disability of 100 per centum under the standard schedule of rating disabilities in use by the Department of Veterans Affairs at the time of the determination of the per centum of his disability;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the disability was not the result of injury or disease received in line of duty as a direct result of armed conflict; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) his surviving spouse or children are entitled to dependency and indemnity compensation under chapter 13 of title 38 based upon his death.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) An election may be changed or revoked by the elector before the first day for which retired or retainer pay is granted. Unless it is made on the basis of restored mental competency under section 1433 of this title, or unless it is made before the elector completes nineteen years of service for which he is entitled to credit in the computation of his basic pay (in which case only the latest change or revocation shall be effective), the change or revocation is not effective if it is made less than two years before the first day for which retired or retainer pay is granted. The elector may, however, before the first day for which retired or retainer pay is granted, change or revoke his election (provided the change does not increase the amount of the annuity elected) to reflect a change in the marital or dependency status of the member or his family that is caused by death, divorce, annulment, <!-- PDFPage:630 -->remarriage, or acquisition of a child, if such change or revocation of election is made within two years of such change in marital or dependency status.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If an election made under this section is found to be void for any reason except fraud or willful intent of the member making the election, he may make a corrected election at any time within 90 days after he is notified in writing that the election is void. A corrected election made under this subsection is effective as of the date of the voided election it replaces.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the language of the revised subsection is substituted for 37:371(b) and (c), to make clear that the section was intended to include enlisted members and members of the Army, or the Air Force, without component. The words &ldquo;the United States Air Force Academy&rdquo; are inserted to reflect its establishment by the Air Force Academy Act (68 Stat. 47). The words &ldquo;retirement pay&rdquo; are omitted as covered by the words &ldquo;retired pay&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;equivalent pay&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. 37:371(c) (less 1st 21 words) is omitted as executed, since the persons described must have completed 18 years of the required service on the effective date of the source statute and exercised the option by 180 days after that date. 37:371(a) is omitted, since the revised chapter applies only to the armed forces. 37:371(d) is omitted, since the words &ldquo;person entitled to retired or retainer pay&rdquo;, or their equivalent, are used throughout the revised chapter. 37:371(g) is omitted, since the words &ldquo;retired or retainer pay&rdquo; are used throughout the revised chapter. 37:371(h) is omitted as unnecessary in view of the definitions contained in section 101(5), (7), and (8). 37:372(a) (2d sentence) is omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), 37:372(a) (last 28 words of 1st sentence) is omitted as covered by section 1434 of this title. The words &ldquo;or naval&rdquo; are omitted as covered by the word &ldquo;military&rdquo;. The last sentence is substituted for 37:372(a) (4th sentence, less 61st through 81st words). 37:372(a) (3d sentence, and 61st through 85th words of 4th sentence) and 37:372(b) (less last sentence) are omitted as executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;is retired or becomes entitled to retired or retainer pay&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;his retirement&rdquo; and &ldquo;he retires&rdquo; since, under sections 1331&ndash;1333 of this title, a person may be granted retired pay without having been retired. The last eight words are substituted for 37:372(a) (7th through 17th words of last sentence). 37:372(a) (last sentence, less 1st 17 words) is omitted as surplusage.</p>

L. 87&ndash;381 substituted permission to make a corrected election within 90 days after notice that the election is void for any reason, except fraud or willful intent of the member making election, with such election effective as of the date of the election it replaces, for provisions which denied the ability to revoke any election by a person retired or granted retired or retainer pay before Nov. 1, 1953, and who elected within 180 days after that date to receive reduced pay to provide for an annuity.</p>
<p class="note-body">1958&mdash;Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 85&ndash;861 struck out &ldquo;in action&rdquo; after &ldquo;he is missing&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The reduction in the retired or retainer pay of any person who elects an annuity under this subchapter shall be computed by the armed force concerned as of the date when the person becomes eligible for that pay but without regard to any increase in that pay to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. It shall be computed under an actuarial equivalent method based on (1) appropriate actuarial tables selected by the Board of Actuaries, and (2) an interest rate of 3 percent a year, or such other rate as the Secretary of the Treasury, after considering the average yield on outstanding marketable long-term obligations of the United States during the preceding six months, may specify by August 1 of any year for the following year. The method and tables shall be those in effect on the date as of which the computation is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Under regulations prescribed under section 1444(a) of this title, the Secretary concerned may, upon application by the retired member, allow the member&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to reduce the amount of the annuity specified by him under section 1434(a) and 1434(b) of this title but to not less than the prescribed minimum; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to withdraw from participation in an annuity program under this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to elect the annuity provided under clause (1) of section 1434(a) of this title in place of the annuity provided under clause (3) of such section, if on the first day for which retired or retainer pay is granted the member had in effect a valid election under clause (3) of such section, and he does not have a child beneficiary who would be eligible for the annuity provided under clause (3) of such section. For this purpose, a child (other than a child who is incapable of supporting himself because of a mental defect or physical incapacity existing before his eighteenth birthday) who is at least eighteen, but under twenty-three years of age shall not be considered an eligible beneficiary; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to elect that a child (other than a child who is incapable of supporting himself because of a mental defect or physical incapacity existing before his eighteenth birthday) who is at least eighteen, but under twenty-three years of age shall not be considered eligible for the annuity provided under clause (2) of section 1434(a) of this title, or for an annuity provided under section 1434(b) of this title, if on the first day for which retired or retainer pay is granted the member had in effect a valid election under clause (2) of section 1434(a) of this title, or under section 1434(b) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">A retired member may not reduce an annuity under clause (1) of this subsection, or withdraw under clause (2) of this subsection, earlier than the first day of the seventh calendar month beginning after he applies for reduction or withdrawal. A change of election under clause (3) of this subsection shall be effective on the first day of the month following the month in which application is made. An election under clause (4) of this subsection shall be effective on the first day of the month following the month in which application is made and, if on the effective date there is no surviving child who would be eligible for an annuity provided under clause (2) of section 1434(a), or under section 1434(b), of this title if the elector died, no deduction shall be made for such an annuity to, or on behalf of, a child from the elector's retired or retainer pay for that month or any subsequent month. No amounts by which a member's retired or retainer pay is reduced prior to the effective date of a reduction of annuity, withdrawal, change of election, or election under this subsection may be refunded to, or credited on behalf of, the member by virtue of an application made by him under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), each annuity payable under this subchapter accrues as of the first day of the month in which the person upon whose pay the annuity is based dies.

The monthly amount of an annuity payable under this subchapter, if not a multiple of $1, shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of $1.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Each annuity payable to or on behalf of an eligible child (other than a child who is incapable of supporting himself because of a mental defect or physical incapacity existing before his eighteenth birthday) as defined in section 1435(2)(B) of this title who is at least eighteen years of age and pursuing a full-time course of study or training at a recognized educational institution, accrues&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as of the first day of the month in which the eighteenth birthday of an eligible child occurs, if the member upon whose pay the annuity is based died in a preceding month.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) as of the first day of the month in which a child first becomes or again becomes eligible, if that eligible child's eighteenth birthday and the death of the member upon whose pay the annuity is based both occurred in a preceding month or months.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">However, no such annuity is payable or accrues for any month before November 1, 1968.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Upon application of the beneficiary of a member entitled to retired or retainer pay whose retired or retainer pay has been suspended because the member has been determined to be missing, the Secretary concerned may determine for purposes of this subchapter that the member is presumed dead. Any such determination shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed under section 1444(a) of this title. The Secretary concerned may not make a determination for purposes of this subchapter that a member is presumed dead unless he finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the member has been missing for at least 30 days; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that the circumstances under which the member is missing would lead a reasonably prudent person to conclude that the member is dead.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon a determination under paragraph (1) with respect to a member, an annuity otherwise payable under this subchapter shall be paid as if the member died on the date as of which the retired or retainer pay of the member was suspended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If, after a determination under paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned determines that the member is alive, any annuity being paid under this subchapter by reason of this subsection shall be promptly terminated and the total amount of any annuity payments made by reason of this subsection shall constitute a debt to the United States which may be collected or offset&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the member dies before the full recovery of the amount of annuity payments described in subparagraph (A) has been made by the United States, the remaining amount of such annuity payments may be collected from the member's beneficiary under this subchapter if that beneficiary was the recipient of the annuity payments made by reason of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) That reductions in retired pay under this section are made in amounts sufficient to provide that the Supplemental Survivor Benefit Plan operates on an actuarially neutral basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) That such reductions are stated, with respect to the base amount (under the Survivor Benefit Plan) of any person, as a constant percentage of that base amount and, in the case of a person providing a supplemental spouse annuity computed under section 1457(b) of this title, a constant percentage of such person's base amount for each 5 percent increment specified in accordance with that section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) That the amounts of such reductions in retired pay of persons participating in the Supplemental Survivor Benefit Plan (stated as a percentage of base amount)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are based on the age of the participant at the time participation in that Plan is first effective under this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) are not determined by any other demographic differentiation among participants in the Plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
