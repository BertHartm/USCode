<h4 class="note-head">Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism</h4>
<p class="note-body">Military Order of President of the United States, dated Nov. 13, 2001, 66 F.R. 57833, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President and as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Authorization for Use of Military Force Joint Resolution (Public Law 107&ndash;40, 115 Stat. 224) [50 U.S.C. 1541 note] and sections 821 and 836 of title 10, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:402 --><p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Findings.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) International terrorists, including members of al Qaida, have carried out attacks on United States diplomatic and military personnel and facilities abroad and on citizens and property within the United States on a scale that has created a state of armed conflict that requires the use of the United States Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In light of grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism, including the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, on the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense in the national capital region, on the World Trade Center in New York, and on civilian aircraft such as in Pennsylvania, I proclaimed a national emergency on September 14, 2001 (Proc. 7463, Declaration of National Emergency by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks [50 U.S.C. 1621 note]).</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Individuals acting alone and in concert involved in international terrorism possess both the capability and the intention to undertake further terrorist attacks against the United States that, if not detected and prevented, will cause mass deaths, mass injuries, and massive destruction of property, and may place at risk the continuity of the operations of the United States Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The ability of the United States to protect the United States and its citizens, and to help its allies and other cooperating nations protect their nations and their citizens, from such further terrorist attacks depends in significant part upon using the United States Armed Forces to identify terrorists and those who support them, to disrupt their activities, and to eliminate their ability to conduct or support such attacks.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) To protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks, it is necessary for individuals subject to this order pursuant to section 2 hereof to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Given the danger to the safety of the United States and the nature of international terrorism, and to the extent provided by and under this order, I find consistent with section 836 of title 10, United States Code, that it is not practicable to apply in military commissions under this order the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) Having fully considered the magnitude of the potential deaths, injuries, and property destruction that would result from potential acts of terrorism against the United States, and the probability that such acts will occur, I have determined that an extraordinary emergency exists for national defense purposes, that this emergency constitutes an urgent and compelling government interest, and that issuance of this order is necessary to meet the emergency.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Definition and Policy.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The term &ldquo;individual subject to this order&rdquo; shall mean any individual who is not a United States citizen with respect to whom I determine from time to time in writing that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) there is reason to believe that such individual, at the relevant times,</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(i) is or was a member of the organization known as al Qaida;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(ii) has engaged in, aided or abetted, or conspired to commit, acts of international terrorism, or acts in preparation therefor, that have caused, threaten to cause, or have as their aim to cause, injury to or adverse effects on the United States, its citizens, national security, foreign policy, or economy; or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(iii) has knowingly harbored one or more individuals described in subparagraphs (i) or (ii) of subsection 2(a)(1) of this order; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) it is in the interest of the United States that such individual be subject to this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) It is the policy of the United States that the Secretary of Defense shall take all necessary measures to ensure that any individual subject to this order is detained in accordance with section 3, and, if the individual is to be tried, that such individual is tried only in accordance with section 4.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) It is further the policy of the United States that any individual subject to this order who is not already under the control of the Secretary of Defense but who is under the control of any other officer or agent of the United States or any State shall, upon delivery of a copy of such written determination to such officer or agent, forthwith be placed under the control of the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Detention Authority of the Secretary of Defense</em>. Any individual subject to this order shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) detained at an appropriate location designated by the Secretary of Defense outside or within the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) treated humanely, without any adverse distinction based on race, color, religion, gender, birth, wealth, or any similar criteria;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) afforded adequate food, drinking water, shelter, clothing, and medical treatment;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) allowed the free exercise of religion consistent with the requirements of such detention; and</p>

<p class="note-body">Departments, agencies, entities, and officers of the United States shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, provide to the Secretary of Defense such assistance as he may request to implement this order.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13492. Review and Disposition of Individuals Detained At the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and Closure of Detention Facilities</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13492, Jan. 22, 2009, 74 F.R. 4897, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, in order to effect the appropriate disposition of individuals currently detained by the Department of Defense at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (Guantanamo) and promptly to close detention facilities at Guantanamo, consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and the interests of justice, I hereby order as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Definitions</em>. As used in this order:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) &ldquo;Common Article 3&rdquo; means Article 3 of each of the Geneva Conventions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Geneva Conventions&rdquo; means:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3114);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3217);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3316); and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iv) the Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3516).</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) &ldquo;Individuals currently detained at Guantanamo&rdquo; and &ldquo;individuals covered by this order&rdquo; mean individuals currently detained by the Department of Defense in facilities at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base whom the Department of Defense has ever determined to be, or treated as, enemy combatants.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Findings</em>.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Over the past 7 years, approximately 800 individuals whom the Department of Defense has ever determined to be, or treated as, enemy combatants have been detained at Guantanamo. The Federal Government has moved more than 500 such detainees from Guantanamo, either by returning them to their home country or by releasing or transferring them to a third country. The Department of Defense has determined that a number of the individuals currently detained at Guantanamo are eligible for such transfer or release.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Some individuals currently detained at Guantanamo have been there for more than 6 years, and most have been detained for at least 4 years. In view of the significant concerns raised by these detentions, both within the United States and internationally, prompt and appropriate disposition of the individuals currently detained at Guantanamo and closure of the facilities in which they are detained would further the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and the interests of justice. Merely closing the facilities without promptly determining the appropriate disposition of the individuals detained would not adequately serve those interests. To the extent practicable, the prompt and appropriate disposition of the individuals detained at Guantanamo should precede the closure of the detention facilities at Guantanamo.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The individuals currently detained at Guantanamo have the constitutional privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. Most of those individuals have filed petitions for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal court challenging the lawfulness of their detention.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) It is in the interests of the United States that the executive branch undertake a prompt and thorough review of the factual and legal bases for the continued detention of all individuals currently held at Guantanamo, and of whether their continued detention is in the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and in the interests of justice. The unusual circumstances associated with detentions at Guantanamo require a comprehensive interagency review.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) New diplomatic efforts may result in an appropriate disposition of a substantial number of individuals currently detained at Guantanamo.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Some individuals currently detained at Guantanamo may have committed offenses for which they should be prosecuted. It is in the interests of the United States to review whether and how any such individuals can and should be prosecuted.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) It is in the interests of the United States that the executive branch conduct a prompt and thorough review of the circumstances of the individuals currently detained at Guantanamo who have been charged with offenses before military commissions pursuant to the Military Commissions Act of 2006, Public Law 109&ndash;366, as well as of the military commission process more generally.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Closure of Detention Facilities at Guantanamo</em>. The detention facilities at Guantanamo for individuals covered by this order shall be closed as soon as practicable, and no later than 1 year from the date of this order. If any individuals covered by this order remain in detention at Guantanamo at the time of closure of those detention facilities, they shall be returned to their home country, released, transferred to a third country, or transferred to another United States detention facility in a manner consistent with law and the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Immediate Review of All Guantanamo Detentions.</em></p>

<p class="note-body-1em">(3) <em>Determination of Prosecution</em>.

<p class="note-body-1em">(4) <em>Determination of Other Disposition</em>. With respect to any individuals currently detained at Guantanamo whose disposition is not achieved under paragraphs (2) or (3) of this subsection, the Review shall select lawful means, consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and the interests of justice, for the disposition of such individuals.

<p class="note-body-1em">(5) <em>Consideration of Issues Relating to Transfer to the United States</em>. The Review shall identify and consider legal, logistical, and security issues relating to the potential transfer of individuals currently detained at Guantanamo to facilities within the United States, and the Review participants shall work with the Congress on any legislation that may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Diplomatic Efforts</em>. The Secretary of State shall expeditiously pursue and direct such negotiations and diplomatic efforts with foreign governments as are necessary and appropriate to implement this order.</p>

The Secretary of Defense shall immediately undertake a review of the conditions of detention at Guantanamo to ensure full compliance with this directive. Such review shall be completed within 30 days and any necessary corrections shall be implemented immediately thereafter.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Military Commissions</em>. The Secretary of Defense shall immediately take steps sufficient to ensure that during the pendency of the Review described in section 4 of this order, no charges are sworn, or referred to a military commission under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and the Rules for Military Commissions, and that all proceedings of such military commissions to which charges have been referred but in which no judgment has been rendered, and all proceedings pending in the United States Court of Military Commission Review, are halted.</p>

<p class="note-body">(a) Nothing in this order shall prejudice the authority of the Secretary of Defense to determine the disposition of any detainees not covered by this order.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13567. Periodic Review of Individuals Detained at Guanta�AE1namo Bay Naval Station Pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13567, Mar. 7, 2011, 76 F.R. 13277, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Authorization for Use of Military Force of September 2001 (AUMF), Public Law 107&ndash;40, and in order to ensure that military detention of individuals now held at the U.S. Naval Station, Guanta�AE1namo Bay, Cuba (Guanta�AE1namo), who were subject to the interagency review under section 4 of Executive Order 13492 of January 22, 2009, continues to be carefully evaluated and justified, consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and the interests of justice, I hereby order as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Scope and Purpose</em>. (a) The periodic review described in section 3 of this order applies only to those detainees held at Guanta�AE1namo on the date of this order, whom the interagency review established by Executive Order 13492 has (i) designated for continued law of war detention; or (ii) referred for prosecution, except for those detainees against whom charges are pending or a judgment of conviction has been entered.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order is intended solely to establish, as a discretionary matter, a process to review on a periodic basis the executive branch's continued, discretionary exercise of existing detention authority in individual cases. It does not create any additional or separate source of detention authority, and it does not affect the scope of detention authority under existing law. Detainees at Guanta�AE1namo have the constitutional privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and nothing in this order is intended to affect the jurisdiction of Federal courts to determine the legality of their detention.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) In the event detainees covered by this order are transferred from Guanta�AE1namo to another U.S. detention facility where they remain in law of war detention, this order shall continue to apply to them.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Standard for Continued Detention</em>. Continued law of war detention is warranted for a detainee subject to the periodic review in section 3 of this order if it is necessary to protect against a significant threat to the security of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Periodic Review</em>. The Secretary of Defense shall coordinate a process of periodic review of continued law of war detention for each detainee described in section 1(a) of this order. In consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense shall issue implementing guidelines governing the process, consistent with the following requirements:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <em>Initial Review</em>. For each detainee, an initial review shall commence as soon as possible but no later than 1 year from the date of this order. The initial review will consist of a hearing before a Periodic Review Board (PRB). The review and hearing shall follow a process that includes the following requirements:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Each detainee shall be provided, in writing and in a language the detainee understands, with advance notice of the PRB review and an unclassified summary of the factors and information the PRB will consider in evaluating whether the detainee meets the standard set forth in section 2 of this order. The written summary shall be sufficiently comprehensive to provide adequate notice to the detainee of the reasons for continued detention.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The detainee shall be assisted in proceedings before the PRB by a Government-provided personal representative (representative) who possesses the security clearances necessary for access to the information described in subsection (a)(4) of this section. The representative shall advocate on behalf of the detainee before the PRB and shall be responsible for challenging the Government's information and introducing information on behalf of the detainee. In addition to the representative, the detainee may be assisted in proceedings before the PRB by private counsel, at no expense to the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) The detainee shall be permitted to (i) present to the PRB a written or oral statement; (ii) introduce relevant information, including written declarations; (iii) answer any questions posed by the PRB; and (iv) call witnesses who are reasonably available and willing to <!-- PDFPage:405 -->provide information that is relevant and material to the standard set forth in section 2 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with other relevant Government agencies, shall compile and provide to the PRB all information in the detainee disposition recommendations produced by the Task Force established under Executive Order 13492 that is relevant to the determination whether the standard in section 2 of this order has been met and on which the Government seeks to rely for that determination. In addition, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with other relevant Government agencies, shall compile any additional information relevant to that determination, and on which the Government seeks to rely for that determination, that has become available since the conclusion of the Executive Order 13492 review. All mitigating information relevant to that determination must be provided to the PRB.</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) The information provided in subsection (a)(4) of this section shall be provided to the detainee's representative. In exceptional circumstances where it is necessary to protect national security, including intelligence sources and methods, the PRB may determine that the representative must receive a sufficient substitute or summary, rather than the underlying information. If the detainee is represented by private counsel, the information provided in subsection (a)(4) of this section shall be provided to such counsel unless the Government determines that the need to protect national security, including intelligence sources and methods, or law enforcement or privilege concerns, requires the Government to provide counsel with a sufficient substitute or summary of the information. A sufficient substitute or summary must provide a meaningful opportunity to assist the detainee during the review process.</p>
<p class="note-body">(6) The PRB shall conduct a hearing to consider the information described in subsection (a)(4) of this section, and other relevant information provided by the detainee or the detainee's representative or counsel, to determine whether the standard in section 2 of this order is met. The PRB shall consider the reliability of any information provided to it in making its determination.</p>
<p class="note-body">(7) The PRB shall make a prompt determination, by consensus and in writing, as to whether the detainee's continued detention is warranted under the standard in section 2 of this order. If the PRB determines that the standard is not met, the PRB shall also recommend any conditions that relate to the detainee's transfer. The PRB shall provide a written summary of any final determination in unclassified form to the detainee, in a language the detainee understands, within 30 days of the determination when practicable.</p>
<p class="note-body">(8) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a secretariat to administer the PRB review and hearing process. The Director of National Intelligence shall assist in preparing the unclassified notice and the substitutes or summaries described above. Other executive departments and agencies shall assist in the process of providing the PRB with information required for the review processes detailed in this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Subsequent Full Review</em>. The continued detention of each detainee shall be subject to subsequent full reviews and hearings by the PRB on a triennial basis. Each subsequent review shall employ the procedures set forth in section 3(a) of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) <em>File Reviews</em>. The continued detention of each detainee shall also be subject to a file review every 6 months in the intervening years between full reviews. This file review will be conducted by the PRB and shall consist of a review of any relevant new information related to the detainee compiled by the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with other relevant agencies, since the last review and, as appropriate, information considered during any prior PRB review. The detainee shall be permitted to make a written submission in connection with each file review. If, during the file review, a significant question is raised as to whether the detainee's continued detention is warranted under the standard in section 2 of this order, the PRB will promptly convene a full review pursuant to the standards in section 3(a) of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) <em>Review of PRB Determinations</em>. The Review Committee (Committee), as defined in section 9(d) of this order, shall conduct a review if (i) a member of the Committee seeks review of a PRB determination within 30 days of that determination; or (ii) consensus within the PRB cannot be reached.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Effect of Determination to Transfer</em>. (a) If a final determination is made that a detainee does not meet the standard in section 2 of this order, the Secretaries of State and Defense shall be responsible for ensuring that vigorous efforts are undertaken to identify a suitable transfer location for any such detainee, outside of the United States, consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and the commitment set forth in section 2242(a) of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (Public Law 105&ndash;277).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall be responsible for obtaining appropriate security and humane treatment assurances regarding any detainee to be transferred to another country, and for determining, after consultation with members of the Committee, that it is appropriate to proceed with the transfer.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Secretary of State shall evaluate humane treatment assurances in all cases, consistent with the recommendations of the Special Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer Policies established by Executive Order 13491 of January 22, 2009.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Annual Committee Review</em>. (a) The Committee shall conduct an annual review of sufficiency and efficacy of transfer efforts, including:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) the status of transfer efforts for any detainee who has been subject to the periodic review under section 3 of this order, whose continued detention has been determined not to be warranted, and who has not been transferred more than 6 months after the date of such determination;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) the status of transfer efforts for any detainee whose petition for a writ of habeas corpus has been granted by a U.S. Federal court with no pending appeal and who has not been transferred;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) the status of transfer efforts for any detainee who has been designated for transfer or conditional detention by the Executive Order 13492 review and who has not been transferred; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) the security and other conditions in the countries to which detainees might be transferred, including a review of any suspension of transfers to a particular country, in order to determine whether further steps to facilitate transfers are appropriate or to provide a recommendation to the President regarding whether continuation of any such suspension is warranted.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) After completion of the initial reviews under section 3(a) of this order, and at least once every 4 years thereafter, the Committee shall review whether a continued law of war detention policy remains consistent with the interests of the United States, including national security interests.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Continuing Obligation of the Departments of Justice and Defense to Assess Feasibility of Prosecution</em>. As to each detainee whom the interagency review established by Executive Order 13492 has designated for continued law of war detention, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense shall continue to assess whether prosecution of the detainee is feasible and in the national security interests of the United States, and shall refer detainees for prosecution, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Obligation of Other Departments and Agencies to Assist the Secretary of Defense</em>. All departments, agencies, entities, and officers of the United States, to the maximum extent permitted by law, shall provide the Secretary of Defense such assistance as may be requested to implement this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. <em>Legality of Detention</em>. The process established under this order does not address the legality of any detainee's law of war detention. If, at any time during the <!-- PDFPage:406 -->periodic review process established in this order, material information calls into question the legality of detention, the matter will be referred immediately to the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General for appropriate action.</p>

<p class="note-body">(c) &ldquo;Conditional Detention&rdquo; means: the status of those detainees designated by the Executive Order 13492 review as eligible for transfer if one of the following conditions is satisfied: (1) the security situation improves in Yemen; (2) an appropriate rehabilitation program becomes available; or (3) an appropriate third-country resettlement option becomes available.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) &ldquo;Review Committee&rdquo; means: a committee composed of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) If any commissioned officer, dismissed by order of the President, makes a written application for trial by court-martial, setting forth, under oath, that he has been wrongfully dismissed, the President, as soon as practicable, shall convene a general court-martial to try that officer on the charges on which he was dismissed. A court-martial so convened has jurisdiction to try the dismissed officer on those charges, and he shall be considered to have waived the right to plead any statute of limitations applicable to any offense with which he is charged. The court-martial may, as part of its sentence, adjudge the affirmance of the dismissal, but if the court-martial acquits the accused or if the sentence adjudged, as finally approved or affirmed, does not include dismissal or death, the Secretary concerned shall substitute for the dismissal ordered by the President a form of discharge authorized for administrative issue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If the President fails to convene a general court-martial within six months from the presentation of an application for trial under this article, the Secretary concerned shall substitute for the dismissal ordered by the President a form of discharge authorized for administrative issue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If a discharge is substituted for a dismissal under this article, the President alone may reappoint the officer to such commissioned grade and with such rank as, in the opinion of the President, that former officer would have attained had he not been dismissed. The reappointment of such a former officer shall be without regard to the existence of a vacancy and shall affect the promotion status of other officers only insofar as the President may direct. All time between the dismissal and the reappointment shall be considered as actual service for all purposes, including the right to pay and allowances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If an officer is discharged from any armed force by administrative action or is dropped from the rolls by order of the President, he has no right to trial under this article.</p>
