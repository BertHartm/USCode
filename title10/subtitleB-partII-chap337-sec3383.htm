The convening officer shall refer the list to the selection board for consideration. Without regard to section 3363(a) and (b) of this title, he may also place on such a list for promotion to the next higher reserve grade the name of any reserve first lieutenant or second lieutenant who has served creditably for at least a year in a position that is in a unit organized to serve as a unit and is prescribed to be filled by a captain, and who has not previously been promoted under this section.</p>
