<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), the members of the Board shall serve for a term of fifteen years, except that a member of the Board appointed to fill a vacancy occurring before the end of the term for which his predecessor was appointed shall only serve until the end of such term.

<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall keep, or cause to be kept, such records as necessary for determining the actuarial status of the Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) The Secretary of Defense shall carry out periodic actuarial valuations of the educational programs described in subsection (b)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Based on the most recent such valuation, the Secretary of Defense shall estimate the normal cost for the next fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If at the time of any such valuation there has been a change in benefits under an education program described in subsection (b)(1) that has been made since the last such valuation and that increases or decreases the present value of benefits payable from the Fund, the Secretary of Defense shall determine an amortization methodology and schedule for the liquidation of the unfunded liability (or negative unfunded liability) thus created such that the present value of the sum of the amortization payments equals the increase or decrease in the present value of such benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If at the time of any such valuation the Secretary of Defense determines that, based upon changes in actuarial assumptions since the last valuation, there has been an actuarial gain or loss to the Fund, the Secretary shall determine an amortization methodology and schedule for the liquidation of such gain or loss through an increase or decrease in the payments that would otherwise be made to the Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Based on the determinations under paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) the Secretary of Defense shall determine the amount needed to be appropriated to the Department of Defense for the next fiscal year for payments to be made to the Fund under subsection (g). The President shall include not less than the full amount so determined in the budget transmitted to Congress for the next fiscal year under section 1105 of title 31. The President may comment and make recommendations concerning any such amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) All determinations under this subsection shall be made using methods and assumptions approved by the Board of Actuaries (including assumptions of interest rates and inflation) and in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and practices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) The Secretary of Defense shall pay into the Fund each month the amount that, based upon the most recent actuarial valuation of the education programs described in subsection (b)(1), is equal to the actual total normal cost for the preceding month.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall pay into the Fund at the beginning of each fiscal year (or as soon thereafter as appropriations are available for such purpose) the sum of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The amount of the payment for that year, if any, for the amortization of any liability to the Fund resulting from a change in benefits, as determined by the Secretary of Defense under subsection (f)(3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The amount of the payment for that year, if any, for the amortization of any actuarial gain or loss to the Fund, as determined by the Secretary of Defense under subsection (f)(4).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Amounts paid into the Fund under this subsection shall be paid from appropriations available for the pay of members of the armed forces under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest such portion of the Fund as is not in the judgment of the Secretary required to meet current withdrawals. Such investments shall be in public debt securities with maturities suitable to the needs of the Fund, as determined by the Secretary, and bearing interest at rates determined by the Secretary, taking into consideration current market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities. The income on such investments shall be credited to and form a part of the Fund.</p>
