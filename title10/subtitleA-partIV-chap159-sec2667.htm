<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Whenever the Secretary of a military department considers it advantageous to the United States, he may lease to such lessee and upon such terms as he considers will promote the national defense or be in the public interest, real or personal property that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) under the control of that department;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) not for the time needed for public use; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A lease under subsection (a)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may not be for more than five years, unless the Secretary concerned determines that a lease for a longer period will promote the national defense or be in the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may give the lessee the first right to buy the property if the lease is revoked to allow the United States to sell the property under any other provision of law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall permit the Secretary to revoke the lease at any time, unless he determines that the omission of such a provision will promote the national defense or be in the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) shall provide for the payment (in cash or in kind) by the lessee of consideration in an amount that is not less than the fair market value of the lease interest, as determined by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) may provide, notwithstanding section 321 of the Act of June 30, 1932 (40 U.S.C. 303b), or any other provision of law, for the improvement, maintenance, protection, repair, or restoration, by the lessee, of the property leased, or of the entire unit or installation where a substantial part of it is leased, as the payment of part or all of the consideration for the lease.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) This section does not apply to oil, mineral, or phosphate lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1)(A) All money rentals received pursuant to leases entered into by the Secretary of a military department under this section shall be deposited in a special account in the Treasury established for such military department, except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) amounts paid for utilities and services furnished lessees by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) money rentals referred to in paragraph (4) or (5).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Sums deposited in a military department's special account pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be available to such military department, as provided in appropriation Acts, as follows:</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Payments for utilities and services furnished lessees pursuant to leases entered into under this section shall be credited to the appro<!-- PDFPage:1104 -->priation account or working capital fund from which the cost of furnishing the utilities and services was paid.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an accounting of the receipt and use of all money rentals that were deposited and expended under this subsection during the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which the request is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a detailed explanation of each lease entered into, and of each amendment made to existing leases, during such preceding fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Money rentals received by the United States directly from a lease under this section for agricultural or grazing purposes of lands under the control of the Secretary of a military department (other than lands acquired by the United States for flood control or navigation purposes or any related purpose, including the development of hydroelectric power) may be retained and spent by the Secretary concerned in such amounts as the Secretary considers necessary to cover the administrative expenses of leasing for such purposes and to cover the financing of multiple-land use management programs at any installation under the jurisdiction of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Money rentals received by the United States from a lease under subsection (f) shall be deposited into the account established under section 2906(a) of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101&ndash;510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(3) or the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (to the extent such Act is inconsistent with this subsection), pending the final disposition of real property and personal property located at a military installation to be closed or realigned under a base closure law, the Secretary of the military department concerned may lease the property to any individual or entity under this subsection if the Secretary determines that such a lease would facilitate State or local economic adjustment efforts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding subsection (b)(4), the Secretary concerned may accept consideration in an amount that is less than the fair market value of the lease interest if the Secretary concerned determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a public interest will be served as a result of the lease; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the fair market value of the lease is (i) unobtainable, or (ii) not compatible with such public benefit.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Before entering into any lease under this subsection, the Secretary shall consult with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in order to determine whether the environmental condition of the property proposed for leasing is such that the lease of the property is advisable. The Secretary and the Administrator shall enter into a memorandum of understanding setting forth procedures for carrying out the determinations under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary concerned may accept under subsection (b)(5) services of a lessee for an entire installation to be closed or realigned under a base closure law, or for any part of such installation, without regard to the requirement in subsection (b)(5) that a substantial part of the installation be leased.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Notwithstanding the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), the scope of any environmental impact analysis necessary to support an interim lease of property under this subsection shall be limited to the environmental consequences of activities authorized under the proposed lease and the cumulative impacts of other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions during the period of the proposed lease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Interim leases entered into under this subsection shall be deemed not to prejudice the final disposal decision with respect to the property, even if final disposal of the property is delayed until completion of the term of the interim lease. An interim lease under this subsection shall not be entered into without prior consultation with the redevelopment authority concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply to an interim lease under this subsection if authorized activities under the lease would&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) significantly affect the quality of the human environment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) irreversibly alter the environment in a way that would preclude any reasonable disposal alternative of the property concerned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) If a proposed lease under subsection (a) involves only personal property, the lease term exceeds one year, and the fair market value of the lease interest exceeds $100,000, as determined by the Secretary concerned, the Secretary shall use competitive procedures to select the lessee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 45 days before entering into a lease described in paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned shall submit to Congress written notice describing the terms of the proposed lease and the competitive procedures used to select the lessee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) In this section, the term &ldquo;base closure law&rdquo; means each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101&ndash;510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note).</p>
