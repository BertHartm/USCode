<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Those organizations with the primary mission of providing direct support surface and aviation maintenance for the reserve components of the Army and Air Force, to the extent that the military technicians (dual status) in such units would mobilize and deploy in a skill that is compatible with their civilian position skill.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For each fiscal year, the Secretary of Defense shall, for the high-priority units and organizations referred to in paragraph (1), seek to achieve a programmed manning level for military technicians (dual status) that is not less than 90 percent of the programmed manpower structure for those units and organizations for military technicians (dual status) for that fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Military technician (dual status) authorizations and personnel shall be exempt from any requirement (imposed by law or otherwise) for reductions in Department of Defense civilian personnel and shall only be reduced as part of military force structure reductions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Information Required To Be Submitted With Annual End Strength Authorization Request</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall include as part of the budget justification documents submitted to Congress with the budget of the Department of Defense for any fiscal year the following information with respect to the end strengths for military technicians (dual status) requested in that budget pursuant to section 115(d) of this title, shown separately for each of the Army and Air Force reserve components:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any justification submitted under subparagraph (A) shall clearly delineate the specific force structure reductions forming the basis for such requested technician reduction (and the numbers related to those reductions).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Unit Membership Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Unless specifically exempted by law, each individual who is hired as a military technician (dual status) after December 1, 1995, shall be required as a condition of that employment to maintain membership in&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as otherwise provided by law, the Secretary concerned may pay compensation described in paragraph (1) to an individual described in that paragraph who is no longer a member of the Selected Reserve for a period up to 12 months following the individual's loss of membership in the Selected Reserve if the Secretary determines that such loss of membership <!-- PDFPage:2277 -->was not due to the failure of that individual to meet military standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Deferral of Mandatory Separation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Air Force shall implement personnel policies so as to allow a military technician (dual status) who continues to meet the requirements of this section for dual status to continue to serve beyond a mandatory removal date for officers, and any applicable maximum years of service limitation, until the military technician (dual status) reaches age 60 and attains eligibility for an unreduced annuity (as defined in section 10218(c) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Retention of Military Technicians Who Lose Dual Status Due to Combat-Related Disability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Notwithstanding subsection (d) of this section or subsections (a)(3) and (b) of section 10218 of this title, if a military technician (dual status) loses such dual status as the result of a combat-related disability (as defined in section 1413a of this title), the person may be retained as a non-dual status technician so long as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the combat-related disability does not prevent the person from performing the non-dual status functions or position; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the person, while a non-dual status technician, is not disqualified from performing the non-dual status functions or position because of performance, medical, or other reasons.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person so retained shall be removed not later than 30 days after becoming eligible for an unreduced annuity and becoming 60 years of age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Persons retained under the authority of this subsection do not count against the limitations of section 10217(c) of this title.</p>
