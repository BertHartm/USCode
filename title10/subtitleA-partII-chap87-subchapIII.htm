The Secretary shall require that the major milestones as defined in the regulations be included in the Selected Acquisition Report required for such program under section 2432 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Waiver of Assignment Period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) With respect to a person assigned to a critical acquisition position, the Secretary concerned may waive the prohibition on reassignment of that person (in subsection (a)(1) or (b)(1)) and the service obligation in an agreement executed by that person (under subsection (a)(2) or (b)(2)), but only in exceptional circumstances in which a waiver is necessary for reasons permitted in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The authority to grant such waivers may be delegated by the service acquisition executive of a military department only to the Director of Acquisition Career Management for the military department.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) With respect to each waiver granted under this subsection, the service acquisition executive (or his delegate) shall set forth in a written document the rationale for the decision to grant the waiver. The document shall be submitted to the Director of Acquisition Education, Training, and Career Development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Rotation Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a policy encouraging the rotation of members of an Acquisition Corps serving in critical acquisition positions to new assignments after completion of five years of service in such positions, or, in the case of a program manager, after completion of a major program milestone, whichever is longer. Such rotation policy shall be designed to ensure opportunities for career broadening assignments and an infusion of new ideas into critical acquisition positions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a procedure under which the assignment of each person assigned to a critical acquisition position shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, by the acquisition career program board of the department concerned, for the purpose of determining whether the Government and such person would be better served by a reassignment to a different position. Such a review shall be carried out with respect to each such person not later than five years after that person is assigned to a critical position. Reviews under this subsection shall be carried out after October 1, 1995, but may be carried out before that date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Centralized Job Referral System</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations providing for the use of centralized lists to ensure that persons are selected for critical positions without regard to geographic location of applicants for such positions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Exchange Program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall establish, for purposes of broadening the experience of members of each Acquisition Corps, a test program in which members of a Corps serving in a military department or Defense Agency are assigned or detailed to an acquisition position in another department or agency. Under the test program, the Secretary of Defense shall ensure that, to the maximum extent practicable, at least 5 percent of the members of the Acquisition Corps shall serve in such exchange assignments each year. The test program shall operate for not less than a period of three years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall submit the portion of the test program applicable to civilian employees to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management for approval. If the Director does not disapprove that portion of the test program within 30 days after the date on which the Director receives it, that portion of the test program is deemed to be approved by the Director.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Responsibility for Assignments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of each military department, acting through the service acquisition executive for that department, is responsible for making assignments of civilian and military members of the Acquisition Corps of that military department to critical acquisition positions.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this subchapter:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;program manager&rdquo; means, with respect to a defense acquisition program, the member of an Acquisition Corps responsible for managing the program, regardless of the title given the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;deputy program manager&rdquo; means the person who has authority to act on behalf of the program manager in the absence of the program manager.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;significant nonmajor defense acquisition program&rdquo; means a Department of Defense acquisition program that is not a major defense acquisition program (as defined in section 2430 of this title) and that is estimated by the Secretary of Defense to require an eventual total expenditure for research, development, test, and evaluation of more than the dollar threshold set forth in section 2302(5)(A) of this title for such purposes for a major system or an eventual total expenditure for procurement of more than the dollar threshold set forth in section 2302(5)(A) of this title for such purpose for a major system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The term &ldquo;program executive officer&rdquo; has the meaning given such term in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The term &ldquo;senior contracting official&rdquo; means a director of contracting, or a principal deputy to a director of contracting, serving in the office of the Secretary of a military department, the headquarters of a military department, the head of a Defense Agency, a subordinate command headquarters, or in a major systems or logistics contracting activity in the Department of Defense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Limitation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any civilian or military member of the Corps who does not meet the education, training, and experience requirements for a critical acquisition position established under this subchapter may not carry out the duties or exercise the authorities of that position, except for a period not to exceed six months, unless a waiver of the requirements is granted under subsection (c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Waiver</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of each military department (acting through the service acquisition executive for that department) or the Secretary of Defense (acting through the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology) for Defense Agencies and other components of the Department of Defense may waive, on a case-by-case basis, the requirements established under this subchapter with respect to the assignment of an individual to a particular critical acquisition position. Such a waiver may be granted only if unusual circumstances justify the waiver or if the Secretary concerned (or official to whom the waiver authority is delegated) determines that the individual's qualifications obviate the need for meeting the education, training, and experience requirements established under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The authority to grant such waivers may be delegated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of the service acquisition executives of the military departments, only to the Director of Acquisition Career Management for the military department concerned; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, only to the Director of Acquisition Education, Training, and Career Development.</p>

If the Director does not disapprove the requirement within 30 days after the date on which the Director receives the requirement, the requirement is deemed to be approved by the Director.</p>
