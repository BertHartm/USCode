<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the phrase &ldquo;Except as otherwise provided by law&rdquo; is added to preserve provisions directing that the Chief of Naval Operations and other statutory offices and boards share in the business of the executive part of the Department of the Navy. The words &ldquo;The Bureau of Aeronautics shall be charged with matters pertaining to naval aeronautics&rdquo; in 5 U.S.C. 455 are omitted as implied in the name of the bureau and covered by the authority granted to the Secretary to distribute the business of the Department.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the words &ldquo;and shall have full force and effect as such&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c) the words &ldquo;Under the Secretary&rdquo; are inserted to make the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 413 and 5 U.S.C. 430, the latter of which is here codified, harmonious and to give meaning to each provision.</p>
