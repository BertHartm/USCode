<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;After June 30, 1960&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;Effective five years after July 1, 1955&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;who is not removed from an active status at an earlier date and&rdquo;, in 50:1354(a), are omitted as surplusage. Reference to officers whose names are on a recommended list for promotion to the grade of brigadier general, in 50:1354(c), is omitted as covered by the word &ldquo;colonel&rdquo;, since only colonels are on a recommended list for promotion to that grade and, under 50:1354(a) and (c), the rule for colonels is the same whether they are on a recommended list or not.</p>
