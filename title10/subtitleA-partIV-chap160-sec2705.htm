<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Expedited Notice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall take such actions as necessary to ensure that the regional offices of the Environmental Protection Agency and appropriate State and local authorities for the State in which a facility under the Secretary's jurisdiction is located receive prompt notice of each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The discovery of releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The extent of the threat to public health and the environment which may be associated with any such release or threatened release.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Proposals made by the Secretary to carry out response actions with respect to any such release or threatened release.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The initiation of any response action with respect to such release or threatened release and the commencement of each distinct phase of such activities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Comment by EPA and State and Local Authorities.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Release notices</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall ensure that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and appropriate State and local officials have an adequate opportunity to comment on notices under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Proposals for response actions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall require that an adequate opportunity for timely review and comment be afforded to the Administrator and to appropriate State and local officials after making a proposal referred to in subsection (a)(3) and before undertaking an activity or action referred to in subsection (a)(4). The preceding sentence does not apply if the action is an emergency removal taken because of imminent and substantial endangerment to human health or the environment and consultation would be impractical.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Technical Review Committee</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever possible and practical, the Secretary shall establish a technical review committee to review and comment on Department of Defense actions and proposed actions with respect to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at installations. Members of any such committee shall include at least one representative of the Secretary, the Administrator, and appropriate State and local authorities and shall include a public representative of the community involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Restoration Advisory Board</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In lieu of establishing a technical review committee under subsection (c), the Secretary may permit the establishment of a restoration advisory board in connection with any installation (or group of nearby installations) where the Secretary is planning or implementing environmental restoration activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations regarding the establishment, characteristics, composition, and funding of restoration advisory boards pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The issuance of regulations under subparagraph (A) shall not be a precondition to the establishment of restoration advisory boards under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may authorize the commander of an installation (or, if there is no such commander, an appropriate official of the Department of Defense designated by the Secretary) to pay routine administrative expenses of a restoration advisory board established for that installation. Such payments shall be made from funds available under subsection (g).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Technical Assistance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may, upon the request of the technical review committee or restoration advisory board for an installation, authorize the commander of the installation (or, if there is no such commander, an appropriate official of the Department of Defense designated by the Secretary) to obtain for the committee or advisory board, as the case may be, from private sector sources technical assistance for interpreting scientific and engineering issues with regard to the nature of environmental hazards at the installation and the restoration activities conducted, or proposed to be conducted, at the installation. The commander of an installation (or, if there is no such commander, an appropriate official of the Department of Defense designated by the Secretary) shall use funds made available under subsection (g) for obtaining assistance under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The commander of an installation (or, if there is no such commander, an appropriate official of the Department of Defense designated by the Secretary) may obtain technical assistance under paragraph (1) for a technical review committee or restoration advisory board only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the technical review committee or restoration advisory board demonstrates that the Federal, State, and local agencies responsible <!-- PDFPage:1446 -->for overseeing environmental restoration at the installation, and available Department of Defense personnel, do not have the technical expertise necessary for achieving the objective for which the technical assistance is to be obtained; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the technical assistance&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is likely to contribute to the efficiency, effectiveness, or timeliness of environmental restoration activities at the installation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) is likely to contribute to community acceptance of environmental restoration activities at the installation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Involvement in Defense Environmental Restoration Program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a technical review committee or restoration advisory board is established with respect to an installation (or group of installations), the Secretary shall consult with and seek the advice of the committee or board on the following issues:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Identifying environmental restoration activities and projects at the installation or installations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Monitoring progress on these activities and projects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Collecting information regarding restoration priorities for the installation or installations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Addressing land use, level of restoration, acceptable risk, and waste management and technology development issues related to environmental restoration at the installation or installations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Developing environmental restoration strategies for the installation or installations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Funding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall, to the extent provided in appropriations Acts, make funds available for administrative expenses and technical assistance under this section using funds in the following accounts:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In the case of a military installation not approved for closure pursuant to a base closure law, the environmental restoration account concerned under section 2703(a) of this title.</p>
