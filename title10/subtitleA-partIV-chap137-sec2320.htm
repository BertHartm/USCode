<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to define the legitimate interest of the United States and of a contractor or subcontractor in technical data pertaining to an item or process. Such regulations shall be included in regulations of the Department of Defense prescribed as part of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Such regulations may not impair any right of the United States or of any contractor or subcontractor with respect to pat<!-- PDFPage:870 -->ents or copyrights or any other right in technical data otherwise established by law. Such regulations also may not impair the right of a contractor or subcontractor to receive from a third party a fee or royalty for the use of technical data pertaining to an item or process developed exclusively at private expense by the contractor or subcontractor, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such regulations shall include the following provisions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the case of an item or process that is developed by a contractor or subcontractor exclusively with Federal funds (other than an item or process developed under a contract or subcontract to which regulations under section 9(j)(2) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638(j)(2)) apply), the United States shall have the unlimited right to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) use technical data pertaining to the item or process; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) release or disclose the technical data to persons outside the government or permit the use of the technical data by such persons.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Except as provided in subparagraphs (C) and (D), in the case of an item or process that is developed by a contractor or subcontractor exclusively at private expense, the contractor or subcontractor may restrict the right of the United States to release or disclose technical data pertaining to the item or process to persons outside the government or permit the use of the technical data by such persons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Subparagraph (B) does not apply to technical data that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) constitutes a correction or change to data furnished by the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) relates to form, fit, or function;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) is necessary for operation, maintenance, installation, or training (other than detailed manufacturing or process data); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) is otherwise publicly available or has been released or disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor without restriction on further release or disclosure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Notwithstanding subparagraph (B), the United States may release or disclose technical data to persons outside the Government, or permit the use of technical data by such persons, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such release, disclosure, or use&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) is necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) is a release or disclosure of technical data (other than detailed manufacturing or process data) to, or use of such data by, a foreign government that is in the interest of the United States and is required for evaluational or informational purposes;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such release, disclosure, or use is made subject to a prohibition that the person to whom the data is released or disclosed may not further release, disclose, or use such data; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is notified of such release, disclosure, or use.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) In the case of an item or process that is developed in part with Federal funds and in part at private expense, the respective rights of the United States and of the contractor or subcontractor in technical data pertaining to such item or process shall be established as early in the acquisition process as practicable (preferably during contract negotiations) and shall be based upon negotiations between the United States and the contractor, except in any case in which the Secretary of Defense determines, on the basis of criteria established in the regulations, that negotiations would not be practicable. The establishment of such rights shall be based upon consideration of all of the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The statement of congressional policy and objectives in section 200 of title 35, the statement of purposes in section 2(b) of the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 (15 U.S.C. 638 note), and the declaration of policy in section 2 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The interest of the United States in increasing competition and lowering costs by developing and locating alternative sources of supply and manufacture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The interest of the United States in encouraging contractors to develop at private expense items for use by the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) Such other factors as the Secretary of Defense may prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) A contractor or subcontractor (or a prospective contractor or subcontractor) may not be required, as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for the award of a contract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to sell or otherwise relinquish to the United States any rights in technical data except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) rights in technical data described in subparagraph (C); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) under the conditions described in subparagraph (D); or</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) The Secretary of Defense may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) negotiate and enter into a contract with a contractor or subcontractor for the acquisition of rights in technical data not otherwise provided under subparagraph (C) or (D), if necessary to develop alternative sources of supply and manufacture;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) agree to restrict rights in technical data otherwise accorded to the United States under this section if the United States receives a royalty-free license to use, release, or disclose the data for purposes of the United States (including purposes of competitive procurement); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) permit a contractor or subcontractor to license directly to a third party the use of technical data which the contractor is otherwise allowed to restrict, if necessary to develop alternative sources of supply and manufacture.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Defense shall define the terms &ldquo;developed&rdquo;, &ldquo;exclusively with Federal <!-- PDFPage:871 -->funds&rdquo;, and &ldquo;exclusively at private expense&rdquo; in regulations prescribed under paragraph (1). In defining such terms, the Secretary shall specify the manner in which indirect costs shall be treated and shall specify that amounts spent for independent research and development and bid and proposal costs shall not be considered to be Federal funds for the purposes of definitions under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Regulations prescribed under subsection (a) shall require that, whenever practicable, a contract for supplies or services entered into by an agency named in section 2303 of this title contain appropriate provisions relating to technical data, including provisions&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) defining the respective rights of the United States and the contractor or subcontractor (at any tier) regarding any technical data to be delivered under the contract and providing that, in the case of a contract for a commercial item, the item shall be presumed to be developed at private expense unless shown otherwise in accordance with section 2321(f);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) specifying the technical data, if any, to be delivered under the contract and delivery schedules for such delivery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) establishing or referencing procedures for determining the acceptability of technical data to be delivered under the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) establishing separate contract line items for the technical data, if any, to be delivered under the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to the maximum practicable extent, identifying, in advance of delivery, technical data which is to be delivered with restrictions on the right of the United States to use such data;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) requiring the contractor to revise any technical data delivered under the contract to reflect engineering design changes made during the performance of the contract and affecting the form, fit, and function of the items specified in the contract and to deliver such revised technical data to an agency within a time specified in the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) requiring the contractor to furnish written assurance at the time the technical data is delivered or is made available that the technical data is complete and accurate and satisfies the requirements of the contract concerning technical data;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) establishing remedies to be available to the United States when technical data required to be delivered or made available under the contract is found to be incomplete or inadequate or to not satisfy the requirements of the contract concerning technical data; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) authorizing the head of the agency to withhold payments under the contract (or exercise such other remedies as the head of the agency considers appropriate) during any period if the contractor does not meet the requirements of the contract pertaining to the delivery of technical data.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Nothing in this section or in section 2305(d) of this title prohibits the Secretary of Defense from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prescribing standards for determining whether a contract entered into by the Department of Defense shall provide for a time to be specified in the contract after which the United States shall have the right to use (or have used) for any purpose of the United States all technical data required to be delivered to the United States under the contract or providing for such a period of time (not to exceed 7 years) as a negotiation objective; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) prescribing reasonable and flexible guidelines, including negotiation objectives, for the conduct of negotiations regarding the respective rights in technical data of the United States and the contractor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary of Defense shall by regulation establish programs which provide domestic business concerns an opportunity to purchase or borrow replenishment parts from the United States for the purpose of design replication or modification, to be used by such concerns in the submission of subsequent offers to sell the same or like parts to the United States. Nothing in this subsection limits the authority of the head of an agency to impose restrictions on such a program related to national security considerations, inventory needs of the United States, the improbability of future purchases of the same or like parts, or any additional restriction otherwise required by law.</p>
