<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to define the legitimate interest of the United States and of a contractor or subcontractor in technical data pertaining to an item or process. Such regulations shall be included in regulations of the Department of Defense prescribed as part of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Such regulations may not impair any right of the United States or of any contractor or subcontractor with respect to patents or copyrights or any other right in technical data otherwise established by law. Such regulations also may not impair the right of a contractor or subcontractor to receive from a third party a fee or royalty for the use of technical data pertaining to an item or process developed exclusively at private expense by the contractor or subcontractor, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such regulations shall include the following provisions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the case of an item or process that is developed by a contractor or subcontractor exclusively with Federal funds (other than an item or process developed under a contract or subcontract to which regulations under section 9(j)(2) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638(j)(2)) apply), the United States shall have the unlimited right to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) use technical data pertaining to the item or process; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) release or disclose the technical data to persons outside the government or permit the use of the technical data by such persons.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Except as provided in subparagraphs (C) and (D), in the case of an item or process that is developed by a contractor or subcontractor exclusively at private expense, the contractor or subcontractor may restrict the right of the United States to release or disclose technical data pertaining to the item or process to persons outside the government or permit the use of the technical data by such persons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Subparagraph (B) does not apply to technical data that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) constitutes a correction or change to data furnished by the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) relates to form, fit, or function;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) is necessary for operation, maintenance, installation, or training (other than detailed manufacturing or process data); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) is otherwise publicly available or has been released or disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor without restriction on further release or disclosure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Notwithstanding subparagraph (B), the United States may release or disclose technical data to persons outside the Government, or permit the use of technical data by such persons, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such release, disclosure, or use&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) is necessary for emergency repair and overhaul;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) is necessary for the segregation of an item or process from, or the reintegration of that item or process (or a physically or functionally equivalent item or process) with, other items or processes; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) is a release or disclosure of technical data (other than detailed manufacturing or process data) to, or use of such data by, a foreign government that is in the interest of the United States and is required for evaluational or informational purposes;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such release, disclosure, or use is made subject to a prohibition that the person to whom the data is released or disclosed may not further release, disclose, or use such data; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is notified of such release, disclosure, or use.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) In the case of an item or process that is developed in part with Federal funds and in part at private expense, the respective rights of the United States and of the contractor or subcontractor in technical data pertaining to such item or process shall be established as early in the acquisition process as practicable (preferably during contract negotiations). The United States shall have government purpose rights in such technical data, except in any case in which the Secretary of Defense determines, on the basis of criteria established in such regulations, that negotiation of different rights in such technical data would be in the best interest of the United States. The establishment of any such negotiated rights shall <!-- PDFPage:1269 -->be based upon consideration of all of the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The statement of congressional policy and objectives in section 200 of title 35, the statement of purposes in section 2(b) of the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 (15 U.S.C. 638 note), and the declaration of policy in section 2 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The interest of the United States in increasing competition and lowering costs by developing and locating alternative sources of supply and manufacture.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The interest of the United States in encouraging contractors to develop at private expense items for use by the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) Such other factors as the Secretary of Defense may prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) A contractor or subcontractor (or a prospective contractor or subcontractor) may not be required, as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for the award of a contract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to sell or otherwise relinquish to the United States any rights in technical data except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) rights in technical data described in subparagraph (A) for which a use or release restriction has been erroneously asserted by a contractor or subcontractor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) rights in technical data described in subparagraph (C); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) under the conditions described in subparagraph (D); or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to refrain from offering to use, or from using, an item or process to which the contractor is entitled to restrict rights in data under subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) The Secretary of Defense may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) negotiate and enter into a contract with a contractor or subcontractor for the acquisition of rights in technical data not otherwise provided under subparagraph (C) or (D), if necessary to develop alternative sources of supply and manufacture;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) agree to restrict rights in technical data otherwise accorded to the United States under this section if the United States receives a royalty-free license to use, release, or disclose the data for purposes of the United States (including purposes of competitive procurement); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) permit a contractor or subcontractor to license directly to a third party the use of technical data which the contractor is otherwise allowed to restrict, if necessary to develop alternative sources of supply and manufacture.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Defense shall define the terms &ldquo;developed&rdquo;, &ldquo;exclusively with Federal funds&rdquo;, and &ldquo;exclusively at private expense&rdquo; in regulations prescribed under paragraph (1). In defining such terms, the Secretary shall specify the manner in which indirect costs shall be treated and shall specify that amounts spent for independent research and development and bid and proposal costs shall not be considered to be Federal funds for the purposes of the definitions under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Regulations prescribed under subsection (a) shall require that, whenever practicable, a contract for supplies or services entered into by an agency named in section 2303 of this title contain appropriate provisions relating to technical data, including provisions&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) defining the respective rights of the United States and the contractor or subcontractor (at any tier) regarding any technical data to be delivered under the contract and providing that, in the case of a contract for a commercial item, the item shall be presumed to be developed at private expense unless shown otherwise in accordance with section 2321(f);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) specifying the technical data, if any, to be delivered under the contract and delivery schedules for such delivery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) establishing or referencing procedures for determining the acceptability of technical data to be delivered under the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) establishing separate contract line items for the technical data, if any, to be delivered under the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to the maximum practicable extent, identifying, in advance of delivery, technical data which is to be delivered with restrictions on the right of the United States to use such data;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) requiring the contractor to revise any technical data delivered under the contract to reflect engineering design changes made during the performance of the contract and affecting the form, fit, and function of the items specified in the contract and to deliver such revised technical data to an agency within a time specified in the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) establishing remedies to be available to the United States when technical data required to be delivered or made available under the contract is found to be incomplete or inadequate or to not satisfy the requirements of the contract concerning technical data;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) authorizing the head of the agency to withhold payments under the contract (or exercise such other remedies as the head of the agency considers appropriate) during any period if the contractor does not meet the requirements of the contract pertaining to the delivery of technical data;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) providing that, in addition to technical data that is already subject to a contract delivery requirement, the United States may require at any time the delivery of technical data that has been generated or utilized in the performance of a contract, and compensate the contractor only for reasonable costs incurred for having converted and delivered the data in the required form, upon a determination that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the technical data is needed for the purpose of reprocurement, sustainment, modification, or upgrade (including through competitive means) of a major system or subsystem thereof, a weapon system or subsystem thereof, or any noncommercial item or process; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the technical data&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) pertains to an item or process developed in whole or in part with Federal funds; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1270 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is necessary for the segregation of an item or process from, or the reintegration of that item or process (or a physically or functionally equivalent item or process) with, other items or processes; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) providing that the United States is not foreclosed from requiring the delivery of the technical data by a failure to challenge, in accordance with the requirements of section 2321(d) of this title, the contractor's assertion of a use or release restriction on the technical data.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Nothing in this section or in section 2305(d) of this title prohibits the Secretary of Defense from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prescribing standards for determining whether a contract entered into by the Department of Defense shall provide for a time to be specified in the contract after which the United States shall have the right to use (or have used) for any purpose of the United States all technical data required to be delivered to the United States under the contract or providing for such a period of time (not to exceed 7 years) as a negotiation objective;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) notwithstanding any limitation upon the license rights conveyed under subsection (a), allowing a covered Government support contractor access to and use of any technical data delivered under a contract for the sole purpose of furnishing independent and impartial advice or technical assistance directly to the Government in support of the Government's management and oversight of the program or effort to which such technical data relates; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) prescribing reasonable and flexible guidelines, including negotiation objectives, for the conduct of negotiations regarding the respective rights in technical data of the United States and the contractor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary of Defense shall by regulation establish programs which provide domestic business concerns an opportunity to purchase or borrow replenishment parts from the United States for the purpose of design replication or modification, to be used by such concerns in the submission of subsequent offers to sell the same or like parts to the United States. Nothing in this subsection limits the authority of the head of an agency to impose restrictions on such a program related to national security considerations, inventory needs of the United States, the improbability of future purchases of the same or like parts, or any additional restriction otherwise required by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary of Defense shall require program managers for major weapon systems and subsystems of major weapon systems to assess the long-term technical data needs of such systems and subsystems and establish corresponding acquisition strategies that provide for technical data rights needed to sustain such systems and subsystems over their life cycle. Such strategies may include the development of maintenance capabilities within the Department of Defense or competition for contracts for sustainment of such systems or subsystems. Assessments and corresponding acquisition strategies developed under this section with respect to a weapon system or subsystem shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) be developed before issuance of a contract solicitation for the weapon system or subsystem;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) address the merits of including a priced contract option for the future delivery of technical data that were not acquired upon initial contract award;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) address the potential for changes in the sustainment plan over the life cycle of the weapon system or subsystem; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) apply to weapon systems and subsystems that are to be supported by performance-based logistics arrangements as well as to weapons systems and subsystems that are to be supported by other sustainment approaches.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) In this section, the term &ldquo;covered Government support contractor&rdquo; means a contractor under a contract the primary purpose of which is to furnish independent and impartial advice or technical assistance directly to the Government in support of the Government's management and oversight of a program or effort (rather than to directly furnish an end item or service to accomplish a program or effort), which contractor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is not affiliated with the prime contractor or a first-tier subcontractor on the program or effort, or with any direct competitor of such prime contractor or any such first-tier subcontractor in furnishing end items or services of the type developed or produced on the program or effort; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) executes a contract with the Government agreeing to and acknowledging&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that proprietary or nonpublic technical data furnished will be accessed and used only for the purposes stated in that contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that the covered Government support contractor will enter into a non-disclosure agreement with the contractor to whom the rights to the technical data belong;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) that the covered Government support contractor will take all reasonable steps to protect the proprietary and nonpublic nature of the technical data furnished to the covered Government support contractor during the program or effort for the period of time in which the Government is restricted from disclosing the technical data outside of the Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) that a breach of that contract by the covered Government support contractor with regard to a third party's ownership or rights in such technical data may subject the covered Government support contractor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to criminal, civil, administrative, and contractual actions in law and equity for penalties, damages, and other appropriate remedies by the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to civil actions for damages and other appropriate remedies by the contractor or subcontractor whose technical data is affected by the breach; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) that such technical data provided to the covered Government support contractor under the authority of this section shall not be used by the covered Government support contractor to compete against the third <!-- PDFPage:1271 -->party for Government or non-Government contracts.</p>
