<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The military health care system of the Department of Defense and the Veterans Health Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs are national institutions that collectively manage more than 1,500 hospitals, clinics, and health care facilities worldwide to provide services to more than 11,000,000 beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In the post-Cold War era, these institutions are in a profound transition that involves challenging opportunities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) During the period from 1988 to 1998, the number of military medical personnel has declined by 15 percent and the number of military hospitals has been reduced by one-third.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) During the 2 years since 1996, the Department of Veterans Affairs has revitalized its structure by decentralizing authority into 22 Veterans Integrated Service Networks.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) In the face of increasing costs of medical care, increased demands for health care services, and increasing budgetary constraints, the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs have embarked on a variety of dynamic and innovative cooperative programs ranging from shared services to joint venture operations of medical facilities.</p>
