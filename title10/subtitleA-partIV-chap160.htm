<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Involvement in Defense Environmental Restoration Program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a technical review committee or restoration advisory board is established with respect to an installation (or group of installations), the Secretary shall consult with and seek the advice of the committee or board on the following issues:</p>
