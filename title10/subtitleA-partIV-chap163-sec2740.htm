<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A case in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the lost or damaged goods were stored or transported under a contract, tender, or solicitation in accordance with section 2636a of this title that requires the transportation service provider to settle claims on the basis of full replacement value; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the loss or damage occurred under circumstances that exclude the transportation service provider from liability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A case in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the loss or damage occurred while the lost or damaged goods were in the possession of an ocean carrier that was transporting, loading, or unloading the goods under a Department of Defense contract for ocean carriage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the land-based portions of the transportation were under contracts, in accordance with section 2636a of this title, that require the land carriers to settle claims on the basis of full replacement value.</p>
