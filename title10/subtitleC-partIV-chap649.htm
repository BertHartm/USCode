The itemization of personnel categories for whom quarters may be furnished is inserted to execute the definition of &ldquo;naval personnel&rdquo;, made applicable to this section by 5 U.S.C. 421g.

The words &ldquo;basic allowance for quarters of an officer of his grade&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;his quarters allowance&rdquo; because, under the Career Compensation Act of 1949, members without dependents are not entitled to a quarters allowance when on sea duty, and the limitation must be based upon the allowance of an officer of the same grade who is entitled thereto.</p>
