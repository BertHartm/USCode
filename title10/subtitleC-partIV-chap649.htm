<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the word &ldquo;public&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;possessed by the United States&rdquo; and the subsection is phrased in terms of availability, as it is so interpreted. The itemization of personnel categories for whom quarters may be furnished is inserted to execute the definition of &ldquo;naval personnel&rdquo;, made applicable to this section by 5 U.S.C. 421g. The requirement in that definition that personnel be on active duty is omitted since this subsection applies only to personnel on sea duty.</p>

The words &ldquo;in obtaining quarters&rdquo; are inserted for clarity. The words &ldquo;basic allowance for quarters of an officer of his grade&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;his quarters allowance&rdquo; because, under the Career Compensation Act of 1949, members without dependents are not entitled to a quarters allowance when on sea duty, and the limitation must be based upon the allowance of an officer of the same grade who is entitled thereto.</p>
