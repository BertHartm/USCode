<p class="note-body">In the introductory paragraph, the applicability of the rule stated in the third sentence to situations not expressly covered by the laws named in the source statutes above is a practical construction that the rule must be reciprocally applied in all cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">In formula No. 1, the words &ldquo;whichever is earlier&rdquo;, in 37:272(d) (clause (2)), are omitted, since they are contrary to the rule stated in 37:272(e) (1st proviso of last sentence).</p>
<p class="note-body">In formula No. 3, the computation is based on monthly pay instead of annual pay to conform to the other formulas of the revised section. The words &ldquo;basic pay&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;base and longevity pay&rdquo; to conform to the terminology of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.). The words &ldquo;which he would receive if serving, at the time granted such pay, on active duty&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage and to conform to the other formulas of the revised section, since the effect of these words is covered by footnote 1. The words &ldquo;at any time&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;during his entire period of service&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Footnotes 1 and 2 reflect the long-standing construction of those provisions dealing with computation of retired pay which do not specifically provide that the member is entitled to compute his retired pay on the basis of the monthly basic pay to which he would be entitled if he were on active duty in his retired grade. The pertinent basic computation provisions for such retirement either provide for computation of retired pay on the same basis as the provisions dealing with higher retired grade, or the basic retirement provisions were enacted after the provisions authorizing higher retired grade. The words &ldquo;at rates applicable on date of retirement *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and adjust to reflect later changes in permanent rates&rdquo;, in footnote 1; and all of footnote 2; are based on the source statutes incorporated in the formulas to which footnotes 1 and 2 apply, as interpreted in an opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (1953/4120, 14 May 1953).</p>
<p class="note-body">In footnote 3, the words &ldquo;and disregard a part of a year that is less than six months&rdquo; are made applicable to formulas Nos. 1 and 2. The legislative history of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (Hearings before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on H.R. 5007, 81st Congress, First Session, page 313, July 6, 1949) indicates that the provisions, upon which formulas Nos. 1 and 2 are based, should be construed to require that a fraction of less than one-half of a year be disregarded. It also indicates that other retirement laws that are also silent on this point should be similarly construed.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 99&ndash;348, &sect;201(a)(4), substituted in column 2 of table a multiplier of the retired pay multiplier prescribed in section 1409(a) for the years of service credited to him under section 1405 for a multiplier of 21/2% of years of service credited under section 1405 for formulas 4 and 5 and struck out &ldquo;Excess over 75% of pay upon which computation is based.&rdquo; in column 4 of table for formulas 4 and 5.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1962 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">The change corrects a typographical error.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">1982 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amends 10:1405 to correct an inadvertent error in the codification of title 10 in 1956 relating to retirement pay of warrant officers advanced on the retired list. Under provisions of law first enacted in 1948 through the codification of title 10 in 1956 and until 1965, warrant officers advanced on the retired list received credit for inactive service in the computation of retirement pay. The Comptroller General in 1965 (B&ndash;156576) held in effect that computation of such retirement pay was governed by the wording of new title 10 that based the computation on years of active service only even though this had the result of making a substantive change. The Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives concurs that an error was made in the codification of title 10 and has indicated that corrective legislative action is properly a responsibility of the House Judiciary Committee. See, also, the amendments to 10:3992 and 8992 made by sections 1(40) and 1(52), respectively.</p>

A court may not treat retired pay as property in any proceeding to divide or partition any amount of retired pay of a member as the property of the member and the member's spouse or former spouse if a final decree of divorce, dissolution, annulment, or legal separation (including a court ordered, ratified, or approved property settlement incident to such decree) affecting the member and the member's spouse or former spouse (A) was issued before June 25, 1981, and (B) did not treat (or reserve jurisdiction to treat) any amount of retired pay of the member as property of the member and the member's spouse or former spouse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this section does not create any right, title, or interest which can be sold, assigned, transferred, or otherwise disposed of (including by inheritance) by a spouse or former spouse. Payments by the Secretary concerned under subsection (d) to a spouse or former spouse with respect to a division of retired pay as the property of a member and the member's spouse under this subsection may not be treated as amounts received as retired pay for service in the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This section does not authorize any court to order a member to apply for retirement or retire at a particular time in order to effectuate any payment under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A court may not treat the disposable retired pay of a member in the manner described in paragraph (1) unless the court has jurisdiction over the member by reason of (A) his residence, other than because of military assignment, in the territorial jurisdiction of the court, (B) his domicile in the territorial jurisdiction of the court, or (C) his consent to the jurisdiction of the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Payments by Secretary Concerned To Spouse or Former Spouse</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) After effective service on the Secretary concerned of a court order providing for the payment of child support or alimony or, with respect to a division of property, specifically providing for the payment of an amount of the disposable retired pay from a member to the spouse or a former spouse of the member, the Secretary shall make payments (subject to the limitations of this section) from the disposable retired pay of the member to the spouse or former spouse in an amount sufficient to satisfy the amount of child support and alimony set forth in the court order and, with respect to a division of property, in the amount of disposable retired pay specifically provided for in the court order. In the case of a member entitled to receive retired pay on the date of the effective service of the court order, such payments shall begin not later than 90 days after the date of effective service. In the case of a member not entitled to receive retired pay on the date of the effective service of the court order, such payments shall begin not later than 90 days after the date on which the member first becomes entitled to receive retired pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the spouse or former spouse to whom payments are to be made under this section was not married to the member for a period of 10 years or more during which the member performed at least 10 years of service creditable in determining the member's eligibility for retired pay, payments may not be made under this section to the extent that they include an amount resulting from the treatment by the court under subsection (c) of disposable retired pay of the member as property of the member or property of the member and his spouse.</p>

The resumption of payments shall begin as of the first day of the month in which that marriage is so terminated. The monthly amount of the payments shall be the amount that would have been paid if the continuity of the payments had not been interrupted by the marriage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Payments in accordance with this subsection shall be made out of funds in the Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund established by section 1461 of this title or, in the case of the Coast Guard, out of funds appropriated to the Department of Transportation for payment of retired pay for the Coast Guard.</p>
