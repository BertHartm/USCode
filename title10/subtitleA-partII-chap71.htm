<p class="note-body">In the introductory paragraph, the applicability of the rule stated in the third sentence to situations not expressly covered by the laws named in the source statutes above is a practical construction that the rule must be reciprocally applied in all cases.</p>
<p class="note-body">In formula No. 1, the words &ldquo;whichever is earlier&rdquo;, in 37:272(d) (clause (2)), are omitted, since they are contrary to the rule stated in 37:272(e) (1st proviso of last sentence).</p>
<p class="note-body">In formula No. 3, the computation is based on monthly pay instead of annual pay to conform to the other formulas of the revised section. The words &ldquo;basic pay&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;base and longevity pay&rdquo; to conform to the terminology of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.). The words &ldquo;which he would receive if serving, at the time granted such pay, on active duty&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage and to conform to the other formulas of the revised section, since the effect of these words is covered by footnote 1. The words &ldquo;at any time&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;during his entire period of service&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Footnotes 1 and 2 reflect the long-standing construction of those provisions dealing with computation of retired pay which do not specifically provide that the member is entitled to compute his retired pay on the basis of the monthly basic pay to which he would be entitled if he were on active duty in his retired grade. The pertinent basic computation provisions for such retirement either provide for computation of retired pay on the same basis as the provisions dealing with higher retired grade, or the basic retirement provisions were enacted after the provisions authorizing higher retired grade. The words &ldquo;at rates applicable on date of retirement  and adjust to reflect later changes in permanent rates&rdquo;, in footnote 1; and all of footnote 2; are based on the source statutes incorporated in the formulas to which footnotes 1 and 2 apply, as interpreted in an opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (1953/4120, 14 May 1953).</p>
<p class="note-body">In footnote 3, the words &ldquo;and disregard a part of a year that is less than six months&rdquo; are made applicable to formulas Nos. 1 and 2. The legislative history of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (Hearings before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on H.R. 5007, 81st Congress, First Session, page 313, July 6, 1949) indicates that the provisions, upon which formulas Nos. 1 and 2 are based, should be construed to require that a fraction of less than one-half of a year be disregarded. It also indicates that other retirement laws that are also silent on this point should be similarly construed.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1982 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">This amends 10:1405 to correct an inadvertent error in the codification of title 10 in 1956 relating to retirement <!-- PDFPage:789 -->pay of warrant officers advanced on the retired list. Under provisions of law first enacted in 1948 through the codification of title 10 in 1956 and until 1965, warrant officers advanced on the retired list received credit for inactive service in the computation of retirement pay. The Comptroller General in 1965 (B&ndash;156576) held in effect that computation of such retirement pay was governed by the wording of new title 10 that based the computation on years of active service only even though this had the result of making a substantive change. The Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives concurs that an error was made in the codification of title 10 and has indicated that corrective legislative action is properly a responsibility of the House Judiciary Committee.

In the case of a member not entitled to receive retired pay on the date of the effective service of the court order, such payments shall begin not later than 90 days after the date on which the member first becomes entitled to receive retired pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the spouse or former spouse to whom payments are to be made under this section was not married to the member for a period of 10 years or more during which the member performed at least 10 years of service creditable in determining the member's eligibility for retired pay, payments may not be made under this section to the extent that they include an amount resulting from the treatment by the court under subsection (c) of disposable retired pay of the member as property of the member or property of the member and his spouse.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A court order shall be considered to be an out-of-State modification for purposes of this paragraph if the order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) modifies a previous court order under this section upon which payments under this subsection are based; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) is issued by a court of a State other than the State of the court that issued the previous court order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) pay to that member the amount which is equal to the amount of that member's disposable retired pay (less any amount paid during such month pursuant to legal process served under section 459 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 659) and any amount paid during such month pursuant to court orders effectively served under this section, other than such conflicting court orders) minus&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the amount of disposable retired pay paid under clause (i); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the amount of disposable retired pay retained under clause (ii).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary concerned shall hold the amount retained under clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) until such time as that Secretary is provided with a court order which has been certified by the member and the spouse or former spouse to be valid and applicable to the retained amount.

Such court orders and legal process shall be satisfied out of moneys which are subject to such orders and legal process and which remain available in accordance with the limitations of paragraph (1) and subparagraph (B) of this paragraph during such month after the satisfaction of all court orders or legal process which have been previously served.</p>

Any such unsatisfied obligation of a member may be enforced by any means available under law other than the means provided under this section in any case in which the maximum amount permitted under paragraph (1) has been paid and under section 459 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 659) in any case in which the maximum amount permitted under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (4) has been paid.</p>
