<h4 class="note-head">Support for Scout Jamborees</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;148, div. A, title VIII, &sect;8126(c)(1), Dec. 30, 2005, 119 Stat. 2729, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(A) Section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States commits exclusively to Congress the powers to raise and support armies, provide and maintain a Navy, and make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Under those powers conferred by section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States to provide, support, and maintain the Armed Forces, it lies within the discretion of Congress to provide opportunities to train the Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) The primary purpose of the Armed Forces is to defend our national security and prepare for combat should the need arise.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(D) One of the most critical elements in defending the Nation and preparing for combat is training in conditions that simulate the preparation, logistics, and leadership required for defense and combat.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(E) Support for youth organization events simulates the preparation, logistics, and leadership required for defending our national security and preparing for combat.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(F) For example, Boy Scouts of America's National Scout Jamboree is a unique training event for the Armed Forces, as it requires the construction, maintenance, and disassembly of a &lsquo;tent city&rsquo; capable of supporting tens of thousands of people for a week or longer. Camporees at the United States Military Academy for Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts provide similar training opportunities on a smaller scale.&rdquo;</p>
