<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the word &ldquo;members&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;officers and enlisted men&rdquo; in 10:1237. Clause (2) is substituted for 10:904. 32:156 is omitted as covered by 10:904, since the words &ldquo;officers of the Army&rdquo; necessarily cover all persons named in 32:156. The words &ldquo;the Secretary of the Army or a person designated by him&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;by whatever branch, office, or officers of the Army the Secretary of the Army may from time to time designate&rdquo;, inserted by the Editors of the United States Code. R.S. 1114 which provided that this function should be invested in the Inspector General was not amended in this respect by section 402(a) of the Army Organization Act of 1950 (64 Stat. 272). However, these functions have now been transferred to the Secretary of the Army or a person designated by him. (See memorandum of the Secretary of Defense, dated October 29, 1954, subject &ldquo;Transfer of Authority from the Inspector General to the Secretary of the Army to Designate Subsistence Articles for Sale,&rdquo; and opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1954/9712, 2 December 1954).) The words &ldquo;Except for articles and items acquired through the use of working capital funds under sections 172&ndash;172j of title 5&rdquo; are inserted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as <!-- PDFPage:1440 -->amended (63 Stat. 585), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses. (See opinion of the Assistant General Counsel (Fiscal Matters) of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, January 4, 1955.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the first sentence states expressly the rule which is implicit in 10:1238. The word &ldquo;members&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;officers and enlisted men&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;shall be understood, in all cases of such sales&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The last sentence is inserted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (63 Stat. 585), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses. (See opinion of the Deputy General Counsel of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, March 28, 1956.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the word &ldquo;members&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;officers and enlisted men&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;prices at which like property is sold to&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;same price as is charged the&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (c) and (d), the words &ldquo;other armed forces&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;Navy and Marine Corps&rdquo;, since such sales are authorized to members of the Coast Guard by section 144(b) of title 14.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words &ldquo;other than subsistence supplies&rdquo; are inserted, since the sale of subsistence supplies is covered by subsection (c).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words &ldquo;a person who has been discharged&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;discharged officers and enlisted men&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;Navy *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* or Marine Corps&rdquo;, omitted from the 1952 Edition of the United States Code, are inserted to conform to the source statute. The words &ldquo;may buy&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;shall *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* be permitted to purchase&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;at the prices at which like property is sold&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;at the same price as charged&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;member&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;officers and enlisted men&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;while undergoing such care and treatment&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f), the words &ldquo;person who has been discharged&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;former members *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* who have been separated therefrom&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;at the prices at which like articles are sold to members&rdquo; are inserted to conform to the last sentence of subsection (a) and subsection (e).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (g), the words &ldquo;regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;Army Regulations&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;of the Government&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. 10:1253 (last 22 words of 1st sentence) is omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;or to another executive department of the Government&rdquo; are omitted as superseded by section 7 of the Act of May 21, 1920, ch. 194, as amended (31 U.S.C. 686). The provisions of 10:1253 relating to computation of costs are omitted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (63 Stat. 585), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses. (See opinion of the Assistant General Counsel (Fiscal Matters) of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, January 4, 1955.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (h), the word &ldquo;outside&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;beyond the continental limitations&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;or in Alaska&rdquo; are omitted, since, under section 101(1) of this title, the words &ldquo;United States&rdquo; are defined to include only the States and the District of Columbia. The word &ldquo;continental&rdquo;, after the words &ldquo;within the&rdquo;, is omitted for the same reason. The last sentence is substituted for 10:1241 (proviso).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (i), 10:1196 (last 30 words) is omitted as superseded by the Act of April 27, 1914, ch. 72 (last proviso under &ldquo;Subsistence of the Army&rdquo;), 38 Stat. 361. The words &ldquo;So much of the&rdquo; and &ldquo;as may be necessary&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;members *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* on active duty, for the use of themselves and their families&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;officers for the use of themselves and their families, and to commanders of companies or other organizations, for the use of the enlisted men of their companies or organizations&rdquo;, to conform to 10:1237 and 1238. Those sections provide the basic authority for procurement and sale of subsistence supplies to all members. This interpretation conforms to established administrative practice under those sections. The word &ldquo;supplies&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;stores&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) As soon as practicable after the collection of the effects and money of the deceased, the summary court-martial shall send them at the expense of the United States to the living person highest on the following list who can be found by the court:</p>

<p class="note-body">Before the enactment of the National Security Act of 1947, the transport functions covered by this section were performed only by the Army. Under section 2(a)(3) <!-- PDFPage:1452 -->of the National Security Act (as it existed before August 10, 1949), the sea and air transportation functions of the Army, Navy, and Air Force were respectively consolidated into the &ldquo;Military Sea Transportation Service&rdquo;, under the Department of the Navy, and the &ldquo;Military Air Transport Service&rdquo;, under the Department of the Air Force. Instead of having space on its own transport vessels and airplanes, the Army is now allotted bulk space on vessels and airplanes operated by those transport services. The words &ldquo;or, within bulk space allocations made to the Department of the Army, on vessels or airplanes operated by any military transport agency of the Department of Defense&rdquo; are inserted, in accordance with an opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1953/5885, 22 July 1953), to make clear that the rule applicable to Army vessels and airplanes applies to the bulk space allocated to the Army. Since the authority to perform transportation functions could again be transferred as between the military departments, the reference to &ldquo;vessels or airplanes of Army transport agencies&rdquo; is retained. The word &ldquo;considers&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;in the opinion of&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;Persons residing in Alaska who are and have been employed there by the United States&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;employees of the United States, residing in Alaska, who have been in such employment&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;civil&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;from and after November 21, 1941&rdquo;, &ldquo;and the carriage of all such air traffic shall be terminated&rdquo;, &ldquo;dire&rdquo;, &ldquo;the privilege herein granted&rdquo;, and &ldquo;as to each eligible individual&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.

The words &ldquo;from each officer to whom he was accountable or responsible for property&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;from only such of the bureaus of the Department of the Army to which the property for which they were accountable or responsible pertains&rdquo;, since there is no longer a bureau structure within the Department of the Army. The words &ldquo;that he is not accountable or responsible for property to any other officer&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;accompanied by the affidavits of officers, of nonaccountability or nonresponsibility to other bureaus of the Department of the Army&rdquo;, for the same reason. The reference to certificates from the General Accounting Office is omitted as obsolete. The last sentence is substituted for 10:878 (last 18 words). The last proviso of section 2 of the act of January 12, 1899, ch. 46, 30 Stat. 784, is not contained in 10:878. It is also omitted from the revised section, since it related to authority of mustering officers to administer oaths and the general authority to administer oaths is now contained in section 936 of this title (article 136 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice).</p>
