Relinquishment of legislative jurisdiction under this section may be accomplished (1) by filing with the Governor (or, if none exists, with the chief executive officer) of the State, Commonwealth, territory, or possession concerned a notice of relinquishment to take effect upon acceptance thereof, or (2) as the laws of the State, Commonwealth, territory, or possession may otherwise provide.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The authority granted by subsection (a) is in addition to and not instead of that granted by any other provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), the Secretary concerned shall establish and enforce as the minimum drinking age on a military installation located in a State the age established by the law of that State as the State minimum drinking age.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) In this subsection:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;State&rdquo; includes the District of Columbia.</p>
