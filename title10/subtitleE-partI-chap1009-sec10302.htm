<p class="statutory-body">(a) There is in the Office of the Secretary of the Army an Army Reserve Forces Policy Committee. The Committee shall review and comment upon major policy matters directly affecting the reserve components and the mobilization preparedness of the Army. The Committee's comments on such policy matters shall accompany the final report regarding any such matters submitted to the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Committee consists of officers in the grade of colonel or above, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) five members of the Regular Army on duty with the Army General Staff;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) five members of the Army National Guard of the United States not on active duty; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) five members of the Army Reserve not on active duty.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The members of the Committee shall select the Chairman from among the members on the Committee not on active duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A majority of the members of the Committee shall act whenever matter affecting both the Army National Guard of the United States and Army Reserve are being considered.
