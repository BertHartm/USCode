<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary of Defense shall encourage the use of energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy as a source of energy for military construction projects (including military family housing projects) where use of such form of energy would be practical and economically feasible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary concerned shall require that the design of all new facilities (including <!-- PDFPage:1407 -->family housing) shall include consideration of energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy in those cases in which use of such forms of energy has the potential for reduced energy costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary concerned shall require that contracts for construction resulting from such design include a requirement that energy systems using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy be installed if such systems can be shown to be cost effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) For the purposes of this section, an energy system using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy for a facility shall be considered to be cost effective if the difference between (A) the original investment cost of the energy system for the facility with such a system, and (B) the original investment cost of the energy system for the facility without such a system can be recovered over the expected life of the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A determination under paragraph (1) concerning whether a cost-differential can be recovered over the expected life of a facility shall be made using the life-cycle cost methods and procedures established pursuant to section 544(a) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8254(a)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In order to equip a military construction project (including a military family housing project) with heating equipment, cooling equipment, or both heating and cooling equipment using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy or with a passive energy system using solar energy or other renewable forms of energy, the Secretary concerned may authorize an increase in any otherwise applicable limitation with respect to the number of square feet or the cost per square foot of the project by such amount as may be necessary for such purpose.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) To achieve the goal designated under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall develop a comprehensive plan to identify and accomplish energy conservation measures to achieve maximum cost-effective energy savings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purpose of implementing any energy performance plan, the Secretary shall provide that the selection of energy conservation measures, including energy efficient maintenance or water efficient maintenance, under such plan shall be limited to those with a positive net present value over a period of 10 years or less.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In paragraph (3), the term &ldquo;energy efficient maintenance or water efficient maintenance&rdquo; includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the repair by replacement of equipment or systems, such as lighting, heating, or cooling equipment or systems, industrial processes, or water efficiency applications, with technology that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) will achieve the most cost-effective energy savings over the life-cycle of the equipment or system being repaired; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) will meet the same end needs as the equipment or system being repaired; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) improvements in an operation or maintenance process, such as improved training or improved controls, that result in reduced costs through energy savings or water cost savings.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Use of Energy Cost Savings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An amount of the funds appropriated to the Department of Defense for a fiscal year that is equal to the amount of energy cost savings realized by the Department, including financial benefits resulting from shared energy savings contracts, shall remain available for obligation under paragraph (2) until expended, without additional authorization or appropriation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall provide that the amount that remains available for obligation under paragraph (1) and section 2866(a)(3) of this title, and the funds made available under section 2867(b)(2) of this title, shall be used as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) One-half of the amount shall be used for the implementation of additional energy conservation measures and for water conservation activities at such buildings, facilities, or installations of the Department of Defense as may be designated (in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense) by the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality that realized the savings referred to in paragraph (1) or in section 2866(a)(3) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) One-half of the amount shall be used at the installation at which the savings were realized, as determined by the commanding officer of such installation consistent with applicable law and regulations, for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) improvements to existing military family housing units;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) any unspecified minor construction project that will enhance the quality of life of personnel; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Shared Energy Savings Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall develop a simplified method of contracting for shared energy savings contract services that will accelerate the use of these contracts with respect to military installations and will reduce the administrative effort and cost on the part of the Department as well as the private sector.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Subject to paragraph (4), the Secretary of Defense may authorize the Secretary of a military department having jurisdiction over a military installation to enter into agreements with gas or electric utilities to design and implement cost-effective demand and conservation incentive programs (including energy management services, facilities alterations, and the installation and maintenance of energy saving devices and technologies by the utilities) to address the requirements and circumstances of the installation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If an agreement under paragraph (3) provides for a utility to advance financing costs for the design or implementation of a program referred to in that paragraph to be repayed by the United States, the cost of such advance may be recovered by the utility under terms no less favorable than those applicable to its most favored customer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense may authorize a military installation to accept a financial incentive (including an agreement to reduce the amount of a future water bill), goods, or services generally available from a utility, for the purpose of adopting technologies and practices that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) relate to the management of water demand or to water conservation; and</p>
