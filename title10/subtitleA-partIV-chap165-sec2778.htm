In clause (1)(A), the words &ldquo;regard to&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;military departments&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force&rdquo; because of 10:101(7). The title of Secretary of War was changed to Secretary of the Army by section 205(a) of the Act of July 26, 1947 (ch. 343, 61 Stat. 501), and by sections 1 and 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956 (ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 157, 676).

In clause (4), the words &ldquo;deem necessary and&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
