<p class="statutory-body">(a) No enlisted member of the Army may sell, lend, pledge, barter, or give any clothing, arms, or equipment furnished him by the United States to any person other than a member of the Army, or an officer of the United States, authorized to receive it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If a member of the Army has disposed of property in violation of subsection (a) and it is in the possession of a person who is neither a member of the Army, nor an officer of the United States, authorized to receive it, that person has no right to or interest in the property, and any civil or military officer of the United States may seize it, wherever found. Possession of such property furnished by the United States to a member of the Army, by a person who is neither a member of the Army nor an officer of the United States, is prima facie evidence that it has been disposed of in violation of subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If an officer who seizes property under subsection (b) is not authorized to retain it for the United States, he shall deliver it to a person who is authorized to retain it.</p>
