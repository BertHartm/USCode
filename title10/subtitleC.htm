<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the language that incorporates the rank, pay, and allowances of chiefs of bureaus of the War Department for chiefs of bureaus is executed. Creation of the Department of the Air Force by the National Security Act of 1947, and the saving provisions in &sect;305 of that act, would relate chiefs of bureaus of the Navy to the corresponding officers of both the other military departments. Since there is now positive organizational law for both of those departments providing the grades of the departmental officers, and, since in the reorganization of the departments, there is no precise counterpart of the chief of a Navy bureau, it is inappropriate to continue the incorporation by reference. Subsection (a), therefore, provides that bureau chiefs are entitled to have the rank of rear admiral with pay and allowances of a rear admiral in the upper half, which, under &sect;516 of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, corresponds with major general. The subsection also recognizes the possibility of appointing an officer of the Marine Corps as Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics by providing that such an appointee has the rank, pay, and allowances of a major general.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;from officers on the active list of the Navy in the Medical Corps&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;from the list of Surgeons of the Navy&rdquo; to conform to present statutory terminology, and the words &ldquo;or from officers having the rank of captain in the staff corps of the Navy&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete in view of the subsequent changes in staff corps grades and the establishment of grades and ranks higher than captain in the staff corps. R.S. 421 and 426 were derived from the Act of July 5, 1862, ch. 134, 12 Stat. 510, and the Act of Mar. 3, 1871, ch. 117, &sect;10, 16 Stat. 537. The Act of July 5, 1862, provided that the Chief of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery should be appointed from the list of surgeons in the Navy. At that time the senior medical officers were &ldquo;surgeons&rdquo; who &ldquo;ranked with&rdquo; commanders. Next junior to them were &ldquo;surgeons&rdquo; who &ldquo;ranked with&rdquo; lieutenants. The rank of lieutenant commander did not exist. The Act of Mar. 3, 1871, established five grades in the Medical Corps of which two, medical director and medical inspector, were higher than the grade of surgeon. Medical directors were given the relative rank of captain, medical inspectors the relative rank of commander, and surgeons the relative rank of lieutenant commander or lieutenant. The 1871 Act further provided that chiefs of bureaus might be appointed from officers having the relative rank of captain in the staff corps. This provision was probably intended to insure that the assignment of new grades and titles to senior staff corps officers should not be construed as a bar to their appointment as bureau chiefs. However, it was interpreted by the Commissioners who drafted the Revised Statutes as setting up a new category of officers from which bureau chiefs could be appointed, and it was therefore stated, in R.S. 421, as an alternative to each of the other categories specified for the various Bureaus in the 1862 Act and reenacted in R.S. 422&ndash;426. Thus the Chief of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery could be appointed from surgeons, who had the relative rank of lieutenant commander or lieutenant in the Medical Corps, or from officers having the relative rank of captain in the Medical Corps, Pay Corps, or Engineer Corps. Section 405 of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 (34 U.S.C. 10a) abolished the grade of surgeon and other staff corps grades and replaced them with grades having the same titles as the grades and ranks in the line. Officers who were &ldquo;surgeons&rdquo; are now &ldquo;lieutenant commanders and lieutenants in the Medical Corps.&rdquo; If this literal translation is made in R.S. 426 and the eligibility of all staff corps captains, as stated in R.S. 421, is retained, an absurd result is reached; i.e., lieutenants, lieutenant commanders, and captains in the Medical Corps are eligible for appointment as Chief of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery; but commanders and rear admirals in that corps are ineligible; captains, but not rear admirals, in other staff corps are eligible by virtue of their rank alone, regardless of their lack of training in medicine. It appears, therefore, that the only reasonable meaning that can be given to R.S. 421 and 426 at the present time is that the Chief of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery must be an officer of the Medical Corps.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the words &ldquo;Deputy Chief of the Bureau&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;assistant to the Bureau&rdquo; for uniformity. The words &ldquo;An officer on the active list of the Navy in the Medical Corps&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;A surgeon, assistant surgeon, or passed assistant surgeon&rdquo; to conform to present statutory terminology and to describe clearly the class of officers eligible for detail under this subsection. When <!-- PDFPage:1244 -->the source statute was enacted there was no class of officers exactly corresponding to officers of the present Naval Reserve, and retired officers could be called to active duty only in time of war, so that the detailing of an officer not on the active list as assistant to the bureau chief was probably not contemplated. Further, since the assistant or deputy must at times perform the duties of the chief, it is reasonable to assume that he was intended to be in the same category of officers. Later statutes relating to the Assistant Chiefs of the Bureau of Aeronautics and the Bureau of Ships, enacted at a time when there were Reserve officers and when retired officers could be called to duty at any time with their consent, specify that the assistant chiefs shall be officers on the active list.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;from officers on the active list in the line of the Navy&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;from the list of officers of the Navy&rdquo; to conform to current terminology. Line officers alone had the &ldquo;grade&rdquo; of commander when the source statute was enacted. The words &ldquo;or from officers having the rank of captain in the staff corps of the Navy&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete in view of subsequent changes in the staff corps and in the staff corps ranks and grades. These words were derived from the Act of Mar. 3, 1871, ch. 117, &sect;10, 16 Stat. 537, which established new staff corps grades and assigned to officers in the highest grade the relative rank of captain. They were probably intended merely to assure the eligibility of senior staff corps officers for appointment as chiefs of appropriate staff bureaus. However, as incorporated in R.S. 421, they provide a category of eligible officers which is an alternative to each of the categories listed in R.S. 422&ndash;426. Thus R.S. 421 and R.S. 422, as originally enacted, provided that the chiefs of the four &ldquo;line&rdquo; bureaus, Yards and Docks, Navigation, Ordnance, and Equipment and Recruiting, could be appointed from line officers not below the grade of commander or from officers having the relative rank of captain in any staff corps. Pursuant to these sections the Attorney General held in 1898 that an officer having the relative rank of captain in the Civil Engineer Corps could legally be appointed as Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (22 Op. Atty. Gen. 47, 17 Mar. 1898). There is some confusion in the opinion as to which corps was meant. The proposed appointee was a member of the Civil Engineer Corps, but the Corps of Engineers is the corps mentioned in the conclusion of the opinion. A provision in the Act of June 29, 1906, ch. 3590, 34 Stat. 564, requires that the Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks be selected from officers of the Civil Engineer Corps, so that there is no longer any question as to that bureau. The Bureau of Equipment and Recruiting has been abolished, leaving only the Bureau of Naval Personnel (formerly Navigation) and the Bureau of Ordnance of the four &ldquo;line&rdquo; bureaus originally listed in R.S. 422. The statutes establishing new &ldquo;line&rdquo; bureaus, the Bureau of Ships and the Bureau of Aeronautics, contain their own requirements as to the qualifications of the chiefs. The abolition of the Corps of Engineers and the Construction Corps, with the transfer of officers in those corps to the line, has eliminated the only staff corps whose members had duties closely related to those of line officers. The present staff corps, with the possible exception of the Supply Corps, are all highly specialized. Furthermore, in five of the seven corps, captain is no longer the highest grade. In view of these facts it is considered that the provision of R.S. 421 making staff corps captains eligible for appointment as Chief of the Bureaus of Naval Personnel and Ordnance is obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the words &ldquo;An officer on the active list in the line of the Navy not below the grade of commander&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;An officer of the Navy not below the rank of commander&rdquo; to conform to current terminology and for clarity. When the source statute was enacted only line officers had the actual rank of commander. The words &ldquo;on the active list&rdquo; are inserted for the reasons stated in the revision note on &sect;5137(b) of this title. The words &ldquo;Deputy Chief&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;assistant to the Chief&rdquo; for the reason stated in the revision note on &sect;5134 of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the rank, pay, allowances, and privileges of retirement of chiefs of bureaus of the Navy are incorporated. 5 U.S.C. 441 apparently relates the Judge Advocate General of the Navy to the Judge Advocate General of the Army, as well as to bureau chiefs. However, since the creation of the Department of the Air Force by the National Security Act of 1947, if the incorporation to the Army provision is retained, the saving provisions in the act require an incorporation also to the rank, etc., of the Judge Advocate General of the Air Force. The rank of the Judge Advocate General of each of the other departments is now specified in organizational law to be major general. Since it is possible that these ranks may at some future time not be the same, incorporation by reference to them is no longer appropriate. Instead, the section relates the Judge Advocate General's rank, pay, allowances, and privileges of retirement to those of bureau chiefs as does 5 U.S.C. 441, in part.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), clauses (1) and (4) are substituted for the words &ldquo;and perform such other duties as have heretofore been performed by the Solicitor and Naval Judge Advocate General&rdquo; to describe the duties of the Judge Advocate General directly instead of by reference to the duties performed by an officer whose office was abolished more than 75 years ago.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c)(2) is substituted for the reference, in 5 U.S.C. 428, to courts-martial and courts of inquiry, since the Uniform Code of Military Justice has superseded prior law as to the duties of the Judge Advocates General relating to these courts.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">This section is derived from the distribution-in-grade provisions of the Officers Personnel Act of 1947. It is inserted here to show clearly what is meant by the &ldquo;authorized number&rdquo; of officers in a grade as used in the distribution-in-grade sections of the Officer Personnel Act. &ldquo;Prescribed number&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;authorized number&rdquo; because the latter, as used in other provisions of law, means simply the maximum number of persons authorized to be in a designated category. As used in the distribution-in-grade provisions of the Officer Personnel Act the term means not only the maximum number of officers that may be in a particular grade, but also the number of officers that should be maintained in that grade. It places not only a ceiling but a floor on the number of officers for the grade concerned. This is accomplished by establishing vacancies when the actual number of officers in the grade concerned falls below the &ldquo;authorized&rdquo; or, as used here, the &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; number. Where there is a prescribed number for a grade, an officer should, in the absence of other controlling provisions of law, be promoted to that grade to fill an existing vacancy, as of the date on which the vacancy occurred. In this manner, at least constructively, the prescribed number is maintained.</p>
<p class="note-body">There is no source for the section because the Officer Personnel Act did not attempt specifically to define &ldquo;authorized number&rdquo; in this context. The meaning of the term is derived only from understanding the effect given it throughout the Officer Personnel Act and from the imperative requirements of sections 103, 203, and 303 of the act.</p>

<p class="note-body">The Act of July 24, 1941, ch. 320, as amended (34 U.S.C. 350 et seq.), and &sect;413 of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 (34 U.S.C. 211d) provide for the temporary appointment of officers to grades up to and including admiral. Staff corps officers, women officers, and reserve officers are not excluded from the operation of the provisions of the 1941 Act. Since authority exists for the appointment of officers of any category in any grade in the Navy, the existence of every grade in the several staff corps and in the Naval Reserve is recognized, and the restriction of these grades to the active list of the line is removed.</p>
<p class="note-body">The grade of Fleet Admiral is omitted inasmuch as the law authorizing appointments in this grade was limited.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;above the grade of chief warrant officer, W&ndash;4&rdquo; are inserted for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c) is added to make clear the fact that an officer serving in a position, such as chief of bureau, which entitles him to the rank, pay, and allowances of a rear admiral of the upper half ranks rear admirals receiving the pay and allowances of the lower half even though he has not been appointed to the grade of rear admiral or, if so appointed, is in the lower half. A statement of this fact is necessary to give full effect to 5 U.S.C. 441 which provides that chiefs of bureaus of the Navy Department and the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, while so serving, shall have &ldquo;corresponding rank and shall receive the same pay and allowances *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* as *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* chiefs of bureaus of the War Department and the Judge Advocate General of the Army&rdquo;. The rank so conferred, corresponding to the Army rank of major general, is rear admiral of the upper half. In &sect;&sect;5133 and 5148 of this title, based on 5 U.S.C. 441, the reference to the Army rank is eliminated and the corresponding Navy rank is substituted. The substitution is made because, as stated in the revision notes on those sections, the creation of the Department of the Air Force and the reorganization of the Department of the Army make it impracticable to continue to relate Navy Department positions to former War Department positions. This treatment of 5 U.S.C. 441 does not, however, completely cover the question of the rank, in relation to other officers in the Navy and other services, of a captain or rear admiral of the lower half who by virtue of his position becomes entitled to the rank, pay, and allowances of a rear admiral of the upper half. Under 34 U.S.C. 241a officers holding <em>commissions</em> in the grade of rear admiral rank with major generals if entitled to the pay of the upper half and with brigadier generals if entitled to the pay of the lower half. Under 5 U.S.C. 441 bureau chiefs and the Judge Advocate General rank with major generals regardless of the grade in which they hold commissions and, therefore, also rank all officers of the Navy who are ranked by major generals. This fact, obscured by the substitution of Navy rank in the codification of 5 U.S.C. 441, is set out in subsection (c).</p>

In duplicates, in part, &sect;&sect;555 and 597 of this title, which cover, respectively, the &ldquo;permanent regular warrant officer grades&rdquo; and the &ldquo;permanent reserve warrant officer grades&rdquo; in the armed forces. The concept that regular grades differ from reserve grades and that a grade held under a permanent appointment differs from the grade of the same name held under a temporary appointment is foreign to the naval service. In the Navy and the Marine Corps, all officers serving, for example, in the grade of chief warrant officer, W&ndash;4, are considered to be serving in the same grade regardless of whether they are Regulars or Reserves and regardless of whether they are temporary or permanent officers holding temporary or permanent appointments in that grade.

<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;rank&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;take precedence&rdquo; throughout the section for uniformity of expression.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the first sentence is broadened to include officers of the Marine Corps and officers not on a lineal list. Inclusion of the Marine Corps is possible because the sentence reflects the rule referred to by the Attorney General (25 Op. Atty. Gen. 517) as &ldquo;an unwritten law of the Army and Navy&rdquo; as to relative rank between officers in different services. Officers not on a lineal list may properly be included since the statement is consistent with the provisions for assigning lineal position to such officers when they become entitled to be placed on a list.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:1259 --><p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;the senior officer present afloat&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;the commanding officer of any fleet, squadron, or vessel acting singly&rdquo; to modernize the terminology. At the time of the enactment of the Revised Statutes the word &ldquo;squadron&rdquo; meant an organization of any number of vessels more than one, so that all cases were covered by R.S. 1422. The concept of &ldquo;senior officer present afloat&rdquo;, today, covers as nearly as possible the current equivalent of the concept in the original section. The words &ldquo;in foreign waters&rdquo; are inserted to conform to the interpretation of the Supreme Court in <em>Wilkes</em> v. <em>Dinsman</em>, 7 How. 89 (1849). The words &ldquo;on service&rdquo; are omitted, as they have no current ascertainable meaning. The words &ldquo;by Government or other transportation&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;in some public or other vessel&rdquo;, since this provision is interpreted as directing transportation by either ship or aircraft. The words &ldquo;to the United States&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;to an Atlantic or to a Pacific port of the United States, as their enlistment may have occurred on either the Atlantic or Pacific coast, of the United States&rdquo; because aircraft now land at inland airports as well as coastal airports and the duty to return an enlisted member to the United States under this provision is considered complete upon the member's arrival in the United States. The extensive transportation system in the United States presently obviates the necessity of returning a member to a particular area. Furthermore, under 37 U.S.C. 253, the Government bears the cost of transporting the discharged member to his home or to the place from which he was called to active duty. The words &ldquo;enlisted member of the naval service&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;all petty officers and persons of inferior ratings&rdquo; in accordance with present terminology. Members of the Marine Corps are included because of interpretations of the Comptroller General, in construing the language of the statute. (14 Comp. Gen. 807, 808, May 1, 1935.) The reference to persons enlisted without the limits of the United States is omitted as unnecessary, since return to the United States is optional with the member and the basic rule applies irrespective of place of enlistment. The language requiring that persons who are detained or sent home be subject to the laws and regulations for the Government of the Navy is omitted as unnecessary in view of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The provision referring to reentry to serve until the vessel returns to the United States is omitted because no law authorizes entry or reentry into the service for this restricted purpose.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the words &ldquo;an increase in basic pay of 25 percent&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;an addition of one-fourth of their former pay&rdquo; in conformity with the Career Compensation Act of 1949. 34 U.S.C. 201b permanently suspended the detention pay increase in time of war and this effect is expressed in subsection (b)(2) by the words &ldquo;except in time of war&rdquo;. 34 U.S.C. 201a, declaring that the pay addition authorized by this section does not apply to enlistments extended under other provisions of law, is omitted as unnecessary, since the increased pay provision is specifically limited to detentions under this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c) the term &ldquo;enlistment contract&rdquo; is substituted for the term &ldquo;shipping-articles&rdquo; to conform to present terminology.</p>

<p class="note-body">Since appointments under this section are either made, or not made, in the discretion of the President, the proviso of 34 U.S.C. 3d, authorizing the President to suspend the operation of this section with respect to lieutenants (junior grade) and lieutenants in the Navy and first lieutenants and captains in the Marine Corps, is omitted from subsection (a) as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (b) and (c) the words &ldquo;and above&rdquo; have been executed by naming the grades they imply, to wit, chief petty officers and master and technical sergeants. In the statement of the grades to which appointments may be made, the words &ldquo;including the grades of warrant officer and commissioned warrant officer&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. In the list of persons who may be appointed, reference to commissioned warrant officers is omitted because they are included within the term &ldquo;warrant officers&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f) the words &ldquo;do not change the *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* status&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;appointments *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* shall not be vacated.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;advancement&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;in accordance with laws relating to the Regular Navy or Marine Corps&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;privileges and gratuities&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The first proviso is omitted as unnecessary in view of the Career Compensation Act of 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (g)(2) that portion of 34 U.S.C. 3c(a) which excludes officers on the retired list from the definition of the word &ldquo;officers&rdquo; is treated as precluding the appointment of such officers under this section. There is no express statement of law making retired enlisted members ineligible for such appointments; however, the context indicates this to be the intent of Congress. In subsection (g)(3) that portion of 34 U.S.C. 3c(a) which excludes officers on active duty for training from the definition of the word &ldquo;officers&rdquo; is treated as precluding the appointment of persons on training duty under this section. While there is no statement of law making enlisted members of the Naval Reserve and the Marine Corps Reserve on active duty for training ineligible for appointments under this section, the context indicates this to be the intent of Congress and clause (3) is thus written. The exception as to the Fleet Reserve is omitted as unnecessary inasmuch as, pursuant to the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952, the Fleet Reserve is no longer a part of the Naval Reserve but is a separate and distinct component of the Navy.</p>

<p class="note-body">The provision of &sect;7 of the Act of March 3, 1899 (supra), relating to relative rank is omitted as executed. The provision that the rank conferred upon staff corps officers shall not change their titles is omitted because these titles were abolished by &sect;405 of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 (34 U.S.C. 10a) and the corresponding line grades substituted. The cited proviso in the Act of June 24, 1910 (34 U.S.C. 253 (proviso)) is omitted as obsolete because the officers referred to were officers of the Construction Corps which has been abolished.</p>
<p class="note-body">The first sentence of this section is phrased so as to reflect the accepted meaning of the cited provision. 34 U.S.C. 253, as worded, if interpreted literally, could be held to prohibit, for example, the assignment of members of the Medical Service Corps, Nurse Corps, and Hospital Corps to duty under officers of the Medical Corps, despite the fact that all of these corps were established by law within the Medical Department of the Navy. The provision is not so interpreted. It is understood to restrict only the types of activities that staff corps officers may command, and not to restrict to a single corps the personnel who may be assigned to an activity commanded by a staff corps officer.</p>

That section established a basic allowance for subsistence for enlisted members entitled to basic pay who are not subsisting at Government expense and prescribes the conditions under which the basic allowance for subsistence shall be paid and the amount of the allowance. Pursuant to Executive Order No. 10119, March 30, 1950, 15 F.R. 1757, the Secretary of Defense is authorized to make supplemental regulations to carry out the provisions of &sect;301.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;active duty&rdquo; before the words &ldquo;enlisted personnel&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage since there is no authority to hospitalize an enlisted member in a naval hospital under conditions where he would not be entitled to a hospital ration. The words &ldquo;active and inactive&rdquo; before the words &ldquo;retired enlisted personnel&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The word &ldquo;members&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;personnel&rdquo; for uniformity.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;members of the naval service&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;naval patients on the active or retired list and members of the Naval Reserve or Marine Corps Reserve&rdquo;. The definition of &ldquo;member of the naval service&rdquo; makes the terms coextensive. Reference to St. Elizabeths Hospital is omitted in view of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1946, &sect;201, 60 Stat. 1098, which transferred the functions of that hospital pertaining to members of the naval service to the Secretary of the Navy. For the purposes of this section, St. Elizabeths is now in the same category as other United States hospitals.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) reference to R.S. 4813 (24 U.S.C. 6) is omitted because the Administrator of Veterans&rsquo; Affairs held in Decision Number 571 (July 27, 1944) that R.S. 4813 was repealed by implication. Since this decision is binding on the Secretary of the Navy (see 38 U.S.C. 11a&ndash;2), the deductions from pension accounts authorized by R.S. 4813 may not be made.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c) the words &ldquo;each retired enlisted member of the naval service&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;retired enlisted men&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;is entitled to&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;shall receive&rdquo; to conform to terminology used throughout this title. The words &ldquo;equal in value to the hospital ration&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;prescribed by law for enlisted men of the Regular Navy&rdquo; to show that the amount of the allowance is the value of the hospital ration. The words &ldquo;for each day&rdquo; are inserted to make it clear that the ration allowance is credited on a daily basis. The words &ldquo;under this section&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;in a Federal hospital in accordance with law&rdquo; because this section is the only authority for the hospitalization of members of the Fleet Reserve and Fleet Marine Corps Reserve and retired enlisted members of the naval service in Federal hospitals, other than naval hospitals, under conditions entitling the members to a ration allowance. The subsistence of a member of the Fleet Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve or a retired enlisted member of the naval service while hospitalized in naval hospitals is covered by &sect;6086 of this title.</p>

Specific appropriation titles vary from one appropriation act to the next. The permanent authority contained in 34 U.S.C. 359 for the Secretary of the Navy to use appropriations available for the pay of the Navy and the Marine Corps is not affected by a change in the titles of those appropriations nor is it affected by a specific authorization in an appropriation act to use, during the life of the act, a different type of appropriation.</p>

<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;member&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;naval service&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;Navy, Marine Corps, and the Reserve components thereof&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;form of&rdquo; are added for clarity. Reference to the date &ldquo;September 24, 1945&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;is entitled to&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;shall be furnished&rdquo; for uniformity. The decision of the Comptroller General of December 23, 1949 (B&ndash;91297), has not been overlooked. That decision, without passing on a case in which the point was involved, indicated that the transportation entitlement in 34 U.S.C. 900a might be impliedly repealed by the Career Compensation Act of 1949. The editors of the United States Code Annotated, apparently on the basis of this decision, have omitted 34 U.S.C.A. 900a from the 1954 pocket part. A conclusion that the section is repealed, however, defeats the specific purpose of the provision, which, as indicated in the legislative hearings, was to insure that underage dischargees would be transported home and not simply released at the place of discharge.</p>

<p class="note-body">The Act of April 14, 1949 (34 U.S.C. 410b&ndash;1), extending the benefits of 34 U.S.C. 410b to officers on the honorary retired lists, was enacted because the Comptroller General had held that these officers, being already in a retired status, could not be retired under 34 U.S.C. 410b (U.S. Code Congressional Service, 1949, p. 1179). The provisions of the Naval Reserve Act of 1938 relating to the honorary retired lists were repealed by &sect;803 of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952, but insofar as they provided for retirement and retired pay they were reenacted, for a period of 20 years, in &sect;413 of that act (50 U.S.C. 1052). Persons on the honorary retired lists when the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 was passed were transferred to the appropriate Retired Reserve under &sect;213 of the Act. Persons qualifying for retirement under &sect;413 are likewise placed in the Retired Reserve. The purpose of Congress in enacting &sect;413 was to preserve the accrued rights of persons who were members of reserve components on January 1, 1953, the effective date <!-- PDFPage:1296 -->of the Act (U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News, 1952, p. 3584). One of their rights was the right to apply for retirement under 34 U.S.C. 410b upon completion of the required service, notwithstanding the fact that, before qualifying for retirement under that section, they had already acquired a retired status. Subsection (c) is worded accordingly.</p>

<p class="note-body">Title III of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 authorizes temporary promotions to the grades of lieutenant through rear admiral. The purpose of &sect;316(j) of that act (34 U.S.C. 410m) was to insure that each officer who is temporarily promoted under that Title, and who retires before he receives a permanent appointment in the grade in which he is serving, will be considered, for the purposes of the laws relating to retired grade and pay, to be serving in the grade he holds pursuant to his temporary appointment. Since &sect;5001 of this title provides that an officer who holds a permanent appointment in one grade and a temporary appointment in a higher grade is considered as serving in the higher grade, a restatement of the substance of &sect;316(j) is unnecessary and is omitted from subsection (a). The words &ldquo;retired other than by reason of physical disability incurred in line of duty&rdquo;, in 34 U.S.C. 43g(d) and (f) and 34 U.S.C. 410r(g), are omitted as unnecessary, since this section relates only to officers who are voluntarily retired under this chapter. The words &ldquo;basic pay to which he would be entitled if serving on active duty in the grade in which retired&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;active-duty pay with longevity credit of the rank with which <!-- PDFPage:1298 -->retired&rdquo; in 34 U.S.C. 410c(a), for the words &ldquo;active-duty pay to which entitled at the time of retirement&rdquo; in 34 U.S.C. 43g(d), and for the words &ldquo;active-duty pay to which she would be entitled if serving, at the time of retirement, on active duty in the rank in which placed upon the retired list&rdquo; in 34 U.S.C. 43g(f) and 34 U.S.C. 410r(g), to make clear the fact that the amount of retired pay is not permanently fixed at the time of retirement but is subject to change when rates of basic pay are changed, as provided in 34 U.S.C. 410q. The words &ldquo;basic pay&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;active-duty pay&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;creditable for basic pay&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;for which entitled to credit in the computation of her active-duty pay&rdquo;, and for the words &ldquo;for which entitled to credit in the computation of their pay while on active duty&rdquo; to conform to the terminology used in the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Unlike provisions of law authorizing retirement on various other grounds, R.S. 1443, which provides for the retirement of officers on their own application after 40 years of service, contains no provisions as to retired pay. R.S. 1588 provided, inter alia, that officers so retired should received retired pay at the rate of 75 percent of the sea pay of their respective grades, but that section was expressly repealed by &sect;531(a)(7) of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, leaving no specific provision for the retired pay of officers retired under R.S. 1443. It would be absurd to assume, however, that Congress intended that an officer having 40 years of service should be retired without pay, when he could have been retired with pay at any time within the preceding 20 years. By the repeal of R.S. 1588 Congress intended merely to remove obsolete and superseded provisions as to retirement at age 62 and retirement after 45 years of service, references to sea pay, and provisions, inconsistent with later law, for half pay for officers retired for other reasons. Congress intended the retired pay of officers retired after 40 years of service to be computed according to the formula prescribed generally for retired officers, other than for officers retired by reason of physical disability, and this section is worded accordingly.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is added for clarity. With respect to officers appointed under &sect;&sect;5231 or 5232 of this title it represents a necessary inference from 34 U.S.C. 410<em>o</em> and 623b(e), codified in &sect;5233 of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the word &ldquo;Regular&rdquo; is inserted before the words &ldquo;Navy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Marine Corps&rdquo; to reflect the longstanding interpretation that 34 U.S.C. 431 applies only to members of the Regular Navy and Regular Marine Corps. So much of the Act of March 2, 1907, ch. 2515, &sect;1 (34 U.S.C. 431), as pertains to allowances and rations was expressly repealed by the Act of June 16, 1942, ch. 413, 56 Stat. 369. The words &ldquo;active service in the armed forces&rdquo; are substituted for 34 U.S.C. 432 for brevity. The reference to the former Revenue Cutter Service in 34 U.S.C. 432 is omitted as obsolete, inasmuch as that Service was absorbed by the Coast Guard in 1915. If there are any enlisted men not yet retired who served in the Revenue Cutter Service, their right to count that service for the purpose of this section is protected by the saving provisions accompanying this title. The reference to active service in the Civil or Spanish-American War in 34 U.S.C. 432 is omitted as obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is inserted to cover into the section permanent enlisted members who are temporarily appointed to commissioned or warrant grades.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsection (d) is substituted for 34 U.S.C. 350i(e) as that section pertains to voluntary retirement of enlisted members with 30 years of active service.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the word &ldquo;Federal&rdquo; is omitted and the words &ldquo;in the armed forces, other than active duty for training&rdquo; are inserted. The words &ldquo;active Federal service&rdquo; are not defined in 50 U.S.C. 1052. Section 310 of the Naval Reserve Act of 1938, which 50 U.S.C. 1052 replaced, specifies active service in the &ldquo;Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Naval Auxiliary Service, Naval Reserve Force, Naval Militia in Federal status, National Naval Volunteers, Naval Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve Force, and Marine Corps Reserve.&rdquo; 50 U.S.C. 1052 was intended to preserve the rights of persons who, on January 1, 1953, were members of reserve components, so that they would not be prejudiced by the repeal of &sect;310 of the Naval Reserve Act of 1938 (U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News, 1952, p. 3584). To effect that purpose, the service that was creditable under the 1938 Act must be creditable under 50 U.S.C. 1052. The words &ldquo;active service in the armed forces, other than active duty for training&rdquo; cover all creditable service. The Judge Advocate General of the Navy, in an opinion dated August 27, 1954 (JAG II:2:WGA:CA:mk), held that active duty for training was not creditable under the 1938 Act and is, therefore, not creditable under the 1952 Act.</p>

These words merely illustrate the class of persons transferred to the Fleet Reserve under the Naval Reserve Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1178, as referred to in the section from which these words were taken, and in no way limit that class or impose a citizenship requirement for membership in it.

<!-- PDFPage:1302 --><p class="note-body">In subsection (b) reference to the date July 1, 1925, is omitted, since members who were in the naval service on or before that date may, if they are qualified and so elect, be transferred to the Fleet Reserve or to the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve under 34 U.S.C. 854c instead of under 34 U.S.C. 854b, as provided in the fifth proviso of 34 U.S.C. 854c. That proviso and the provisions of 34 U.S.C. 854b, which are applicable only to persons who were in the naval service in 1925, are not codified because they relate to a small closed class and are therefore of limited interest. They are not repealed, however. (See Table 2D.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (b) and (c) the term &ldquo;active service in the armed forces&rdquo; is substituted for the term &ldquo;active Federal service&rdquo; to execute the definition in the last sentence of 34 U.S.C. 854c.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c) the words &ldquo;is entitled, when not on active duty, to retainer pay at the rate of 21/2 percent of the basic pay that he received at the time of transfer&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;except when on active duty, shall be paid at the annual rate of 21/2 per centum of the annual base and longevity pay they are receiving at the time of transfer&rdquo; to conform to the terminology of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) An officer who is to be eliminated from an active status under subsection (a) shall, if qualified, be given an opportunity to request transfer to the appropriate Retired Reserve and, if he requests it, shall be so transferred. If he is not so transferred, he shall, in the discretion of the Secretary, be transferred to the appropriate inactive status list or be discharged from the Naval Reserve or the Marine Corps Reserve.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Secretary may defer the retirement or discharge under this subsection of an officer serving in the permanent grade of lieutenant commander or commander in the Naval Reserve or in the permanent grade of major or lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps Reserve for a period of time which does not exceed the amount of service in an active status which was credited to the officer at the time of his original appointment or thereafter under any provision of law, if the officer can complete at least 20 years of service as computed under section 12732 of this title during the period of such deferment.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;who is considered as having twice failed of selection for promotion&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;after failing of selection for promotion *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* a second time&rdquo; to conform to similar statements in this title. (See the revision note on section 5776.) The words &ldquo;may be retained in&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage, since the authority to eliminate such officers from an active status is discretionary with the Secretary.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (e) is added to avoid conflict with 50:1311(d) and (e), codified in sections 6397 and 6403 of this title. 50:1311(d) and (e) contain special provisions for &ldquo;women officers&rdquo; and officers in the Nurse Corps, respectively, so that officers in these categories must be excepted from this section. Women officers appointed under the act of June 24, 1952, ch. 457 (66 Stat. 155; 34 U.S.C. 21e) (codified in section 5581 of this title), are not &ldquo;women officers&rdquo; within the meaning of 50:1311(d), however, but are required to be promoted, retired, or eliminated from active status as if they were men. (See the revision note on section 5665 of this title.) The application of this section to these officers is therefore made explicit.</p>
<p class="note-body">Both men and women are eligible for appointment as reserve officers in the Nurse Corps and are subject to the special provisions relating to that corps.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) states the general rule that a retired officer, when recalled to active duty, shall be recalled in the grade he holds on the retired list. The rule is derived, not from a specific provision of law, but from the fact that special legislative authority is required to recall a retired officer in any other grade.</p>
<p class="note-body">The desirability of including a positive statement of the rule is pointed up by the legislative history of the Act of February 21, 1946, ch. 34, &sect;8(a), 60 Stat. 28, amending the Act of July 24, 1941, ch. 320, &sect;10(d), 55 Stat. 605 (34 U.S.C. 350i(d)). The 1946 amendment states the rule, but only as to a limited class of retired personnel, namely persons temporarily appointed or promoted under the 1941 Act while on the retired list. The amendment provided that such persons, when released to inactive duty, should be given the highest grade in which they had served satisfactorily and, if subsequently recalled to active duty, should be recalled in the grade so accorded them. The legislative history shows that the bill (S. 1405, 79th Cong., 1st sess.), originally was written so as to provide that retired personnel should be recalled in their prior permanent grades or ratings instead of in the higher grades accorded them on the retired list while on inactive duty. When a member of the Naval Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives suggested an amendment to allow retired personnel to be recalled in the higher grades, the Navy spokesman pointed out that no law was required to permit this; in fact, retired personnel would be <em>required</em> to be recalled in the grades they hold on the retired list in the absence of any law to the contrary. Thus the result desired by the committee member could be achieved, simply by deleting the provision instead of amending it. After some discussion, however, it was decided to adopt the suggested amendment in order not to &ldquo;leave things to inference&rdquo; (H. Rept. No. 158, December 6, 1945, pp. 2290&ndash;2292).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 412(a) of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 (34 U.S.C. 410n) (codified, except for the first proviso, in &sect;6150 of this title), supplies a further reason why a positive statement of the rule is desirable. That section provides that an officer who has been specially commended for the performance of duty in actual combat shall, when retired, be placed on the retired list in the grade next higher than that in which serving at the time of retirement. The first proviso, codified in subsection (b) of this section, provided further that an officer advanced under &sect;412(a) to a flag or general officer grade could be recalled either in the advanced grade or in the grade from which advanced. The law was silent as to the grade in which other officers advanced under &sect;412(a) should be recalled. It was understood that they would be recalled in the advanced grade accorded them on the retired list, because there was no authority to recall them in any other grade. However, the Comptroller General raised a question as to their right to the pay of the higher grade when recalled. Although the final decision of the Comptroller General was in favor of the higher pay (30 Comp. Gen. 242, December 20, 1950), the fact that the question was raised indicates the confusion that results from leaving the rule to inference.</p>
<p class="note-body">It appears that the rule was never in doubt until after the enactment of the two recent laws cited above, one applying the rule to a limited class, and one stating a discretionary exception without stating the rule itself. These two laws make it more difficult than it was formerly to derive the correct conclusion by inference alone.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the words before the first proviso are omitted as executed. The words &ldquo;after June 13, 1949&rdquo; in the first proviso, relating to a declaration of emergency by Congress, are omitted as executed. The emergencies existing on June 13, 1949, have expired, as indicated in the Act of July 3, 1952, ch. 570, 66 Stat. 333. The word &ldquo;Regular&rdquo; is inserted before &ldquo;Navy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Marine Corps&rdquo; to preserve the meaning of this provision which distinguishes members of the reserve components from members of the Navy and the Marine Corps.

<p class="note-body">This section is included in this chapter without specific reference to statutory source to resolve the ambiguities and conflicts existing in the statutes relating to the appointment of midshipmen at the Naval Academy. The word &ldquo;appoint&rdquo; has been used in various statutes when the intent of Congress was to provide authority in the persons named to &ldquo;choose,&rdquo; &ldquo;select,&rdquo; or &ldquo;nominate&rdquo; for the office of midshipman. These statutes have been collected and codified in &sect;6954 of this title, which reflects the various sources of nominees for &ldquo;appointment&rdquo; as midshipmen and the persons who may so &ldquo;nominate&rdquo; them. The actual appointing power resides in the President and this implied authority is herein expressed for clarity and for the purpose of uniformity of expression.</p>

<p class="note-body">All provisions of law authorizing appointments to the Naval Academy from various sources are collected in this section. The language is extensively changed to meet the needs of this organization of the source material.

The manner of appointing the selectees and nominees, in all cases, is covered in &sect;6953 of this title. In the case of nominees from States, the District of Columbia, Territories, and from Puerto Rico, the qualification that the nominees must be from the political subdivisions from which nominated is indicated. The requirement that the nominees be actual residents of the political subdivisions is contained in &sect;6958(b) of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1) the qualification that appointees must be from the sons of members of the various &ldquo;regular&rdquo; components of the armed forces is added, as &ldquo;Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard&rdquo; are so interpreted in this statute.</p>

Members who were then under the civil-service retirement system were required to choose whether they would remain under it or would participate in the system established by the 1936 Act. They could not come under both. The section also authorized the Secretary of the Navy to supplement the retired income of members who elected to come under the 1936 Act and whose age in 1936 was such that they could not purchase adequate annuities before retiring.

<p class="note-body">In two instances, the source law to be codified by the bill includes provisions that on their face require that the Department of Defense notify Congress of certain actions. These notification requirements were terminated by section 602 of the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 (Public Law 99&ndash;433), which terminated all recurring reporting requirements applicable to the Department of Defense except for those requirements that were specifically exempted in that section. The source law sections are sections 8009(c) and 8005(j) (proviso) of the FY86 defense appropriations Act (Public Law 99&ndash;190), enacted December 19, 1985, which would be codified as section 2201 of title 10 (by section 1(d) of the bill) and section 7313(a) of title 10 (by section 1(n) of the bill). In codifying the authorities provided the Department of Defense by these two provisions of law, the committee believes that it is appropriate to reinstate the congressional notification requirements that go with those authorities. These sections were recurring annual appropriation provisions for many years and were made permanent only months before the enactment of the 1986 Reorganization Act. It is the committee's belief that the failure to exempt these provisions from the general reports termination provision was inadvertent and notes that the notification provisions had in fact previously applied to the Department of Defense for many years. The action of the committee restores the status quo as it existed before the Reorganization Act.</p>

<p class="note-body">The source law provided that leases of lands of the United States within the naval petroleum reserves in existence before July 1, 1936, except leases that had become part of an approved unit or cooperative plan and agreement, should terminate at the end of their initial 20-year period, and that the lands covered by these leases could then be re-leased by the Secretary of the Navy. All of the leases covered by this provision have terminated as provided therein. Thus the provision for the termination of the leases is executed and the only remaining effect of the source is to authorize the re-lease of the lands formerly covered by the terminated leases. This section is worded accordingly. Reference to the classes of leases that were excepted from the termination is omitted as unnecessary because these leases were, of course, not terminated. They are not affected, since this section refers only to leases that were &ldquo;terminated by law&rdquo;.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In administering the naval petroleum reserves under this chapter, the Secretary shall use, store, or sell the petroleum produced from the naval petroleum reserves and lands covered by joint, unit, or other cooperative plans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Subject to paragraph (2) and notwithstanding any other provision of law, each sale of the United States share of petroleum shall be made by the Secretary at public sale to the highest qualified bidder, at such time, in such amounts, and after such advertising as the Secretary considers proper and without regard to Federal, State, or local regulations controlling sales or allocation of petroleum products. Each sale of the United States share of petroleum shall be for periods of not more than one year, except that a sale of natural gas may be made for a period of more than one year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not sell any part of the United States share of petroleum produced from Naval Petroleum Reserves Numbered 1, 2, and 3 at a price less than the higher of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 90 percent of the current sales price, as estimated by the Secretary, of comparable petroleum in the same area; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the price of petroleum being purchased for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, minus the cost of transporting petroleum from the naval petroleum reserve concerned to the nearest storage area of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, with adjustments for the difference in the quality of the petroleum being purchased for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and petroleum being produced from the naval petroleum reserve concerned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of paragraph (2), the term &ldquo;petroleum&rdquo; does not include natural gas liquids.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In no event shall the Secretary permit the award of any contract which would result in any person obtaining control, directly or indirectly, over more than 20 percent of the estimated annual United States share of petroleum produced from Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Each proposal for sale under this title shall provide that the terms of every sale of the United States share of petroleum from the naval petroleum reserves shall be so structured as to give full and equal opportunity for the acquisition of petroleum by all interested persons, including major and independent oil producers and refiners alike. When the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, determines that the public interests will be served by the sale of petroleum to small refiners not having their own adequate sources of supply of petroleum, the Secretary is authorized and directed to set aside a portion of the United States share of petroleum produced for sale to such refiners under the provisions of this section <!-- PDFPage:1370 -->for processing or use in such refineries, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) none of the production sold to small refiners may be resold in kind;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) production must be sold at a cost of not less than the prevailing local market price of comparable petroleum;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the set-aside portion may not exceed 25 percent of the estimated annual United States share of the total production from all producing naval petroleum reserves; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b), the Secretary may, at his discretion if he deems it to be in the public interest, prorate such petroleum among such refiners for sale, without competition, at not less than the prevailing local market price of comparable petroleum.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Any petroleum produced from the naval petroleum reserves, except such petroleum which is either exchanged in similar quantities for convenience or increased efficiency or transportation with persons or the government of an adjacent foreign state, or which is temporarily exported for convenience or increased efficiency of transportation across parts of an adjacent foreign state and reenters the United States, shall be subject to all of the limitations and licensing requirements of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.) and, in addition, before any petroleum subject to this section may be exported under the limitations and licensing requirement and penalty and enforcement provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979, the President must make and publish an express finding that such exports will not diminish the total quality or quantity of petroleum available to the United States and that such exports are in the national interest and are in accord with the Export Administration Act of 1979.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) During the period of production or any extension thereof authorized by section 7422(c) of this title, the consultation and approval requirements of section 7431(a)(3) of this title are waived.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Prior to the promulgation of any rules and regulations, plans of development and amendments thereto, and in the entering and making of contracts and operating agreements relating to the development, production, or sale of petroleum in or from the reserves, the Secretary shall consult with and give due consideration to the views of the Attorney General of the United States with respect to matters which may affect competition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No contract or operating agreement may be made, issued, or executed under this chapter until at least 15 days after the Secretary notifies the Attorney General of the proposed contract or operating agreement. Such notification shall contain such information as the Attorney General may require in order to advise the Secretary as to whether such contract or operating agreement may create or maintain a situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws. If, within such 15-day period, the Attorney General advises the Secretary that a contract or operating agreement may create or maintain a situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws, then the Secretary may not make, issue, or execute that contract or operating agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to confer on any person immunity from civil or criminal liability, or to create defenses to actions, under the antitrust laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) In this section, the term &ldquo;antitrust laws&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) sections 73 and 74 of the Wilson Tariff Act (15 U.S.C. 8 and 9); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Act of June 19, 1936 (commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Robinson-Patman Act&rdquo;) (15 U.S.C. 13a, 13b, and 21a).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Any pipeline which accepts, conveys, or transports any petroleum produced from Naval Petroleum Reserves Numbered 1 or Numbered 3 shall accept, convey, and transport without discrimination and at reasonable rates any such petroleum as a common carrier insofar as petroleum from such reserves is concerned.

The second proviso, forbidding consideration of claims for more than $3,000 if they accrued before Sept. 8, 1939, is omitted as obsolete. It was designed to avoid reviving stale claims upon enactment of the source law on July 3, 1944. However, as a matter of practice, no claims are settled under this authority which are more than two years old, in line with the two-year statute of limitations contained in the Suits in Admiralty Act and the Public Vessels Act. This limitation has been officially publicized in the Federal Register for May 22, 1947, p. 3296, and in 32 C.F.R. 752. The third proviso in 46 U.S.C. 797 is omitted as unnecessary, since the appropriation named therein no longer exists, and the payments are now made from appropriations for the Department of Defense.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) the words &ldquo;including aircraft&rdquo; are omitted as covered by subsection (b). The section is written to make the words &ldquo;during war&rdquo; applicable to the entire chapter. These words appear in 34 U.S.C. 1159, but not in 34 U.S.C. 1131. Prize is historically and uniformly treated as a war-time matter, so no substantive change results from the extension. The words &ldquo;this chapter does not affect&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;nothing herein contained shall be construed as affecting, or in any way impairing&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;Air Force&rdquo; are added under authority of &sect;305(a) of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (5 U.S.C. 171<em>l</em>), to provide the same applicability as formerly provided by the word &ldquo;Army&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;legal&rdquo; is omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the definition of the term &ldquo;ship&rdquo; is omitted as covered by the term &ldquo;vessel&rdquo;. All of 34 U.S.C. 1132 except that part which includes &ldquo;aircraft&rdquo; within the term &ldquo;vessels&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary since the defined term &ldquo;vessels of the Navy&rdquo; does not appear in the provisions to which the definition is made applicable. The last sentence of 34 U.S.C. 1158 applies only to Title LIV (Prize) of the Revised Statutes. In subsection (d) it is broadened to cover the entire body of statutory prize law. Additions to the prize law made by the Act of August 18, 1942, ch. 553, 56 Stat. 746, as amended, operated only to extend the jurisdiction of courts of the United States to certain cases in which the prizes are not brought into the territorial waters of the United States. Relations of this country with other countries are not affected by the 1942 Act except when jurisdiction is exercised by American courts over prizes brought into cobelligerent ports. As that Act provides that the consent of the cobelligerent is necessary to the exercise of such jurisdiction, the rule against contravention of treaties is properly applied to it.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) reflects 28 U.S.C. 1333 by restating the basic prize jurisdiction of that section over prizes brought into the United States, and by providing that the extension of prize jurisdiction conferred by 34 U.S.C. 1159 on the United States district courts is exclusive of the courts of the States. 34 U.S.C. 1166 and the second sentence of 34 U.S.C. 1164 are executed in the single jurisdictional statement of this section and the consolidation of the Act of August 18, 1942, ch. 553, 56 Stat. 746 (34 U.S.C. 1159&ndash;1166) with the earlier prize provisions. The words &ldquo;during war&rdquo; in 34 U.S.C. 1159 are omitted as covered in &sect;7651 of this title. In clause (1) the words &ldquo;or the Territories, Commonwealths, or possessions&rdquo; are added, since &ldquo;United States&rdquo; in this title is geographically limited to the 48 States and the District of Columbia, whereas the term here is intended to include all places within the jurisdiction of the district courts.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (4) the words &ldquo;taken or&rdquo; preceding the words &ldquo;appropriated for the use of the United States&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage and in order to avoid confusion between the two meanings of the word &ldquo;taken&rdquo; in prize law. In both the Revised Statutes and the 1942 Act the phrase &ldquo;taken or appropriated&rdquo; means no more than &ldquo;appropriated&rdquo; alone, whereas &ldquo;taken&rdquo;, in the phrase &ldquo;taken as prize&rdquo; means &ldquo;captured&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is included to make the statement of jurisdiction complete. It is derived by implication from the first sentence of R.S. 4625 (34 U.S.C. 1141) which is the source of subsection (c) of &sect;7653 of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is inserted in order to present a complete statement of the subject matter of the section. Its substance is not specifically set out in the Revised Statutes but is strongly implied in 34 U.S.C. 1135 which requires the United States attorney for the district in which the port is located to file a libel.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the requisites for jurisdiction conferred under the 1942 Act are substituted for the words &ldquo;brought under the jurisdiction conferred by this Act&rdquo;. The substituted words are the same as those used in clauses (2), (3), and (4) of the preceding section except that the words &ldquo;before proceedings are started&rdquo; are added following the words &ldquo;appropriated for the use of the United States&rdquo; for clarity. An appropriation can take place before or after proceedings are commenced, but in the latter case there is no occasion for the Attorney General to determine venue.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c) the words &ldquo;or if because the whole has been appropriated to the use of the United States&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;or the value of anything taken or appropriated for the use of the United States&rdquo; are omitted. The provision in the 1942 Act which empowers the Attorney General to decide the venue of proceedings when the prize property has been appropriated is incompatible with the provision in R.S. 4625 which authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to select the judicial district in such cases. Hence the 1942 Act superseded R.S. 4625 with respect to cases of this type. Deposit of the value of prize property appropriated by the United States is adequately covered in &sect;7663 of this title and is not mentioned here. The second sentence of 34 U.S.C. 1141 (R.S. 4625), relating to proceedings by captors, is omitted because it was rendered inoperative by the Act of March 3, 1899, ch. 413, &sect;13, 30 Stat. 1007, which repealed all laws authorizing the distribution of prize money to captors.</p>

<p class="note-body">The first sentence of subsection (a) is reworded to make it clear that the limitation as to number applies <!-- PDFPage:1393 -->to the number of prize commissioners who may serve in each judicial district at any one time and that the court is not precluded from making additional appointments to fill vacancies. The words &ldquo;for service in connection with any prize cause in which proceedings are brought under section 7653(a) or (c) of this title&rdquo; are added to distinguish the prize commissioners from the special prize commissioners mentioned in subsection (b). The words &ldquo;officer of the Navy&rdquo; in subsections (a) and (b) are substituted for the words &ldquo;naval officer, active or retired&rdquo; because an officer of the Navy does not lose his status as such upon retirement, and to retain these words would open to question the many other provisions in this subtitle treating retired officers as officers.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b) the words &ldquo;in connection with any prize cause in which proceedings are brought under section 7653(b) of this title&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;in cases arising under this Act&rdquo; for accuracy of reference. The words &ldquo;including the duties prescribed by this chapter for United States marshals&rdquo; are added for clarity. Section 7662 of this title prescribes the duties of marshals. Most of these duties could not be performed by the marshals if the prize was not brought into a United States port. In such cases occurring during World War II the courts, under the authority of the 1942 Act, required the special prize commissioners to perform the duties ordinarily performed by the marshals. The words &ldquo;without regard for the requirements of section 7367 of this title&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary, since that section is codified in subsection (a), and language distinguishing the prize commissioners from the special prize commissions is included in each subsection.</p>

Under the Revised Statutes it was implied and understood that the Navy could appropriate prizes on behalf of the United States for use by the Navy. Use by other government agencies was not contemplated. The 1942 Act enabled the Navy to turn prize vessels over to the War Shipping Administration without bringing them back to United States ports. Reference to that Administration in subsection (a) is omitted since the Administration has been abolished and these functions have not been specifically vested in its successors. It is surplusage as well, because the authority to appropriate is given to any officer or agency designated by the President.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proviso added to R.S. 4624 (34 U.S.C. 1140) by the 1945 amendment is identical with the proviso added to the 1942 Act (34 U.S.C. 1162) by the 1944 amendment. The 1945 Act completed the process of making the procedure under the Revised Statutes the same as that in effect for causes over which the courts were given jurisdiction by the World War II legislation, and its single statement in subsection (c) is therefore justified.</p>
<p class="note-body">34 U.S.C. 1140 and the revised section reflect the Act of March 3, 1899, ch. 413, &sect;13, 30 Stat. 1007, which repealed laws authorizing distribution of prize proceeds to captors, and the Act of May 29, 1920, ch. 214, 41 Stat. 654, which requires substitution of &ldquo;Treasurer of the United States or public depositary&rdquo; for &ldquo;assistant treasurer&rdquo;.</p>

While this is apparently inconsistent with R.S. 4652 as originally enacted, it is consistent with the intent expressed by Congress in the provision of the Act of March 3, 1899 (supra), which repealed provisions relating to the distribution of prize money and bounty to crews. This act, it is true, did not mention salvage; and salvage money is still occasionally awarded to crews of naval vessels. However, such occasions are rare, and it is the general policy of the Department of the Navy not to claim salvage on behalf of its personnel. No case appears in which salvage derived from prize has been claimed for such personnel. Prize salvage is more closely related to prize money than it is to other salvage. The determination by Congress that captors should not share in the proceeds of prizes is, therefore, as in 34 U.S.C. 1158, carried through the revised section to salvage derived from prize. The word &ldquo;amounts&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;the whole amount&rdquo;.</p>
