<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), all references to the appointment of assistant chiefs are omitted as covered by sections 3037 and 3040 of this title. All references to the grade of brigadier general are omitted, since 10:21f(b) specifies the grade of major general for the offices. 10:559g(a) (4th sentence) is omitted as surplusage, since the appointment is to a permanent grade. 10:559g(a) (6th and 7th sentences) is omitted as executed. 10:559g(a) (last sentence) is omitted, since the revised section applies only to the officers named in subsection (a). The words &ldquo;except the Judge Advocate General&rdquo; are inserted for clarity. The eight words before clause (1), and clauses (1) and (2), are substituted for the words &ldquo;as prescribed in section 559g of this title&rdquo;, in 10:21f(b), and 10:559g(a) (1st sentence).

<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the introductory clause is substituted for 10:559g(b) (words before colon of 1st sentence). The words &ldquo;in a grade above major general&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;of a rank above that of the position for which selections are to be made&rdquo;, since all the positions are in the grade of major general. The word &ldquo;select&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;appoint&rdquo;, since the filling of the offices is not appointment to an office in the constitutional sense. The word &ldquo;extensive&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;extended&rdquo;, except where it refers to &ldquo;extended&rdquo; active duty, in which case the word &ldquo;extended&rdquo; is omitted as surplusage.

<p class="note-body">After the enactment of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, section 308 of the Army Organization Act of 1950 (10:61&ndash;1) provided for an Assistant Judge Advocate General and three brigadier generals in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the Army. The creation of these four general officer spaces served to increase the mentioned authorized strength figure from 357 to 361, and the figure 201 to 205. The opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1948/5806, 2 Sept. 1948) is in accord with that conclusion.</p>
<p class="note-body">The revised section reflects the authorized strength of the Regular Army in general officers on the active list resulting from the mentioned allocation to the Air Force and the addition of four general officer spaces in the Judge Advocate General's Corps.</p>
<p class="note-body">That allocation, and those mentioned in the explanation of [former] subsection (c), below, have had the force of law since July 26, 1950, when the period for transfers, including the administrative authority to change these allocations, expired.</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;regular&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; throughout the revised section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), 10:506a(a) (1st proviso) is omitted, since there is no authority to appoint to a Regular grade above major general. 10:506a(a) (last 65 words of 2d proviso) is omitted as executed by the declaration of a national emergency on December 16, 1950.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1), the figures &ldquo;12&rdquo; and &ldquo;6&rdquo; result from the allocation of the original figures &ldquo;16&rdquo; and &ldquo;8&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(2), the figures &ldquo;3&rdquo; and &ldquo;2&rdquo; result from the allocation of the original figures &ldquo;4&rdquo; and &ldquo;2&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(3), the figure &ldquo;1&rdquo; results from the allocation of the original figure &ldquo;1&rdquo;. None was allocated to the Air Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(4), the figure &ldquo;1&rdquo; results from the allocation of the original figures &ldquo;2&rdquo; and &ldquo;1&rdquo;. (The major general was allocated to the Army, the brigadier general to the Air Force.)</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(5), the figures &ldquo;188&rdquo; and &ldquo;94&rdquo; result from the allocation of the original figures &ldquo;334&rdquo; and &ldquo;167&rdquo;. The allocation of 188 corresponds to the allotment made by the Secretary of War between the Air Corps and the Army exclusive of the Air Corps, the Medical Department, and the Chaplains, under 10:506a(a) (3d proviso). That proviso is omitted as executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words &ldquo;by law to hold any civil office under the United States&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;by Acts of Congress to hold appointments in the Diplomatic or Consular Service of the Government or to hold any civil office under the Government&rdquo;.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) For the purpose of this chapter and chapter 363 of this title and under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, a person receiving an original appointment as a reserve commissioned officer in the Army or an assignment to an officer category in which advanced education or training or special experience is required or will be directly used shall be credited at the time of such appointment or assignment with any service as a commissioned officer, except service as a commissioned warrant officer, that he performed as a regular officer on active duty or as a reserve officer in an active status in any armed force, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or the Public Health Service before such appointment or assignment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to authorize the Secretary of the Army to limit the amount of prior commissioned service with which a person may be credited under paragraph (1), or to deny any such credit, in the case of a person who is credited with constructive service under subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army shall credit a person who is receiving an original appointment as a reserve commissioned officer in the Army or an assignment to an officer category in which advanced education or training or special experience is required or will be directly used and who has advanced education or training or special experience with constructive service for such education, training, or experience as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) One year for each year of advanced education beyond the baccalaureate degree level, for persons assigned to officer categories requiring such advanced education or an advanced degree as a prerequisite for such assignment. In determining the number of years of constructive service to be credited under this clause to officers in any professional field, the Secretary concerned shall credit an officer with, but with not more than, the number of years of advanced education required by a ma<!-- PDFPage:1054 -->jority of institutions that award degrees in that professional field for completion of the advanced education or award of the advance degree.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) Credit for any period of advanced education in a health profession (other than medicine and dentistry) beyond the baccalaureate degree level which exceeds the basic education criteria for assignment as an officer in such health profession, if such advanced education will be directly used by the Army.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Credit for experience in a health profession (other than medicine or dentistry), if such experience will be directly used by the Army.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Additional credit of (i) not more than one year for internship or equivalent graduate medical, dental, or other formal professional training required by the armed forces, and (ii) not more than one year for each additional year of such graduate-level training or experience creditable toward certification in a specialty required by the Army.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Additional credit, in unusual cases, based on special experience in a particular field.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Additional credit for experience as a physician or dentist, if assigned to the Medical or Dental Corps.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as authorized by the Secretary of the Army in individual cases and under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense in the case of a medical or dental officer, the amount of constructive service credited an officer under this subsection may not exceed the amount required in order for the officer to be eligible for an original appointment in the grade of major.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Constructive service credited an officer under this subsection is in addition to any service credited that officer under subsection (a) and shall be credited at the time of the original appointment of the officer or his assignment to an officer category in which advanced education or training or special experience is required or will be directly used.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Constructive service may not be credited under subsection (b) for education, training, or experience obtained while serving as a commissioned officer (other than a warrant officer) on active duty or in an active status. However, in the case of an officer who completes advanced education or receives an advanced degree while in an active status and in less than the number of years normally required to complete such advanced education or receive such advanced degree, constructive service may, subject to regulations prescribed under subsection (a)(2), be credited to the officer under subsection (b)(1)(A) to the extent that the number of years normally required to complete such advanced education or receive such advanced degree exceeds the actual number of years in which such advanced education or degree is obtained by the officer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If the Secretary of Defense determines that the number of qualified judge advocates serving on active duty in the Army in grades below major is critically below the number needed by the Army in such grades, he may authorize the Secretary of the Army to credit any person receiving an original appointment with a view to assignment in the Judge Advocate General's Corps with a period of constructive service in such an amount (in addition to any period of service credited such person under subsection (b)(1)) as will result in the grade of such person being that of captain and the date of rank of such person being junior to that of all other officers of the same grade serving on active duty.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) For the purposes of subsections (b) and (c)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary shall, by regulation, prescribe the order of promotion of officers having the same amount of service computed under section 3360(b) of this title;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) An officer of an Army Reserve unit organized to serve as a unit may decline a promotion under section 3366 or 3367 of this title if the Secretary of the Army, or an officer designated by him, approves that action as being in the best interests of the Army.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) An officer of the Army National Guard of the United States may decline a promotion under section 3366 or 3367 of this title if the governor or other appropriate authority of the State, Territory or Puerto Rico or the commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard, whichever is concerned, approves that action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) If an officer declines a promotion under subsection (f) or (g), his name shall be retained on the appropriate promotion list for a period of not more than three years from the date he was selected for promotion to the grade concerned unless&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary of the Army may, in his discretion, extend the period for which a declination is in effect in the case of any officer of the Army National Guard who is an officer of an Alaska Scout Battalion or of a unit engaged in air defense activities on a tactical site that is under the control of the Army or the Air Force.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) At the end of the period during which his name is carried on the appropriate promotion list under subsection (h), or at any earlier time if he requests the promotion, an officer of the Army Reserve whose name is retained on the promotion list under that subsection shall be promoted to the grade concerned and shall be transferred from his unit unless, upon his promotion, he fills a vacancy in that unit.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Whenever the Secretary of the Army determines that, within the distribution of officers not assigned to units, there are existing or anticipated vacancies in the reserve grade of captain, major, or lieutenant colonel, he may convene a selection board to consider and recommend, for promotion to those grades, officers of the Army Reserve who are in an active status and who are not assigned to units organized to serve as units, reserve officers who are on active duty (other than for training), officers of any Army Reserve unit organized to serve as a unit, and officers of the Army National Guard of the United States. The Secretary shall prescribe for each zone of consideration list established under section 3364 of this title the minimum service, computed under section 3360(b) of this title, that an officer of the appropriate branch must have to be placed on that list. He shall require that each officer who has the prescribed service completed under that section, who is in an active status, and who is not assigned to a unit organized to serve as a unit, be placed on that list. Officers of any Army Reserve unit organized to serve as a unit, and officers of the Army National Guard of the United States, who have the prescribed service computed under that section, shall also be placed on that list. The Secretary shall prescribe the number to be recommended for promotion from each list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Subject to section 3380 of this title, an officer recommended for promotion under this section may be promoted whenever there is a vacancy, but it is not mandatory that the authorized number be maintained in any grade. Each officer of the Army National Guard of the United States who is recommended by a selection board for promotion under this section and who, before the date on which he would be promoted under this section, is appointed in the next higher grade to fill a vacancy in the Army National Guard and is federally recognized in that grade shall be promoted to that reserve grade effective as of the date on which he is so recognized. If he is not so appointed in the next higher grade in the Army National Guard and federally recognized in that grade, he shall, effective as of the date of the promotion under this section, have his Federal recognition terminated and be transferred to the Army Reserve. Each officer of an Army Reserve unit organized to serve as a unit who is promoted under this section shall, effective as of the date of that promotion, be transferred from his unit unless, upon his promotion, he fills a vacancy in that unit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A selection board considering officers under this section shall use one of the following methods, as directed by the Secretary of the Army:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) Consider the officers referred to it in the order of their service computed under section 3360(b) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) recommend those who are fully qualified for promotion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) pass over and report those not so qualified; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) continue this procedure until the number of officers specified by him is recommended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Recommend a number specified by him whom it considers to be the best qualified of those officers referred to it.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the method prescribed in clause (2) is used, the number recommended by the selection board must be at least 80 percent of the officers listed for consideration for the first time.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3370. Commissioned officers: promotion to grade of colonel to fill vacancies</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Whenever the Secretary of the Army determines that, within the distribution of officers not assigned to units, there are existing or anticipated vacancies in the reserve grade of colonel, he may convene a selection board to consider and recommend, to fill those vacancies, reserve officers who are in an active status and who are not assigned to units organized to serve as units, subject to section 3390 of this title, reserve officers who are on active duty (other than for training), officers of any unit of the Army Reserve organized to serve as a unit, and officers of the Army National Guard of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary shall prescribe for each zone of consideration list established under section <!-- PDFPage:1066 -->3364 of this title the amount of service computed under section 3360(b) of this title that an officer of the branch concerned must have to be placed on it for consideration under this section. So far as practicable, the amount of service prescribed shall correspond to that which an officer of the Regular Army in the same branch must have for consideration for promotion to the same grade. The Secretary shall require that each officer who is in an active status, who is not assigned to a unit organized to serve as a unit, and who has the prescribed service computed under that section, be placed on that list. Officers of any unit of the Army Reserve organized to serve as a unit, and any officer of the Army National Guard of the United States, who have the prescribed service computed under that section, shall also be placed on that list. He shall prescribe the number to be recommended for promotion from each list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A selection board considering officers under this section shall recommend the prescribed number of officers whom it considers to be the best qualified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Subject to section 3380 of this title, an officer recommended for promotion under this section may be promoted whenever there is a vacancy, but it is not mandatory that the authorized number be maintained in any grade. Each officer of the Army National Guard of the United States who is recommended for promotion under this section and who, before the date on which he would be promoted under this section, is appointed in the next higher grade to fill a vacancy in the Army National Guard and is federally recognized in that grade shall be promoted to that reserve grade effective as of the date on which he is so recognized. If he is not so appointed in the next higher grade in the Army National Guard and federally recognized in that grade, he shall, effective as of the date of the promotion under this section, have his Federal recognition terminated and be transferred to the Army Reserve. An officer of the Army National Guard of the United States may decline a promotion under this section if the governor or other appropriate authority of the State, Territory, or Puerto Rico, or the commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard, whichever is concerned, approves that action. If an officer of the Army National Guard of the United States so declines a promotion, his name shall be removed from the recommended list. Each officer of an Army Reserve unit organized to serve as a unit who is promoted under this section shall, effective as of the date of that promotion, be transferred from his unit unless upon his promotion he fills a vacancy in that unit. An officer of a unit of the Army Reserve organized to serve as a unit may decline a promotion under this section if the Secretary of the Army, or an officer designated by him, approves that action as being in the best interest of the Army. If an officer of a unit of the Army Reserve so declines a promotion, his name shall be removed from the recommended list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If an officer of the Army National Guard of the United States is found qualified for promotion under this section, section 3390 of this title applies in place of the examination for Federal recognition in the grade for which found qualified.</p>

The words &ldquo;his retired grade&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;permanent grade held at time of retirement&rdquo; to reflect the right to higher retired grade when qualified under other provisions of law. 10:941a(e) (last proviso of clause (1)) is omitted, since, under section 202 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 807 (37 U.S.C. 233), the active duty pay of all members of the Army is based upon years of service.</p>
<p class="note-body">In formula C, the computation is based on monthly pay instead of annual pay to conform to the other formulas of the revised section. The words &ldquo;basic pay&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;active duty base and longevity pay&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;in determining his basic pay&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;for longevity pay purposes&rdquo;, to conform to the terminology of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 802 (37 U.S.C. 231 et seq.). The words &ldquo;Monthly basic pay of member's retired grade&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;the rank upon which they are retired&rdquo;, in 10:971, and &ldquo;rank with which retired&rdquo;, in 10:971b, to reflect their right to advancement on the retired list. 10:971 now applies only when the retiring officer has 30 or more years of service which may be credited in computing his retired pay. 10:971b (2d proviso) is omitted, since, under section 202 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 807 (37 U.S.C. 233), the pay of all members is based upon cumulative years of service. 10:971b (4th proviso) is omitted as executed. 10:971b (last proviso) is omitted, since the distinction between limited and unlimited retired lists was abolished by section 201 of the act of June 29, 1948, ch. 708, 62 Stat. 1084. Sections 3918, 3920, and 3924 are included under this formula, since it achieves the same result as is reached on a basis of 30 years multiplied by 21/2 percent, and simplifies the table.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1109 --><p class="note-body">In formulas D and E, the words &ldquo;credited under section 3925&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;active Federal service&rdquo;, since that revised section makes explicit the service covered. The act of August 10, 1946, ch. 952, &sect;6(c), 60 Stat. 996, is not contained in 10:948. It is also omitted from the revised section as executed. 10:980 now applies only when the retiring enlisted member has at least 30 years of service which may be credited in computing his retired pay. However, as noted above, 10:980 is the only provision of law applicable to cases in which the retiring member has at least 30 years of service. The act of June 16, 1942, ch. 413, &sect;19 (63d through 75th words of 2d par.), 56 Stat. 369, repealed so much of the act of March 2, 1907, ch. 2513, 34 Stat. 1217, as provided allowances for enlisted men on the retired list. The repeal of section 19 of the act of June 16, 1942, by section 531(b)(34) of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 839, did not revive that portion of the act of March 2, 1907, which had been repealed by the act of June 16, 1942. Accordingly, the act of March 2, 1907, as thus modified by the act of June 16, 1942, is used as the basis for formula E.</p>
<p class="note-body">Footnote 2 reflects the long-standing construction of those provisions dealing with computation of retired pay which do not specifically provide that the member is entitled to compute his retired pay on the basis of the monthly basic pay to which he would be entitled if he were on active duty in his retired grade. Except in cases covered by formula C the pertinent basic computation provisions for such retirement either provide for computation of retired pay on the same basis as the provisions dealing with higher retired grade, or the basic retirement provisions were themselves enacted after the provisions authorizing higher retired grade. The provisos of 10:1002 and 1005 are omitted as surplusage, since no formula for the computation of retired pay includes inactive service on the retired list as a credit.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;at rates applicable on date of retirement and adjust to reflect later changes in permanent rates&rdquo;, in footnote 2; and all of footnote 4; are based on the source statutes incorporated in the formulas to which footnotes 2 and 4 apply.</p>
<p class="note-body">In footnote 4, the words &ldquo;and disregard a part of a year that is less than six months&rdquo; are made applicable to formulas A&mdash;E although this part of the rule is expressed only as to formula B, in 10:941a(e)(1). The legislative history of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (Hearings before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on H.R. 5007, 81st Congress, first session, p. 313, July 6, 1949) indicates that the provisions, upon which formulas A and C&mdash;E are based, should be construed to require that a part of a year that is less than six months be disregarded.</p>

The words &ldquo;may buy&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;shall *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* be permitted to purchase&rdquo;.

The words &ldquo;or to another executive department of the Government&rdquo; are omitted as superseded by section 7 of the Act of May 21, 1920, ch. 194, as amended (31 U.S.C. 686). The provisions of 10:1253 relating to computation of costs are omitted to reflect Title IV of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (63 Stat. 585), which authorized the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations governing the use and sale of certain inventories at cost, including applicable administrative expenses.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (i), 10:1196 (last 30 words) is omitted as superseded by the Act of April 27, 1914, ch. 72 (last proviso under &ldquo;Subsistence of the Army&rdquo;), 38 Stat. 361. The words &ldquo;So much of the&rdquo; and &ldquo;as may be necessary&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;members *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* on active duty, for the use of themselves and their families&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;officers for the use of themselves and their families, and to commanders of companies or other organizations, for the use of the enlisted men of their companies or organizations&rdquo;, to conform to 10:1237 and 1238. Those sections provide the basic authority for procurement and sale of subsistence supplies to all members. This interpretation conforms to established administrative practice under those sections. The word &ldquo;supplies&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;stores&rdquo;.</p>

They are also omitted from the revised section, since the National Homes for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers were dissolved by the Act of July 3, 1930, ch. 863, 46 Stat. 1016.

Although section 402(e) of the Army Organization Act of 1950, ch. 383, 64 Stat. 273, amended the Act of May 26, 1900, it did not have the effect of reviving that act. The word &ldquo;give&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;deliver&rdquo; to express more clearly the intent of the section. The words &ldquo;serviceable&rdquo; and &ldquo;as may be on hand undisposed of&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;is authorized and directed&rdquo;, since section 4684 of this title provides an alternative method for the disposal of obsolete cannon.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) As soon as practicable after the collection of the effects and money of the deceased, the summary court-martial shall send them at the expense of the United States to the living person highest on the following list who can be found by the court:</p>

<p class="note-body">Before the enactment of the National Security Act of 1947, the transport functions covered by this section were performed only by the Army. Under section 2(a)(3) of the National Security Act (as it existed before August 10, 1949), the sea and air transportation functions of the Army, Navy, and Air Force were respectively consolidated into the &ldquo;Military Sea Transportation Service&rdquo;, under the Department of the Navy, and the &ldquo;Military Air Transport Service&rdquo;, under the Department of the Air Force. Instead of having space on its own transport vessels and airplanes, the Army is now allotted bulk space on vessels and airplanes operated by those transport services. The words &ldquo;or, within bulk space allocations made to the Department of the Army, on vessels or airplanes operated by any military transport agency of the Department of Defense&rdquo; are inserted, in accordance with an opinion of the Judge Advocate General of the Army (JAGA 1953/5885, 22 July 1953), to make clear that the rule applicable to Army vessels and airplanes applies to the bulk space allocated to the Army.
