<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><em>(11) <em>INDECENT LIBERTY</em></em><em>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;indecent liberty&rdquo; means indecent conduct, but physical contact is not required. It includes one who with the requisite intent exposes one's genitalia, anus, buttocks, or female areola or nipple to a child. An indecent liberty may consist of communication of indecent language as long as the communication is made in the physical presence of the child. If words designed to excite sexual desire are spoken to a child, or a child is exposed to or involved in sexual conduct, it is an indecent liberty; the child's consent is not relevant.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><em>(12) <em>INDECENT CONDUCT</em></em><em>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;indecent conduct&rdquo; means that form of immorality relating to sexual impurity which is grossly vulgar, obscene, and repugnant to common propriety, and tends to excite sexual desire or deprave morals with respect to sexual relations.

<p class="statutory-body-1em"><em>(14) <em>CONSENT</em></em><em>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;consent&rdquo; means words or overt acts indicating a freely given agreement to the sexual conduct at issue by a competent person. An expression of lack of consent through words or conduct means there is no consent. Lack of verbal or physical resistance or submission resulting from the accused's use of force, threat of force, or placing another person in fear does not constitute consent. A current or previous dating relationship by itself or the manner of dress of the person involved with the accused in the sexual conduct at issue shall not constitute consent. A person cannot consent to sexual activity if&mdash;</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><em>(A) under 16 years of age; or</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em"><em>(B) substantially incapable of&mdash;</em></p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em"><em>(15) <em>MISTAKE OF FACT AS TO CONSENT</em></em><em>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;mistake of fact as to consent&rdquo; means the accused held, as a result of ignorance or mistake, an incorrect belief that the other person engaging in the sexual conduct consented. The ignorance or mistake must have existed in the mind of the accused and must have been reasonable under all the circumstances. To be reasonable the ignorance or mistake must have been based on information, or lack of it, which would indicate to a reasonable person that the other person consented. Additionally, the ignorance or mistake cannot be based on the negligent failure to discover the true facts. Negligence is the absence of due care. Due care is what a reasonably careful person would do under the same or similar circumstances. The accused's state of intoxication, if any, at the time of the offense is not relevant to mistake of fact. A mistaken belief that the other person consented must be that which a reasonably careful, ordinary, prudent, sober adult would have had under the circumstances at the time of the offense.</em></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em"><em>(16) <em>AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE</em></em><em>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;affirmative defense&rdquo; means any special defense which, although not denying that the accused committed the objective acts constituting the offense <!-- PDFPage:417 -->charged, denies, wholly, or partially, criminal responsibility for those acts. The accused has the burden of proving the affirmative defense by a preponderance of evidence. After the defense meets this burden, the prosecution shall have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the affirmative defense did not exist.</em></p>
