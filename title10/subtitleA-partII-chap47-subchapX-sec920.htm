It is not an affirmative defense that the accused reasonably believed that the child had attained the age of 12 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Sixteen years</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In a prosecution under subsection (d) (aggravated sexual assault of a child), subsection (f) (aggravated sexual abuse of a child), subsection (i) (abusive sexual contact with a child), or subsection (j) (indecent liberty with a child), it need not be proven that the accused knew that the other person engaging in the sexual act, contact, or liberty had not attained the age of 16 years.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this subsection, a marriage is a relationship, recognized by the laws of a competent State or foreign jurisdiction, between the accused and the other person as spouses. A marriage exists until it is dissolved in accordance with the laws of a competent State or foreign jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Paragraph (1) shall not apply if the accused's intent at the time of the sexual conduct is to abuse, humiliate, or degrade any person.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(r) <cap-smallcap>Consent and Mistake of Fact as to Consent</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Lack of permission is an element of the offense in subsection (m) (wrongful sexual contact). Consent and mistake of fact as to consent are not an issue, or an affirmative defense, in a prosecution under any other subsection, except they are an affirmative defense for the sexual conduct in issue in a prosecution under subsection (a) (rape), subsection (c) (aggravated sexual assault), subsection (e) (aggravated sexual contact), and subsection (h) (abusive sexual contact).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Force</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;force&rdquo; means action to compel submission of another or to overcome or prevent another's resistance by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the use or display of a dangerous weapon or object;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the suggestion of possession of a dangerous weapon or object that is used in a manner to cause another to believe it is a dangerous weapon or object; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) physical violence, strength, power, or restraint applied to another person, sufficient that the other person could not avoid or escape the sexual conduct.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) <cap-smallcap>Indecent liberty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;indecent liberty&rdquo; means indecent conduct, but physical contact is not required. It includes one who with the requisite intent exposes one's genitalia, anus, buttocks, or female areola or nipple to a child. An indecent liberty may consist of communication of indecent language as long as the communication is made in the physical presence of the child. If words designed to excite sexual desire are spoken to a child, or a child is exposed to or involved in sexual conduct, it is an indecent liberty; the child's consent is not relevant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) <cap-smallcap>Indecent conduct</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;indecent conduct&rdquo; means that form of immorality relating to sexual impurity which is grossly vulgar, obscene, and repugnant to common propriety, and tends to excite sexual desire or deprave morals with respect to sexual relations. Indecent conduct includes observing, or making a videotape, photograph, motion picture, print, negative, slide, or other mechanically, electronically, or chemically reproduced visual material, without another person's consent, and contrary to that other person's reasonable expectation of privacy, of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that other person while that other person is engaged in a sexual act, sodomy (under section 925 (article 125)), or sexual contact.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) <cap-smallcap>Act of prostitution</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;act of prostitution&rdquo; means a sexual act, sexual contact, or lewd act for the purpose of receiving money or other compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) <cap-smallcap>Consent</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;consent&rdquo; means words or overt acts indicating a freely given agreement to the sexual conduct at issue by a competent person. An expression of lack of consent through words or conduct means there is no consent. Lack of verbal or physical resistance or submission resulting from the accused's use of force, threat of force, or placing another person in fear does not constitute consent. A current or previous dating relationship by itself or the manner of dress of the person involved with the accused in the sexual conduct at issue shall not constitute consent. A person cannot consent to sexual activity if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) under 16 years of age; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) substantially incapable of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) appraising the nature of the sexual conduct at issue due to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) mental impairment or unconsciousness resulting from consumption of alcohol, drugs, a similar substance, or otherwise; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) physically declining participation in the sexual conduct at issue; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) physically communicating unwillingness to engage in the sexual conduct at issue.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) <cap-smallcap>Mistake of fact as to consent</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;mistake of fact as to consent&rdquo; means the accused held, as a result of ignorance or mistake, an incorrect belief that the other person engaging in the sexual conduct consented. The ignorance or mistake must have existed in the mind of the accused and must have been reasonable under all the circumstances. To be reasonable the ignorance or mistake must have been based on information, or lack of it, which would indicate to a reasonable person that the other person consented. Additionally, the ignorance or mistake cannot be based on the negligent failure to discover the true facts. Negligence is the absence of due care. Due care is what a reasonably careful person would do under the same or similar circumstances. The accused's state of intoxication, if any, at the time of the offense is not relevant to mistake of fact. A mistaken belief that the other person consented must be that which a reasonably careful, ordinary, prudent, sober adult would have had under the circumstances at the time of the offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) <cap-smallcap>Affirmative defense</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;affirmative defense&rdquo; means any special defense which, although not denying that the accused committed the objective acts constituting the offense charged, denies, wholly, or partially, criminal responsibility for those acts. The accused has the burden of proving the affirmative defense by a preponderance of evidence. After the defense meets this burden, the prosecution shall have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the affirmative defense did not exist.</p>
