<h4 class="note-head">Support for Peacekeeping Activities</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 1342(a) of Pub. L. 102&ndash;484 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) International peacekeeping activities contribute to the national interests of the United States in maintaining global stability and order.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) International peacekeeping activities take many forms and include observer missions, ceasefire monitoring, human rights monitoring, refugee and humanitarian assistance, monitoring and conducting elections, monitoring of police in the demobilization of former combatants, and reforming judicial and other civil and administrative systems of government.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) International peacekeeping activities traditionally involve the presence of military troops, police forces, and, in recent years, civilian experts in transportation, logistics, medicine, electoral systems, human rights, land tenure, other economic and social issues, and other areas of expertise.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) International peacekeeping activities serve both the foreign policy interests and defense policy interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The normal budget process of authorizing and appropriating funds a year in advance and reprogramming such funds is insufficient to satisfy the need for funds for peacekeeping efforts arising from an unanticipated crisis.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Greater flexibility is needed to ensure the timely availability of funding to provide for peacekeeping activities.&rdquo;</p>
