<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the exercise is undertaken primarily to enhance the security interests of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary of Defense determines that the participation by such country is necessary to the achievement of the fundamental objectives of the exercise and that those objectives cannot be achieved unless the United States provides the incremental expenses incurred by such country.</p>
