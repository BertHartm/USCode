<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), all references to the appointment of assistant chiefs are omitted as covered by sections 3037 and 3040 of this title.

The word &ldquo;select&rdquo; is substituted for the word &ldquo;appoint&rdquo;, since the filling of the offices is not appointment to an office in the constitutional sense.

As restated in section 3036(c), it now applies only to the officers named in section 3036(b), which excludes the two officers named.
