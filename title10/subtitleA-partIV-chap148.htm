<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Assistance Authorized</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense may provide technical and other assistance to facilitate the achievement of the purposes of projects conducted under the program. In providing such assistance, the Secretary shall make available, as appropriate for the work to be performed, equipment and facilities of Department of Defense laboratories (including the scientists and engineers at those laboratories) for purposes of projects selected by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Financial Commitment of Non-Federal Government Participants</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The total amount of funds provided by the Federal Government for a project conducted under the program may not exceed 50 percent of the total cost of the project. However, the Secretary of Defense may agree to a project in which the total amount of funds provided by the Federal Government exceeds 50 percent if the Secretary determines the project is particularly meritorious, but the project would not otherwise have sufficient non-Federal funding or in-kind contributions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may prescribe regulations to provide for consideration of in-kind contributions by non-Federal Government participants in a project conducted under the program for the purpose of calculating the share of the project costs that has been or is being undertaken by such participants. In such regulations, the Secretary may authorize a participant that is a small business concern to use funds received under the Small Business Innovation Research Program or the Small Business Technology Transfer Program to help pay the costs of project activities. Any such funds so used may be considered in calculating the amount of the financial commitment undertaken by the non-Federal Government participants unless the Secretary determines that the small business concern has not made a significant equity percentage contribution in the project from non-Federal sources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall consider a project proposal submitted by a small business concern without regard to the ability of the small business concern to immediately meet its share of the anticipated project costs. Upon the selection of a project proposal submitted by a small busi<!-- PDFPage:924 -->ness concern, the small business concern shall have a period of not less than 120 days in which to arrange to meet its financial commitment requirements under the project from sources other than a person of a foreign country. If the Secretary determines upon the expiration of that period that the small business concern will be unable to meet its share of the anticipated project costs, the Secretary shall revoke the selection of the project proposal submitted by the small business concern.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Selection Process</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Competitive procedures shall be used in the conduct of the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Selection Criteria</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The criteria for the selection of projects under the program shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The extent to which the proposed project advances and enhances the national security objectives set forth in section 2501(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The technical excellence of the proposed project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The qualifications of the personnel proposed to participate in the research activities of the proposed project.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The potential effectiveness of the project in the further development and application of each technology proposed to be developed by the project for the national technology and industrial base.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The extent of the financial commitment of eligible firms to the proposed project.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Establishment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall establish a Manufacturing Technology Program to further the national security objectives of section 2501(a) of this title. The Secretary shall use the joint planning process of the directors of the Department of Defense laboratories in establishing the program. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology shall administer the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose of Program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall use the program&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide centralized guidance and direction (including goals, milestones, and priorities) to the military departments and the Defense Agencies on all matters relating to manufacturing technology;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to direct the development and implementation of Department of Defense plans, programs, projects, activities, and policies that promote the development and application of advanced technologies to manufacturing processes, tools, and equipment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to improve the manufacturing quality, productivity, technology, and practices of businesses and workers providing goods and services to the Department of Defense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to promote dual-use manufacturing processes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to disseminate information concerning improved manufacturing improvement concepts, including information on such matters as best manufacturing practices, product data exchange specifications, computer-aided acquisition and logistics support, and rapid acquisition of manufactured parts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to sustain and enhance the skills and capabilities of the manufacturing work force;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to promote high-performance work systems (with development and dissemination of production technologies that build upon the skills and capabilities of the work force), high levels of worker education and training; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) to ensure appropriate coordination between the manufacturing technology programs and industrial preparedness programs of the Department of Defense and similar programs undertaken by other departments and agencies of the Federal Government or by the private sector.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Execution</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may carry out projects under the program through the Secretaries of the military departments and the heads of the Defense Agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall seek, to the extent practicable, the participation of manufacturers of manufacturing equipment in the projects under the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Competition and Cost Sharing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Competitive procedures shall be used for awarding all grants and entering into all contracts, cooperative agreements, and other transactions under the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A grant may not be awarded under the program, and a contract, cooperative agreement, or other transaction may not be entered into under the program, on any basis other than a cost-sharing basis unless the Secretary of Defense determines that the grant, contract, cooperative agreement, or other transaction, as the case may be, is for a program that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is not likely to have any immediate and direct commercial application;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is of sufficiently high risk to discourage cost sharing by non-Federal Government sources; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) will be carried out by an institution of higher education.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) At least 25 percent of the funds available for the program each fiscal year shall be used for awarding grants and entering into contracts, cooperative agreements, and other transactions on a cost-share basis under which the ratio of recipient cost to Government cost is two to one.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the requirement of paragraph (3) cannot be met by July 15 of a fiscal year, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology may waive the requirement and obligate the balance of the funds available for the program for that fiscal year on a cost-share basis under which the ratio of recipient cost to Government cost is less than two to one. Before implementing any such waiver, the Under Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives the reasons for the waiver.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply in the case of a memorandum of understanding or agreement described in paragraph (1) if the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of State, determines that a transfer of United States defense technology pursuant to such understanding or agreement will result in strengthening the national security of the United States and so certifies to Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a United States firm is required under the terms of a memorandum of understanding, or other agreement entered into by the United States with a foreign country, to transfer defense technology to a foreign country, the United States firm may protest the determination to the Secretary of Defense on the grounds that the transfer of such technology would adversely affect the defense industrial base of the United States and would result in substantial financial loss to the protesting firm. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of State, shall make the final determination of the validity of the protesting firm's claim.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 825(a) of Pub. L. 100&ndash;456 provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Many contracts entered into by United States firms for the supply of weapon systems or defense-related items to foreign countries and foreign firms are subject to contractual arrangements under which United States firms must agree&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) to have a specified percentage of work under, or monetary amount of, the contract performed by one or more foreign firms;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) to purchase a specified amount or quantity of unrelated goods or services from domestic sources of such foreign countries; or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) to invest a specified amount in domestic businesses of such foreign countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Such contractual arrangements, known as &lsquo;offsets&rsquo;, are a component of international trade and could <!-- PDFPage:931 -->have an impact on United States defense industry opportunities in domestic and foreign markets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Some United States contractors and subcontractors may be adversely affected by such contractual arrangements.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Many contracts which provide for or are subject to offset arrangements require, in connection with such arrangements, the transfer of United States technology to foreign firms.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The use of such transferred technology by foreign firms in conjunction with foreign trade practices permitted under the trade policies of the countries of such firms can give foreign firms a competitive advantage against United States firms in world markets for products using such technology.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) A purchase of defense equipment pursuant to an offset arrangement may increase the cost of the defense equipment to the purchasing country and may reduce the amount of defense equipment that a country may purchase.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The exporting of defense equipment produced in the United States is important to maintain the defense industrial base of the United States, lower the unit cost of such equipment to the Department of Defense, and encourage the standardized utilization of United States equipment by the allies of the United States.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(1) The President shall enter into negotiations with foreign countries that have a policy of requiring an offset arrangement in connection with the purchase of defense equipment or supplies from the United States. The negotiations should be conducted with a view to achieving an agreement with the countries concerned that would limit the adverse effects that such arrangements have on the defense industrial base of each such country.
