<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Indirect Cost That Violates a FAR Cost Principle</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The head of an agency shall require that a covered contract provide that if the contractor submits to the agency a proposal for settlement of indirect costs incurred by the contractor for any period after such costs have been accrued and if that proposal includes the submission of a cost which is unallowable because the cost violates a cost principle in the Federal Acquisition Regulation or applicable agency supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the cost shall be disallowed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Penalty for Violation of Cost Principle</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the head of the agency determines that a cost submitted by a contractor in its proposal for settlement is expressly unallowable under a cost principle referred to in subsection (a) that defines the allowability of specific selected costs, the head of the agency shall assess a penalty against the contractor in an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the amount of the disallowed cost allocated to covered contracts for which a proposal for settlement of indirect costs has been submitted; plus</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Waiver of Penalty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide for a penalty under subsection (b) to be waived in the case of a contractor's proposal for settlement of indirect costs when&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of unallowable costs subject to the penalty is insignificant; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the contractor demonstrates, to the contracting officer's satisfaction, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) it has established appropriate policies and personnel training and an internal control and review system that provide assurances that unallowable costs subject to penalties are precluded from being included in the contractor's proposal for settlement of indirect costs; and</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (e)(1)(L) is based on section 2399 of this title as enacted by Pub. L. 97&ndash;295, &sect;1(29)(A), Oct. 12, 1982, 96 Stat. 1293.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 1(f)(2) of the bill would transfer the provisions of existing 10 U.S.C. 2399 to a new subparagraph (L) of 10 U.S.C. 2324(e)(1). The existing section 2399 prohibits the use of appropriated funds to reimburse a defense contractor for insurance against the contractor's costs of correcting defects in the contractor's materials or workmanship. The transfer would add the provision to the list of contractor costs which are not allowable as expenses which may be paid by the Department of Defense under a contract. This allowable cost limitation applies only to contracts for more than $100,000 other than fixed price contracts without cost incentives (see 10 US.C. 2324(k)). The committee determined that it is appropriate to treat the subject matter of section 2399 in the same manner as other provisions relating to allowable costs of defense contractors and notes that section 2324, providing a more comprehensive treatment of allowable costs, was enacted after section 2399. The committee recognizes that contracts for amounts less than $100,000 and fixed price contracts without cost incentives are covered by the existing section 2399 and would not be covered by the provision as transferred. The committee determined that in practice the existing section 2399 would not have significant applicability to such contracts and that the transfer is appropriate as part of this bill.</p>
