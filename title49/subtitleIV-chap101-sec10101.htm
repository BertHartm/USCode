The words &ldquo;United States Postal Service&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Postal Service&rdquo; to reflect the complete name of the Government agency.

The words &ldquo;fair and&rdquo; are omitted to eliminate redundancy. The words &ldquo;subject to this subtitle&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this act&rdquo; for clarity and to conform to the revised title.</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>Clarification of use of &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; and &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo;</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Throughout the bill, the term &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;just and reasonable&rdquo; and &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;preference&rdquo;, &ldquo;prejudice&rdquo;, &ldquo;advantage&rdquo;, and &ldquo;disadvantage&rdquo; for clarity, consistency, and to conform to modern usage. See <em>Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Co. v. Harriman,</em> 227 U.S. 657, 1913; <em>United States v. P. Koenig Coal Co.,</em> 270 U.S. 512, 1926; <em>Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co.,</em> 284 U.S. 370, 1932; <em>Union Pacific R. Co. v. United States,</em> 313 U.S. 450, 1941; <em>Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co.,</em> 315 U.S. 575, 1942; <em>Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co.,</em> 320 U.S. 591, 1944; <em>United States ex rel. Morris v. Delaware, L. & W.R. Co.,</em> 40 F. 101, Cir. Ct. N.Y., 1889. The change does not affect the substantive law. The words for which the substitutions are made are used inconsistently throughout the Interstate Commerce Act and related laws and are often used in series with other synonymous words. As the editors of the U.S. Code Service point out in an explanatory note to section 2 of title 49:</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Explanatory note.</em>&mdash;In using the annotations following, it must be borne in mind that the words &ldquo;unjust discrimination&rdquo; [the term employed in this section] and &ldquo;preference and prejudice&rdquo; [the terms employed in &sect;3(1) of this title] have been used in innumerable instances by the courts and by the commission as interchangeable. The Elkins Act [&sect;&sect;41&ndash;43 of this title] employs the word &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; without the qualifying adjective &ldquo;unjust.&rdquo; It is impossible in the great majority of cases to determine from the opinions whether this section, or &sect;3(1) of this title, or the Elkins Act [&sect;&sect;41&ndash;43 of this title] was the basis of the decision, because of the use of the terms interchangeably, or the use of &ldquo;unjust discrimination&rdquo; as covering violations of &sect;3(1) of this title, or the omission to specify the particular provision of law under immediate consideration, or because both this section and &sect;3(1) of this title, may have been pleaded and referred to as the basis of the decision. There is some similar confusion in the cases between this section and the provisions of &sect;1(5) of this title, requiring all rates to be just and reasonable, and &sect;1(6) of this title, requiring just and reasonable classifications, and transportation regulations and practices.</p>
<p class="note-body">While the amendments made to the Interstate Commerce Act by Public Law 94&ndash;210 continued the use of the multiple synonyms, that continuation is not significant since those amendments did not restate the entire act. Should a question ever arise concerning this change, section 3 of the bill would require the legal conclusion that no change in substance was intended. The following table identifies those sections of the Interstate Commerce Act that use the terms discussed in this note.</p>
