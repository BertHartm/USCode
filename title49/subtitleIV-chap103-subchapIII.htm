The Commission may appoint an individual nominated under subsection (b) of this section as a member of a joint board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The member of a joint board from a State shall be nominated by the State authority having jurisdiction to regulate intrastate transportation by motor vehicle on the highways of that State. If there is no such authority in that State or if that authority does not nominate a member when requested by the Commission, the chief executive officer of the State may nominate the member. If both that State authority and the chief executive officer of that State do not nominate a member when requested, the board is constituted without a member from that State if the Commission has appointed members for at least 2 other States to the board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When a matter required to be referred to a joint board involves the operation of a motor carrier in or through a place outside the United States, if only one State is involved or if only one State nominates an individual to be a member of the joint board, that State may nominate and the Commission may appoint not more than 3 members to the board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A substitution in the membership of a joint board may be made at any time in the same manner as an initial nomination and appointment under this section.</p>

When a joint board makes a report instead of an initial decision, the Commission shall decide the matter. The Commission may consider the conclusions of the joint board in making its decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A joint board may make an initial decision or report of its conclusions only by a majority vote. However, if only one member of the board participates in the proceeding, that member shall make the initial decision alone.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When a member of a joint board does not participate in a proceeding referred to that board, after notice of the proceeding, the State from which that member was appointed waives its right to act in that proceeding. The waiver does not affect the duty or power of remaining members of the board to continue the proceeding and make an initial decision.</p>
