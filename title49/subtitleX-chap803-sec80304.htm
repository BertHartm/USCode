<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1), the words &ldquo;may designate&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;is empowered to authorize, or designate&rdquo; in 49 App.:783 (1st sentence) to eliminate unnecessary words. The word &ldquo;employees&rdquo; is added for clarity and consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (a)(2) and (b)(3), the word &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;such rules and regulations as may be necessary&rdquo; in 49 App.:788 and 789 for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code and because &ldquo;rules&rdquo; and &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; are synonymous.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;shall carry out this chapter in Guam&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;In Guam the enforcement and administration of this chapter shall be performed&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c) is added because, under section 502(a)(2) of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America, as enacted by the Act of March 24, 1976 (Public Law 94&ndash;241, 90 Stat. 263), and proclaimed to be in effect by the President on January 9, 1978 (Proc.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the word &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;by such officers, agents, or other persons as may be authorized or designated for that purpose by the Secretary of the Treasury&rdquo; because of subsection (a)(1) of this section. The words &ldquo;or the Governor of Guam or of the Northern Mariana Islands as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section&rdquo; are added because under 49 App.:789 the Governor of Guam enforces 49 App.:ch. 11 in Guam and because of section 502(a)(2) of the Covenant referred to in the revision note for subsection (c) of this section. The words &ldquo;the customs laws&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;That such duties as are imposed upon the collector of customs or any other person with respect to the seizure and forfeiture of vessels and vehicles under the customs laws&rdquo; because of the restatement and to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
