<p class="statutory-body">(D) Subject to subparagraph (F) of this paragraph, any intrastate transportation authorized by issuance of a certificate under this paragraph shall be deemed to be transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title. Upon issuance of such certificate, the carrier shall establish initial rates, rules, and practices applicable to such transportation to the same extent and in the same manner as a motor common carrier of passengers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under such subchapter establishes rates, rules, and practices applicable to such interstate transportation. Any such rate, rule, or practice (including changes thereto) shall be subject to the provisions of chapter 107 of this title as if such rate, rule, or practice were related to interstate transportation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) The provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection relating to the Commission finding that transportation to be authorized by issuance of a certificate is not consistent with the public interest shall not apply to any application under this subsection for authority to provide&mdash;</p>

The President of the United States may extend, beyond such four-year period, such moratorium or impose such a moratorium with respect to any contiguous foreign country or political subdivision thereof which substantially prohibits grants of authority to persons from the United States to provide transportation by motor vehicle for compensation in such foreign country or political subdivision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The President of the United States may remove or modify, in whole or in part, any moratorium imposed under paragraph (1) of this subsection on the issuance of certificates or permits if the President determines that such removal or modification is in the national interest and notifies, in writing, the Congress of such removal or modification before the date on which such removal or modification is to take effect. In any case in which such moratorium applies to a contiguous foreign country or political subdivision thereof which substantially prohibits grants of authority to persons from the United States to provide transportation by motor vehicle for compensation in such foreign country or political subdivision, such removal or modification shall not take effect before the 60th day following the date on which the Congress is notified of such removal or modification.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Subject to clause (v) of this subsection, if the person to be issued the certificate of registration during the moratorium is a foreign motor private carrier domiciled in the foreign country or political subdivision or is a foreign motor private carrier owned or controlled by persons of the foreign country or political subdivision, such certificate may only authorize such carrier to provide transportation of property (including exempt items) by motor vehicle in a municipality in the United States which is adjacent to the foreign country or political subdivision, in contiguous municipalities in the United States any one of which is adjacent to the foreign country or political subdivision, or in a zone in the United States that is adjacent to, and commercially a part of, the municipality or municipalities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) If the person to be issued the certificate of registration during the moratorium is a foreign motor carrier domiciled in the foreign country or political subdivision and owned or controlled by persons of the United States, such certificate may only authorize such carrier to provide interstate transportation of property (including exempt items) by motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) If the person to be issued the certificate of registration during the moratorium is a foreign motor private carrier domiciled in the foreign country or political subdivision and owned or controlled by persons of the United States, such certificate may only authorize such carrier to provide interstate transportation of property (including exempt items) by motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vi) In this subparagraph, the terms &ldquo;exempt items&rdquo;, &ldquo;foreign motor carrier&rdquo;, &ldquo;foreign motor private carrier&rdquo;, and &ldquo;interstate transportation&rdquo; have the meanings such terms have under section 10530(a) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Limited Modification to Moratorium on Issuance of Certificates or Permits With Respect to Mexico</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, May 6, 1993, 58 F.R. 27647, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Secretary of Transportation</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 [see 49 U.S.C. 10922(m)(1), (2)] imposed a moratorium on the issuance of certificates or permits to motor carriers domiciled in, or owned or controlled by persons of, a contiguous foreign country. The Act authorized the President to remove the moratorium in whole or in <!-- PDFPage:302 -->part for any country or political subdivision thereof upon determining that such action is in the national interest. Sixty days&rsquo; advance notice to the Congress is required whenever the removal or modification applies to a contiguous foreign country or political subdivision thereof that substantially prohibits the granting of motor carrier authority to persons from the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">I am pleased that an agreement between the United States and Mexico has been concluded to ensure fair and reciprocal treatment for charter and tour bus interests on both sides of the border. The agreement reached, however, does not allow for full access to cross-border and domestic markets. Therefore, the moratorium must reflect the conditions under which operating authority may be issued to Mexican charter and tour companies under the agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, 49 U.S.C. section 10922(<em>l</em>)(2)(A) [now 10922(m)(2)(A)], I hereby make a limited modification to the moratorium imposed by that section and all actions taken by my predecessors under that section on the issuance of certificates or permits to motor carriers domiciled in, or owned or controlled by persons of, a contiguous foreign country.</p>
<p class="note-body">The moratorium is modified only to authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission to grant Mexican motor carriers authority to transport passengers in charter or special operations, in foreign commerce, in round trip or one-way service between Mexico and the United States pursuant to the following restrictions:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. The Mexican motor carrier can conduct cross-border charter or special service in the United States only when the international tour or charter begins in Mexico;</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Tickets or tour packages for such operations cannot be sold in the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The terms of the grants of authority given to Mexican motor carriers will be limited by the life of the agreement with Mexico covering reciprocal cross-border charter and special operations.</p>
<p class="note-body">This action applies only to international charter and tour operations, does not allow for point-to-point service within the United States, and does not authorize companies to conduct cross-border regular route service. This action preserves the status quo with respect to Mexican trucking companies and Mexican companies engaged in regular route service, and will maintain the moratorium on those operations through September 25, 1994, unless earlier revoked or modified.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, you are directed to notify the Congress today on my behalf that, effective 60 days hence, the moratorium will no longer be in effect for Mexican charter and tour bus companies subject to the above stated conditions. Because of this action, the Interstate Commerce Commission will then accept and process expeditiously all applications for operating authority from Mexican owned, controlled, or domiciled charter and tour bus firms. I should note that applications in Mexico by United States charter and tour bus firms will be similarly treated.</p>
<p class="note-body">You are hereby authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.</p>

Sixty days&rsquo; advance notice to the Congress is required whenever the removal or modification applies to a foreign contiguous country or political subdivision thereof that substantially prohibits the granting of motor carrier authority to persons from the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">As set forth in the Statement of Administrative Action regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that I submitted to the Congress on November 3, 1993, the moratorium with respect to Mexico will be lifted in phases to coincide with the schedule of liberalization in the relevant provisions of the NAFTA. The NAFTA specifically states that the moratorium will not apply to the provision of cross-border charter or tour bus services as of the date of entry into force of the Agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body">This is to give public notice that, pursuant to section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, 49 U.S.C. section 10922(<em>l</em>)(2)(A) [now 10922(m)(2)(A)], on November 3, 1993, I gave the Congress notice of my intention to make a limited modification to the moratorium imposed by that section and all actions taken by my predecessors under that section on the issuance of certificates or permits to motor carriers domiciled in, or owned or controlled by, persons of Mexico. This modification will take effect on January 1, 1994, the 60th day after my notice to the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">The moratorium is modified only to authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission to grant Mexican motor carriers authority to transport passengers in charter or tour bus operations, in foreign commerce, in round-trip or one-way service between Mexico and the United States.</p>
