However, the Secretary may prescribe an alternative notice requirement, of at least 25 days, to allow an air carrier or foreign air carrier to match a proposed change in a passenger fare or a charge of another air carrier or foreign air carrier. A notice under this paragraph must state plainly the change proposed and when the change will take effect.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Rejection of Changes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may reject a tariff or tariff change that is not consistent with this section and regulations prescribed by the Secretary. A tariff or change that is rejected is void.</p>

<p class="note-body">In this section, the words &ldquo;foreign air transportation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;air transportation&rdquo; because 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(B) provides that 49 App.:1373 no longer applies to interstate or overseas air transportation and 49 App.:1376(a)&ndash;(e), restated in section 41901 of the revised title, governs rates for the transportation of mail by aircraft. See section 40102(a) of the revised title defining &ldquo;air transportation&rdquo; to mean interstate or foreign air transportation or the transportation of mail by aircraft. The words &ldquo;passenger fare&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;fare&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the word &ldquo;print&rdquo; is omitted as being included in &ldquo;publish&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;places&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;points&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. In clause (1)(A), the word &ldquo;services&rdquo; is omitted as being included in &ldquo;practices&rdquo;. In clauses (1)(B) and (2)(A), the word &ldquo;lawful&rdquo; is omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;for foreign air transportation&rdquo; are added because of 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(B). See the revision notes for subsection (a) of this section. The words &ldquo;in the same way as required for a tariff under&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;in accordance with&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;proposed change in a passenger fare or a charge of another air carrier or foreign air carrier&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;fares or charges specified in another air carrier's or foreign air carrier's proposed tariff&rdquo; for clarity and consistency in this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;not covered by&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;to which such range of fares does not apply&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 1482(d)(4) of this Appendix .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. section 1482(d)(7) of this Appendix&rdquo; are omitted because those sections related to interstate and overseas air transportation and the source provisions restated in this section relate to foreign air transportation. In addition, the text of 49 App.:1551(a)(5)(D) provides that 49 App.:1482(d) ceased to be in effect on January 1, 1985, except as related to foreign air transportation. The reference in the source provisions to &ldquo;section 1482(j)(9) of this Appendix&rdquo; has been restated as though it were a reference to 49 App.:1482(j)(10) to correct an apparent error in the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979 (Public Law 96&ndash;192, 94 Stat. 35). Section 24(b) of S. 1300 of the 96th Congress (the derivative source for the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979), as originally passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, restated section 403(c)(2) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85&ndash;726, 72 Stat. 759) to read as it now does with a cross&ndash;reference to section 1002(j)(9) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. Also contained in those versions of S. 1300 in section 24(a) was an amendment to section 1002(j) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to add a paragraph (9) that contained language identical to what is now section 1002(j)(10) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. When S. 1300 was reported by the conference committee and enacted into law as the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979, section 24(a) had been changed so that a different paragraph (9) was added and what had been paragraph (9) was now designated as a new paragraph (10) to be added. Apparently, when the conference committee redesignated section 1002(j)(9) as 1002(j)(10) it did not make a corresponding change in the cross&ndash;reference in section 403(c)(2). See 125 Cong. Rec. 26936, 32147, 36939.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Notice Required Before Modifying, Suspending, or Ending Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A commuter air carrier that has an agreement with an air carrier to provide transportation for passengers and property that includes through service by the commuter air carrier over the commuter air carrier's routes and air transportation provided by the air carrier shall give the air carrier and the Secretary at least 90 days&rsquo; notice before modifying, suspending, or ending the transportation. If the commuter air carrier does not give that notice, the uniform method of establishing joint prices and divisions of joint prices referred to in subsection (b) of this section does not apply to the commuter air carrier.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the text of 49 App.:1482a(2)(A) is omitted as unnecessary because the definition of &ldquo;air carrier&rdquo; in 49 App.:1301(3) is restated in section 40102(a) of the revised title and applies to this section and because the functions of the Civil Aeronautics Board under 49 App.:1482a were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation by 49 App.:1551(b)(1)(E) and the complete name of the Secretary is used the first time the term appears in a section. The text of 49 App.:1482a(3) is omitted as executed. The reference in the source provisions to &ldquo;section 416(b)(3) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 [49 App. U.S.C. 1386(b)(3)]&rdquo; has been restated as though it were a reference to section 416(b)(4) to correct an apparent error in the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95&ndash;504, 92 Stat. 1705). Section 24 of H.R. 12611 of the 95th Congress (the derivative source for 416(b)(4)), added section 416(b)(3) to the Federal Aviation Act. Section 29(c) added provisions that eventually were classified as 49 App.:1482a. Those provisions contained a reference to section 416(b)(3). When S. 2493 (passed in lieu of the House bill after being amended to contain much of the text of the House bill) was reported by the conference committee and enacted into law, section 32 added what had been a new 416(b)(3) as a new 416(b)(4). However, the conference committee did not make a corresponding change in the cross-reference in section 37(c), that added 49 App.:1482a. See 124 Cong. Rec. 30714, 30716, 36521, 36524. The word &ldquo;scheduled&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;pursuant to flight schedules&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the word &ldquo;passengers&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;persons&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The words &ldquo;through service by the commuter air carrier over the commuter air carrier's routes&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;transportation over its routes&rdquo; for clarity.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) In deciding whether to cancel or reject a tariff of an air carrier or foreign air carrier under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effect of the price on the movement of traffic;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the need in the public interest of adequate and efficient transportation by air carriers and foreign air carriers at the lowest cost consistent with providing the transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the standards prescribed under law related to the character and quality of transportation to be provided by air carriers and foreign air carriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the inherent advantages of transportation by aircraft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the need of the air carrier and foreign air carrier for revenue sufficient to enable the air carrier and foreign air carrier, under honest, economical, and efficient management, to provide adequate and efficient air carrier and foreign air carrier transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) whether the price will be predatory or tend to monopolize competition among air <!-- PDFPage:668 -->carriers and foreign air carriers in foreign air transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) reasonably estimated or foreseeable future costs and revenues for the air carrier or foreign air carrier for a reasonably limited future period during which the price would be in effect; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) other factors.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Suspension</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) Pending a decision under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary may suspend a tariff and the use of a price contained in the tariff or a classification, rule, or practice affecting that price.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may suspend a tariff of a foreign air carrier and the use of a price, classification, rule, or practice when the suspension is in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A suspension becomes effective when the Secretary files with the tariff and delivers to the air carrier or foreign air carrier affected by the suspension a written statement of the reasons for the suspension. To suspend a tariff, reasonable notice of the suspension must be given to the affected carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The suspension of a newly filed tariff may be for periods totaling not more than 365 days after the date the tariff otherwise would go into effect. The suspension of an existing tariff may be for periods totaling not more than 365 days after the effective date of the suspension. The Secretary may rescind at any time the suspension of a newly filed tariff and allow the price, classification, rule, or practice to go into effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Effective Tariffs and Prices When Tariff Is Suspended, Canceled, or Rejected</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If a tariff is suspended pending the outcome of a proceeding under subsection (a) of this section and the Secretary does not take final action in the proceeding during the suspension period, the tariff goes into effect at the end of that period subject to cancellation when the proceeding is concluded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) During the period of suspension, or after the cancellation or rejection, of a newly filed tariff (including a tariff that has gone into effect provisionally), the affected air carrier or foreign air carrier shall maintain in effect and use&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the corresponding seasonal prices, or the classifications, rules, and practices affecting those prices or the value of transportation provided under those prices, that were in effect for the carrier immediately before the new tariff was filed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) another price provided for under an applicable intergovernmental agreement or understanding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the suspended, canceled, or rejected tariff is the first tariff of the carrier for the covered transportation, the carrier, for the purpose of operations during the period of suspension or pending effectiveness of a new tariff, may file another tariff containing a price or another classification, rule, or practice affecting the price, or the value of the transportation provided under the price, that is in effect (and not subject to a suspension order) for any air carrier providing the same transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If an existing tariff is suspended or canceled, the affected air carrier or foreign air carrier, for the purpose of operations during the period of suspension or pending effectiveness of a new tariff, may file another tariff containing a price or another classification, rule, or practice affecting the price, or the value of the transportation provided under the price, that is in effect (and not subject to a suspension order) for any air carrier providing the same transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Response to Refusal of Foreign Country To Allow Air Carrier To Charge a Price</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the Secretary finds that the government or an aeronautical authority of a foreign country has refused to allow an air carrier to charge a price contained in a tariff filed and published under section 41504 of this title for foreign air transportation to the foreign country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary, without a hearing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may suspend any existing tariff of a foreign air carrier providing transportation between the United States and the foreign country for periods totaling not more than 365 days after the date of the suspension; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may order the foreign air carrier to charge, during the suspension periods, prices that are the same as those contained in a tariff (designated by the Secretary) of an air carrier filed and published under section 41504 of this title for foreign air transportation to the foreign country; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a foreign air carrier may continue to provide foreign air transportation to the foreign country only if the government or aeronautical authority of the foreign country allows an air carrier to start or continue foreign air transportation to the foreign country at the prices designated by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Standard Foreign Fare Level</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) In this subsection, &ldquo;standard foreign fare level&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) for a class of fares existing on October 1, 1979, the fare between 2 places (as adjusted under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph) filed for and allowed by the Civil Aeronautics Board to go into effect after September 30, 1979, and before August 13, 1980 (with seasonal fares adjusted by the percentage difference that prevailed between seasons in 1978), or the fare established under section 1002(j)(8) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85&ndash;726, 72 Stat. 731), as added by section 24(a) of the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979 (Public Law 96&ndash;192, 94 Stat. 46); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for a class of fares established after October 1, 1979, the fare between 2 places in effect on the effective date of the establishment of the new class.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) At least once every 60 days for fuel costs, and at least once every 180 days for other costs, the Secretary shall adjust the standard foreign fare level for the particular foreign air transportation to which the standard foreign fare level applies by increasing or decreasing that level by the percentage change from the last previous period in the actual operating cost for each available seat-mile. In adjusting a standard foreign fare level, the Secretary may not make an adjustment to costs actually incurred. In establishing a standard foreign fare level and making adjustments in the level under this paragraph, <!-- PDFPage:669 -->the Secretary may use all relevant or appropriate information reasonably available to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not decide that a proposed fare for foreign air transportation is unreasonable on the basis that the fare is too low or too high if the proposed fare is neither more than 5 percent higher nor 50 percent lower than the standard foreign fare level for the same or essentially similar class of transportation. The Secretary by regulation may increase the 50 percent specified in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Paragraph (2) of this subsection does not apply to a proposed fare that is not more than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 5 percent higher than the standard foreign fare level when the Secretary decides that the proposed fare may be unreasonably discriminatory or that suspension of the fare is in the public interest because of an unreasonable regulatory action by the government of a foreign country that is related to a fare proposal of an air carrier; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 50 percent lower than the standard foreign fare level when the Secretary decides that the proposed fare may be predatory or discriminatory or that suspension of the fare is required because of an unreasonable regulatory action by the government of a foreign country that is related to a fare proposal of an air carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Submission of Orders to President</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall submit to the President an order made under this section suspending, canceling, or rejecting a price for foreign air transportation, and an order rescinding the effectiveness of such an order, before publishing the order. Not later than 10 days after its submission, the President may disapprove the order on finding disapproval is necessary for United States foreign policy or national defense reasons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Compliance as Condition of Certificate or Permit</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section and compliance with an order of the Secretary under this section are conditions to any certificate or permit held by an air carrier or foreign air carrier. An air carrier or foreign air carrier may provide foreign air transportation only as long as the carrier maintains prices for that transportation that comply with this section and orders of the Secretary under this section.</p>
