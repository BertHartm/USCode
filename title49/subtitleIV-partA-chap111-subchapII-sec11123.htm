<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) direct the handling, routing, and movement of the traffic of a rail carrier and its distribution over its own or other railroad lines;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) require joint or common use of railroad facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) prescribe temporary through routes; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Except with respect to proceedings under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Board may act under this section on its own initiative or on application without regard to subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Rail carriers may establish between themselves the terms of compensation for operations, and use of facilities and equipment, required under this section.

The Board may act under subsection (a) before conducting a proceeding under this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Board may extend any action taken under subsection (a) of this section beyond 30 days if the Board finds that a transportation emergency described in subsection (a) continues to exist. Action by the Board under subsection (a) of this section may not remain in effect for more than 240 days beyond the initial 30-day period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) In carrying out this section, the Board shall require, to the maximum extent practicable, the use of employees who would normally have performed work in connection with the traffic subject to the action of the Board.</p>
