<p class="note-body">Throughout the chapter, the words &ldquo;Secretary of Transportation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Interstate Commerce Commission&rdquo; because 49:1655(e)(6)(B)&ndash;(D) transferred the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission under the provisions restated in this chapter to the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is included to maintain the jurisdictional scope of the source provisions from which subsections (b) and (c) of the revised section are taken. Subsections (b) and (c) are based on 49:304 which, as part of 49:ch. 8, is now restated as subchapter II of chapter 105 of the revised title. In addition, 49:303(a)(11) (last sentence) extended the jurisdictional scope of 49:304 as provided in subsection (a) of the revised section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;and to that end&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The word &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;establish&rdquo; for consistency. The word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;as provided in this chapter&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The term &ldquo;motor carrier&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;common carriers by motor vehicle&rdquo; and &ldquo;contract carriers by motor vehicle&rdquo; because they are inclusive.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;when needed&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;if need therefor is found&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:439 --><p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the word &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;establish&rdquo; for consistency. The word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;for a total distance of&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The words &ldquo;at least&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;more than&rdquo; for consistency. The word &ldquo;line&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;possession of the United States&rdquo; are added for consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;a foreign country&rdquo; and &ldquo;the District of Columbia&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because a carrier crossing the boundary of a foreign country or the District of Columbia into or from the United States would necessarily cross the boundary of a State and be covered by the provision related to a State.</p>
