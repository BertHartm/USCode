A gate constructed, improved, or repaired under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may not be leased for more than 10 years; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is not subject to majority in interest clauses.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Parking Lots, Fuel Farms, Utilities, Hangars, and Air Cargo Terminals.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Construction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;From amounts the Secretary distributes to an airport under section 47115, $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2004 and 2005, and $7,000,000 for each fiscal year thereafter, is available to the sponsor of a current or former military airport the Secretary designates under this section to construct, improve, or repair airport surface parking lots, fuel farms, utilities, and hangars and air cargo terminals of an area that is 50,000 square feet or less.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Designation of General Aviation Airport</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, one of the airports bearing a designation under subsection (a) may be a general aviation airport that was a former military installation closed or realigned under a section referred to in subsection (a)(1).</p>
