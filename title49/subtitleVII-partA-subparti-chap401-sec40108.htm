<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Operate</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may operate schools to train officers and employees of the Administration to carry out duties, powers, and activities of the Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Attendance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may authorize officers and employees of other departments, agencies, or instrumentalities of the United States Government, officers and employees of governments of foreign countries, and individuals from the aeronautics industry to attend those schools. However, if the attendance of any of those officers, employees, or individuals increases the cost of operating the schools, the Administrator may require the payment or transfer of amounts or other consideration to offset the additional cost. The amount received may be credited to the appropriation current when the expenditures are or were paid, the appropriation current when the amount is received, or both.</p>

<p class="note-body">In this section, the word &ldquo;Administrator&rdquo; in section 313(d) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85&ndash;726, 72 Stat. 753) is retained on authority of 49:106(g). The words &ldquo;school or&rdquo; are omitted because of 1:1.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;officers and&rdquo; are added for clarity and consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words &ldquo;to carry out duties, powers, and activities of the Administrator&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;in those subjects necessary for the proper performance of all authorized functions of the Administration&rdquo; for clarity and consistency in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;officers and employees&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;personnel&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;departments, agencies, or instrumentalities of the United States Government&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;governmental&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;governments of foreign countries&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;foreign governments&rdquo;, for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code. The words &ldquo;courses given in&rdquo;, &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo;, and &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The text of 49 App.:1354(d) (3d sentence) is omitted as unnecessary because chapter 41 of title 5, United States Code, applies to all training of employees. The words &ldquo;or both&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;(3) in part as provided under clause (1) and in part as provided under clause (2)&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
