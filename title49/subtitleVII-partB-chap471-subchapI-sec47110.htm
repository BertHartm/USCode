<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to the extent the cost is reasonable in amount;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) if the cost is not incurred in a project for airport development or airport planning for which other Government assistance has been granted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) if the total costs allowed for the project are not more than the amount stated in the grant agreement as the maximum the Government will pay (except as provided in section 47108(b) of this title); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) if the cost is for a project not described in section 47102(3) for acquiring for use at a commercial service airport vehicles and ground support equipment owned by an airport that include low-emission technology, but only to the extent of the incremental cost of equipping such vehicles or equipment with low-emission technology, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Certain Prior Costs as Allowable Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may decide that a project cost under subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section incurred after May 13, 1946, and before the date the grant agreement is executed is allowable if it is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) necessarily incurred in formulating an airport development project, including costs incurred for field surveys, plans and specifications, property interests in land or airspace, and administration or other incidental items that would not have been incurred except for the project; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Letters of Intent</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may issue a letter of intent to the sponsor stating an intention to obligate from future budget authority an amount, not more than the Government's share of allowable project costs, for an airport development project (including costs of formulating the project) at a primary or reliever airport. The letter shall establish a schedule under which the Secretary will reimburse the sponsor for the Government's share of allowable project costs, as amounts become available, if the sponsor, after the Secretary issues the letter, carries out the project without receiving amounts under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection applies to a project&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1038 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) about which the sponsor notifies the Secretary, before the project begins, of the sponsor's intent to carry out the project;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that meets the criteria of section 47115(d) and, if for a project at a commercial service airport having at least 0.25 percent of the boardings each year at all such airports, the Secretary decides will enhance system-wide airport capacity significantly.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A letter of intent issued under paragraph (1) of this subsection is not an obligation of the Government under section 1501 of title 31, and the letter is not deemed to be an administrative commitment for financing. An obligation or administrative commitment may be made only as amounts are provided in authorization and appropriation laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The total estimated amount of future Government obligations covered by all outstanding letters of intent under paragraph (1) of this subsection may not be more than the amount authorized to carry out section 48103 of this title, less an amount reasonably estimated by the Secretary to be needed for grants under section 48103 that are not covered by a letter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <cap-smallcap>Letters of intent</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not require an eligible agency to impose a passenger facility fee under section 40117 in order to obtain a letter of intent under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on statutory construction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the obligation of amounts pursuant to a letter of intent under this subsection in the same fiscal year as the letter of intent is issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Nonallowable Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section and section 47118(f) of this title, a cost is not an allowable airport development project cost if it is for&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) providing or installing sculpture or art works.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Use of Discretionary Funds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A project for which cost reimbursement is provided under subsection (b)(2)(C) shall not receive priority consideration with respect to the use of discretionary funds made available under section 47115 of this title even if the amounts made available under paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 47114(c) or section 47114(d)(3)(A) are not sufficient to cover the Government's share of the cost of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Nonprimary Airports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may decide that the costs of revenue producing aeronautical support facilities, including fuel farms and hangars, are allowable for an airport development project at a nonprimary airport if the Government's share of such costs is paid only with funds apportioned to the airport sponsor under section 47114(d)(3)(A) and if the Secretary determines that the sponsor has made adequate provision for financing airside needs of the airport.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) The Under Secretary of Transportation for Security may issue a letter of intent to an airport committing to obligate from future budget authority an amount, not more than the Federal Government's share of the project's cost, for an airport security improvement project (including interest costs and costs of formulating the project) at the airport. The letter shall establish a schedule under which the Under Secretary will reimburse the airport for the Government's share of the project's costs, as amounts become available, if the airport, after the Under Secretary issues the letter, carries out the project without receiving amounts under Chapter 471 of title 49 [United States Code].</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) The airport shall notify the Under Secretary of the airport's intent to carry out the airport security improvement project before the project begins.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Under Secretary determines that the project will improve security or will improve the efficiency of the airport without lessening security.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) A letter of intent issued under this section is not an obligation of the Government under section 1501 of title 31 [United States Code], and the letter is not deemed to be an administrative commitment for financing. An obligation or administrative commitment may be made only as amounts are provided in authorization and appropriations laws.</p>
