<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Program Elements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each railroad carrier required to submit a railroad safety risk reduction program under subsection (a) shall develop a comprehensive safety risk reduction program to improve safety by reducing the number and rates of accidents, incidents, injuries, and fatalities that is based on the risk analysis required by subsection (c) through&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the mitigation of aspects that increase risks to railroad safety; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the enhancement of aspects that decrease risks to railroad safety.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Required components</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each railroad carrier's safety risk reduction program shall include a risk mitigation plan in accordance with this section, a technology implementation plan that meets the requirements of subsection (e), and a fatigue management plan that meets the requirements of subsection (f).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Technology Implementation Plan.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As part of its railroad safety risk reduction program, a railroad carrier required to submit a railroad safety risk reduction program under subsection (a) shall develop, and periodically update as necessary, a 10-year technology implementation plan that describes the railroad carrier's plan for development, adoption, implementation, maintenance, and use of current, new, or novel technologies on its system over a 10-year period to reduce safety risks identified under the railroad safety risk reduction program. Any updates to the plan are subject to review and approval by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Technology analysis</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A railroad carrier's technology implementation plan shall include an analysis of the safety impact, feasibility, and cost and benefits of implementing technologies, including processor-based technologies, positive train control systems (as defined in section 20157(i)), electronically controlled pneumatic brakes, rail integrity inspection systems, rail integrity warning systems, switch position monitors and indicators, trespasser prevention technology, highway-rail grade crossing technology, and other new or novel railroad safety technology, as appropriate, that may mitigate risks to railroad safety identified in the risk analysis required by subsection (c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Implementation schedule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A railroad carrier's technology implementation plan shall contain a prioritized implementation schedule for the development, adoption, implementation, and use of current, new, or novel technologies on its system to reduce safety risks identified under the railroad safety risk reduction program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Positive train control</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as required by section 20157 (relating to the requirements for implementation of positive train control systems), the Secretary shall ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) each railroad carrier's technology implementation plan required under paragraph (1) that includes a schedule for implementation of a positive train control system complies with that schedule; and</p>
