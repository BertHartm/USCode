The words &ldquo;that violates a standard prescribed for a model year under section 32902 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;to have violated a provision of section 2007(a)(1) of this title with respect to any model year&rdquo; and &ldquo;to have violated section 2007(a)(2) of this title&rdquo; to avoid referring, as in the source, to one provision that in turn refers to another provision. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;calculated under&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;established under&rdquo; for clarity. The reference to section 32904(a)(1)(A), which is a reference to the provision under which average fuel economy for nonpassenger automobiles is calculated, is added for clarity. The reference to section 32904(a)(1)(B), which is a reference to the provision under which average fuel economy for passenger automobiles is calculated, is substituted for the reference in the source to 15:2002(a) and (c), which is a reference to the provision under which the average fuel economy standard for those automobiles is established, for clarity. The words &ldquo;in which the violation occurs&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1)(A), before clause (i), the words &ldquo;shall prescribe by regulation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall, by rule .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. substitute&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and because &ldquo;rule&rdquo; and &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; are synonymous. The words &ldquo;in accordance with the provisions of this subsection and subsection (e)&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;be less than $5.00&rdquo; are omitted as surplus because under the subsection the Secretary may only raise the amount imposed to $10, or a $5 increase. The words &ldquo;in the absence of such rule&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;increase in the penalty&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;additional amount of the civil penalty&rdquo; for clarity.
