<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Collection Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall prescribe procedures to collect the fees.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Fees prescribed under this section shall be imposed in an amount sufficient to pay for the costs of activities under this chapter.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the impact of the fees on the financial health of the railroad industry and its competitive position relative to each competing mode of transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the total cost of Government safety activities for each other competing mode of transportation, including any part of that total cost defrayed by Government user fees.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 90 days after submitting a report for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall sub<!-- PDFPage:397 -->mit to Congress recommendations for corrective legislation if the report includes a finding that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there has been an impact from the fees on the financial health of the railroad industry or its competitive position relative to each competing mode of transportation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) there is a significant difference in the burden of Government user fees on the railroad industry and other competing modes of transportation.</p>
