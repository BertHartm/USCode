<p class="note-body">In this section, the duties and powers of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development are omitted for clarity. Section 1(a)(1) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1968 (eff. June 30, 1968, 82 Stat. 1369) provided that the Secretary retained the authority to make grants under section 11 of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 (Public Law 88&ndash;365, 78 Stat. 302), as added by section 2(a)(2) of the Act of September 8, 1966 (Public Law 89&ndash;562, 80 Stat. 716) [subsequently changed to the Federal Transit Act by section 3003(a) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102&ndash;240, 105 Stat. 2087)] that primarily concerned the relationship of urban transportation systems to the planned development of urban areas or the role of transportation planning in overall urban planning. However, section 11(b) of the Federal Transit Act was amended by section 307 of the Federal Public Transportation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95&ndash;599, 92 Stat. 2745) and no longer is concerned with urban planning. Therefore, the Secretary is not involved in making grants under section 11(b).</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(3)(C), the words &ldquo;new bus models&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;new model buses&rdquo; because of the definition of &ldquo;new bus models&rdquo; in section 5302(a) of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(4), the words &ldquo;in any fiscal year&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
