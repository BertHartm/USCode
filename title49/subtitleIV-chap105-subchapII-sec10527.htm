Whenever the shipper or receiver of the property transported under such contract requires that the operator of the vehicle load or unload any part of the property onto or from the vehicle contrary to any provision of such contract, the shipper or receiver shall compensate the owner or operator of the vehicle for all costs associated with loading or unloading that part of the property. Any person who knowingly violates the preceding sentence is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation.</p>
