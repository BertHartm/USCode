When the operation of a motor carrier or broker involves not more than 3 States, the Commission shall refer the following matters to a joint board for action when an opportunity for a proceeding is required or when the Commission finds that it is desirable:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an application for a certificate, permit, or license.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a suspension, change, or revocation of a certificate, permit, or license.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an application for approval and authorization of a consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control or of an operating contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a complaint about a violation by a motor carrier or broker of a requirement established under section 10321(a), 10525, 11101(b), or 11142(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a complaint about rates of motor carriers or practices of brokers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, if the Commission is prevented by legal proceedings from referring a matter to a joint board, the Commission may determine the matter under subchapter II of this chapter.</p>

<p class="note-body">The first sentence is substituted for 49:305(a) (2d sentence) and the words &ldquo;and the Commission may, in its discretion, when operations of motor carriers or brokers conducted or proposed to be conducted involve more than three States&rdquo; for clarity since the source provision only limits the discretionary power of the Commission when the matter involves not more than 3 States and concerns one of the enumerated items. The word &ldquo;proceeding&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;hearing&rdquo; for consistency in view of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5. The words &ldquo;under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;as provided in section 17 of this title&rdquo; to conform to the restatement. The words &ldquo;<em>Provided, however,</em> That&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;section 10321(a), 10525, 11101(b), or 11142(b) of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;section 304(a) of this title&rdquo; to cite the corresponding revised sections.</p>
