<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission under this subchapter is exclusive. A carrier or corporation participating in or resulting from a transaction approved by or exempted by the Commission under this subchapter may carry out the transaction, own and operate property, and exercise control or franchises acquired through the transaction without <!-- PDFPage:342 -->the approval of a State authority. A carrier, corporation, or person participating in that approved or exempted transaction is exempt from the antitrust laws and from all other law, including State and municipal law, as necessary to let that person carry out the transaction, hold, maintain, and operate property, and exercise control or franchises acquired through the transaction. However, if a purchase and sale, a lease, or a corporate consolidation or merger is involved in the transaction, the carrier or corporation may carry out the transaction only with the assent of a majority, or the number required under applicable State law, of the votes of the holders of the capital stock of that corporation entitled to vote. The vote must occur at a regular meeting, or special meeting called for that purpose, of those stockholders and the notice of the meeting must indicate its purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A power granted under this subchapter to a carrier or corporation is in addition to and changes its powers under its corporate charter and under State law. Action under this subchapter does not establish or provide for establishing a corporation under the laws of the United States.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;11342. Limitation on pooling and division of transportation or earnings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I, II, or III of chapter 105 of this title may not agree or combine with another of those carriers to pool or divide traffic or services or any part of their earnings without the approval of the Commission under this section or sections 11124 and 11125 of this title. Except as provided in subsection (b) for agreements or combinations between or among motor common carriers of property, the Commission may approve and authorize the agreement or combination if the carriers involved assent to the pooling or division and the Commission finds that a pooling or division of traffic, services, or earnings&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) will be in the interest of better service to the public or of economy of operation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will not unreasonably restrain competition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Any motor common carrier of property may apply to the Commission for approval of an agreement or combination with another motor common carrier of property to pool or divide traffic or any services or any part of their earnings by filing such agreement or combination with the Commission not less than 50 days before its effective date. Prior to the effective date of the agreement or combination, the Commission shall determine whether the agreement or combination is of major transportation importance and whether there is substantial likelihood that the agreement or combination will unduly restrain competition. If the Commission determines that neither of these two factors exists, it shall, prior to such effective date and without a hearing, approve and authorize the agreement or combination, under such rules and regulations as the Commission may issue, and for such consideration between such carriers and upon such terms and conditions as shall be found by the Commission to be just and reasonable. If the Commission determines either that the agreement or combination is of major transportation importance or that there is a substantial likelihood that the agreement or combination will unduly restrain competition, the Commission shall hold a hearing concerning whether the agreement or combination will be in the interest of better service to the public or of economy in operation and whether it will unduly restrain competition and shall suspend operation of such agreement or combination pending such hearing and final decision thereon. After such hearing, the Commission shall indicate to what extent it finds that the agreement or combination will be in the interest of better service to the public or of economy in operation and will not unduly restrain competition and if assented <!-- PDFPage:343 -->to by all the carriers involved, shall, to that extent, approve and authorize the agreement or combination, under such rules and regulations as the Commission may issue, and for such consideration between such carriers and upon such terms and conditions as shall be found by the Commission to be just and reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of an application for Commission approval of an agreement or combination between a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods and its agents to pool or divide traffic or services or any part of their earnings, such agreement or combination shall be presumed to be in the interest of better service to the public and of economy in operation and not to restrain competition unduly if the practices proposed to be carried out under such agreement or combination are the same as or similar to practices carried out under agreements and combinations between motor common carriers providing transportation of household goods to pool or divide traffic or services or any part of their earnings approved by the Commission before the date of enactment of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall streamline, simplify, and expedite, to the maximum extent practicable, the process (including, but not limited to, any paperwork) for submission and approval of applications under this section for agreements and combinations between motor common carriers providing transportation of household goods and their agents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission may impose conditions governing the pooling or division and may approve and authorize payment of a reasonable consideration between the carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) This section affects an agreement or combination filed with the Commission before March 19, 1941, to which a water common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter III of chapter 105 of this title is a party only when the Commission determines that the agreement or combination does not meet the requirements for approval and authorization under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Commission may begin a proceeding under this section on its own initiative or on application.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;11343. Consolidation, merger, and acquisition of control</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The following transactions involving carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I (except a pipeline carrier), II, or III of chapter 105 of this title may be <!-- PDFPage:344 -->carried out only with the approval and authorization of the Commission:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consolidation or merger of the properties or franchises of at least 2 carriers into one corporation for the ownership, management, and operation of the previously separately owned properties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a purchase, lease, or contract to operate property of another carrier by any number of carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) acquisition of control of a carrier by any number of carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) acquisition of control of at least 2 carriers by a person that is not a carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) acquisition of control of a carrier by a person that is not a carrier but that controls any number of carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) acquisition by a rail carrier of trackage rights over, or joint ownership in or joint use of, a railroad line (and terminals incidental to it) owned or operated by another rail carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A person may carry out a transaction referred to in subsection (a) of this section or participate in achieving the control or management, including the power to exercise control or management, in a common interest of more than one of those carriers, regardless of how that result is reached, only with the approval and authorization of the Commission under this subchapter. In addition to other transactions, each of the following transactions are considered achievements of control or management:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A transaction by a carrier has the effect of putting that carrier and persons affiliated with it, taken together, in control of another carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A transaction by a person affiliated with a carrier has the effect of putting that carrier and persons affiliated with it, taken together, in control of another carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A transaction by at least 2 persons acting together (one of whom is a carrier or is affiliated with a carrier) has the effect of putting those persons and carriers and persons affiliated with any of them, or with any of those affiliated carriers, taken together, in control of another carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A person is affiliated with a carrier under this subchapter if, because of the relationship between that person and a carrier, it is reasonable to believe that the affairs of another carrier, control of which may be acquired by that person, will be managed in the interest of the other carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Approval and authorization by the Commission are not required if the only parties to a transaction referred to in subsection (a) of this section are motor carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title and the aggregate gross operating revenues of those carriers were not more than $2,000,000 during a period of 12 consecutive months ending not more than 6 months before the date of the agreement of the parties covering the transaction. However, the approval and authorization of the Commission is required when a motor carrier that is controlled by or affiliated with a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of that chapter is a party to the transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The approval and authorization of the Commission are not required if the only parties to a transaction referred to in subsection (a) of this section are street, suburban, or interurban electric railways that are not controlled by or under common control with a carrier that is operated as part of a general railroad system of transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Notwithstanding any provisions of this title, the Interstate Commerce Commission, in a matter related to a motor carrier of property providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title, may exempt a person, class of persons, transaction, or class of transactions from the merger, consolidation, and acquisition of control provisions of this subchapter if the Commission finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the application of such provisions is not necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) either (i) the transaction is of limited scope, or (ii) the application of such provisions is not needed to protect shippers from the abuse of market power.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) At least 60 days before any transaction exempt under this subsection from the merger, consolidation, and acquisition of control provisions of this subchapter may take effect, each carrier intending to participate in such transaction shall file with the Commission a notice of its intention to participate in such transaction and shall give public notice of such intention. The Commission shall prescribe the information to be contained in such notices, including the nature and scope of the transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission, on its own initiative or on complaint, may revoke an exemption granted under this subsection, to the extent it specifies, when it finds that application of the provisions of this section to the person, class of persons, or transportation is necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Commission, on its own initiative, finds that employees of any carrier intending to participate in a transaction exempt under this subsection from the merger, consolidation, and acquisition of control provisions of this subchapter are or will be adversely affected by such transaction or if employees of such carrier adversely affected by such transaction file a complaint concerning such transaction with the Commission, the Commission shall revoke such exemption to the extent the Commission deems necessary to review and address the adverse effects on such employees.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission may begin a proceeding to approve and authorize a transaction referred to in section 11343 of this title on application of the person seeking that authority. When an application is filed with the Commission, the Commission shall notify the chief executive officer of each State in which property of the carriers involved in the proposed transaction is located and shall notify those carriers. If a motor carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title is involved in the transaction, the Commission must notify the persons specified in section 10328(b) of this title. The Commission shall hold a public hearing when a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of that chapter is involved in the transaction unless the Commission determines that a public hearing is not necessary in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In a proceeding under this section which involves the merger or control of at least two class I railroads, as defined by the Commission, the Commission shall consider at least the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effect of the proposed transaction on the adequacy of transportation to the public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the effect on the public interest of including, or failing to include, other rail carriers in the area involved in the proposed transaction.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:346 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the total fixed charges that result from the proposed transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the interest of carrier employees affected by the proposed transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) whether the proposed transaction would have an adverse effect on competition among rail carriers in the affected region.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In a proceeding under this section which involves only carriers of passengers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title, the Commission shall consider at least the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effect of the proposed transaction on the adequacy of transportation to the public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the effect on the public interest of including, or failing to include, other rail carriers in the area involved in the proposed transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the total fixed charges that result from the proposed transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the interest of carrier employees affected by the proposed transaction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission shall approve and authorize a transaction under this section when it finds the transaction is consistent with the public interest. The Commission may impose conditions governing the transaction. When the transaction contemplates a guaranty or assumption of payment of dividends or of fixed charges or will result in an increase of total fixed charges, the Commission may approve and authorize the transaction only if it finds that the guaranty, assumption, or increase is consistent with the public interest. When a rail carrier, or a person controlled by or affiliated with a rail carrier, is an applicant and the transaction involves a motor carrier, the Commission may approve and authorize the transaction only if it finds that the transaction is consistent with the public interest, will enable the rail carrier to use motor carrier transportation to public advantage in its operations, and will not unreasonably restrain competition. When a rail carrier is involved in the transaction, the Commission may require inclusion of other rail carriers located in the area involved in the transaction if they apply for inclusion and the Commission finds their inclusion to be consistent with the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In a proceeding under this section which does not involve the merger or control of at least two class I railroads, as defined by the Commission, the Commission shall approve such an application unless it finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) as a result of the transaction, there is likely to be substantial lessening of competition, creation of a monopoly, or restraint of trade in freight surface transportation in any region of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the anticompetitive effects of the transaction outweigh the public interest in meeting significant transportation needs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In making such findings, the Commission shall, with respect to any application that is part of a plan or proposal developed under section 333(a)&ndash;(d) of this title, accord substantial weight to any recommendations of the Secretary of Transportation. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to any proceeding under this section which involves only carriers of passengers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A rail carrier, or a person controlled by or affiliated with a rail carrier, together with one or more affected shippers, may apply for approval under this subsection of a transaction for the purpose of providing motor carrier transportation prior or subsequent to rail transportation to serve inadequately served shippers located on a railroad other than the applicant carrier. Such application shall be approved by the Commission if the applicants demonstrate presently impaired rail service and inadequate motor common carrier service which results in the serious failure of the rail carrier serving the shippers to meet the rail equipment or transportation schedules of shippers or seriously to fail otherwise to provide adequate normal rail services required by shippers and which shippers would reasonably expect the rail carrier to provide. The Commission shall approve or disapprove applications under this subsection within 30 days after receipt of such application. The Commission shall approve applications which are not protested by interested parties within 30 days following receipt of such application.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title or the Secretary of Transportation may apply, before January 1, 1982, for authority for and approval of a merger, consolidation, unification or coordination project (as described in section 333(c) of this title), joint use of tracks or other facilities, or acquisition or sale of assets involving one of those rail carriers, under this section instead of sections 11344 <!-- PDFPage:350 -->and 11345 of this title. The Secretary may apply under this section only when the parties to the application that are rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of that chapter consent to an application by the Secretary. A rail carrier may apply under this section only if it sent the proposed transaction to the Secretary for a report under section 11350 of this title at least 6 months before applying under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When the Commission notifies persons required to receive notice that an application has been filed under this section, the Commission must include in the notice a copy of the application, a summary of the proposed transaction, and the applicant's reasons and public interest justification for the transaction. When the Commission notifies the Secretary of Transportation that an application has been filed under this section, the Commission shall also request the report of the Secretary prepared under section 11350 of this title. By the 10th day after receiving an application under this section, the Commission shall send notice of the proposed transaction to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Secretary of Labor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the Secretary of Transportation (unless the Secretary is the applicant under subsection (a) of this section).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission shall designate a panel of the Commission to make a recommended decision on each application under this section. The panel must begin a proceeding by the 90th day after the date the Commission receives the application, complete the proceeding by the 180th day after the application is referred to it, and give its recommended decision and certify the record to the entire Commission by the 90th day after the proceeding is completed. The panel may use employees appointed under section 3105 of title 5 and the Rail Services Planning Office in conducting the proceeding, evaluating the application and comments received about it, and determining whether it is in the public interest to approve and authorize the transaction under the last sentence of subsection (d) of this section. To carry out this subsection, the panel may make rules and rulings to avoid unnecessary costs and delay. In making its recommended decision, the panel shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) request the views of the Secretary of Transportation about the effect of the transaction on the national transportation policy, as stated by the Secretary, and consider the report submitted under section 11350 of this title;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) request the views of the Secretary of Labor about the effect of the transaction on rail carrier employees, particularly whether the proposal contains adequate employee protection provisions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretaries and the Attorney General shall send their written views to the panel. Those statements are available to the public under section 552(a) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When the recommended decision and record of a proceeding under this section are certified to the entire Commission, it must hear oral argument on the matter certified to it and make a final decision by the 120th day after receiving the recommended decision and record. The Commission may extend a time period under subsection (c) of this section or under this subsection but must make its final decision by the end of the 2d year after receipt of the application by the Commission. The Commission shall consider the report of the Secretary of Transportation under section 11350 of this title in making its final decision. The final decision must be accompanied by a written opinion stating the reasons for the Commission action. The Commission may&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->

<p class="statutory-body">When a rail carrier is involved in a transaction for which approval is sought under sections 11344 and 11345 or section 11346 of this title, the Interstate Commerce Commission shall require the carrier to provide a fair arrangement at least as protective of the interests of employees who are affected by the transaction as the terms imposed under this section before February 5, 1976, and the terms established under sections 24307(c), 24312, and 24706(c) of this title. Notwithstanding this subtitle, the arrangement may be made by the rail carrier and the authorized representative of its employees. The arrangement and the order approving the transaction must require that the employees of the affected rail carrier will not be in a worse position related to their employment as a result of the transaction during the 4 years following the effective date of the final action of the Commission (or if an employee was employed for a lesser period of time by the carrier before the action became effective, for that lesser period).</p>
