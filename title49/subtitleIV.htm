<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>Clarification of use of &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; and &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo;</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Throughout the bill, the term &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;just and reasonable&rdquo; and &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;preference&rdquo;, &ldquo;prejudice&rdquo;, &ldquo;advantage&rdquo;, and &ldquo;disadvantage&rdquo; for clarity, consistency, and to conform to modern usage. See <em>Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Co. v. Harriman,</em> 227 U.S. 657, 1913; <em>United States v. P. Koenig Coal Co.,</em> 270 U.S. 512, 1926; <em>Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co.,</em> 284 U.S. 370, 1932; <em>Union Pacific R. Co. v. United States,</em> 313 U.S. 450, 1941; <em>Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co.,</em> 315 U.S. 575, 1942; <em>Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co.,</em> 320 U.S. 591, 1944; <em>United States ex rel. Morris v. Delaware, L. & W.R. Co.,</em> 40 F. 101, Cir. Ct. N.Y., 1889. The change does not affect the substantive law. The words for which the substitutions are made are used inconsistently throughout the Interstate Commerce Act and related laws and are often used in series with other synonymous words. As the editors of the U.S. Code Service point out in an explanatory note to section 2 of title 49:</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>Explanatory note.</em>&mdash;In using the annotations following, it must be borne in mind that the words &ldquo;unjust discrimination&rdquo; [the term employed in this section] and &ldquo;preference and prejudice&rdquo; [the terms employed in &sect;3(1) of this title] have been used in innumerable instances by the courts and by the commission as interchangeable. The Elkins Act [&sect;&sect;41&ndash;43 of this title] employs the word &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; without the qualifying adjective &ldquo;unjust.&rdquo; It is impossible in the great majority of cases to determine from the opinions whether this section, or &sect;3(1) of this title, or the Elkins Act [&sect;&sect;41&ndash;43 of this title] was the basis of the decision, because of the use of the terms interchangeably, or the use of &ldquo;unjust discrimination&rdquo; as covering violations of &sect;3(1) of this title, or the omission to specify the particular provision of law under immediate consideration, or because both this section and &sect;3(1) of this title, may have been pleaded and referred to as the basis of the decision. There is some similar confusion in the cases between this section and the provisions of &sect;1(5) of this title, requiring all rates to be just and reasonable, and &sect;1(6) of this title, requiring just and reasonable classifications, and transportation regulations and practices.</p>
<p class="note-body">While the amendments made to the Interstate Commerce Act by Public Law 94&ndash;210 continued the use of the multiple synonyms, that continuation is not significant since those amendments did not restate the entire act. Should a question ever arise concerning this change, section 3 of the bill would require the legal conclusion that no change in substance was intended. The following table identifies those sections of the Interstate Commerce Act that use the terms discussed in this note.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10101a. Rail transportation policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">In regulating the railroad industry, it is the policy of the United States Government&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to allow, to the maximum extent possible, competition and the demand for services to establish reasonable rates for transportation by rail;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to minimize the need for Federal regulatory control over the rail transportation system and to require fair and expeditious regulatory decisions when regulation is required;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to promote a safe and efficient rail transportation system by allowing rail carriers to earn adequate revenues, as determined by the Interstate Commerce Commission;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to ensure the development and continuation of a sound rail transportation system with effective competition among rail carriers and with other modes, to meet the needs of the public and the national defense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to foster sound economic conditions in transportation and to ensure effective competition and coordination between rail carriers and other modes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to maintain reasonable rates where there is an absence of effective competition and where rail rates provide revenues which exceed the amount necessary to maintain the rail system and to attract capital;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to reduce regulatory barriers to entry into and exit from the industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) to operate transportation facilities and equipment without detriment to the public health and safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) to cooperate with the States on transportation matters to assure that intrastate regulatory jurisdiction is exercised in accordance with the standards established in this subtitle;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) to encourage honest and efficient management of railroads and, in particular, the elimination of noncompensatory rates for rail transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) to require rail carriers, to the maximum extent practicable, to rely on individual rate increases, and to limit the use of increases of general applicability;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) to encourage fair wages and safe and suitable working conditions in the railroad industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) to prohibit predatory pricing and practices, to avoid undue concentrations of market power and to prohibit unlawful discrimination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) to ensure the availability of accurate cost information in regulatory proceedings, while minimizing the burden on rail carriers of developing and maintaining the capability of providing such information; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) to encourage and promote energy conservation.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Declaration of Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 2 of Pub. L. 96&ndash;448 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress hereby finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) historically, railroads were the essential factor in the national transportation system;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act [Feb. 4, 1887, ch. 104, 24 Stat. 379, which was repealed and is covered by this subtitle] was essential to prevent an abuse of monopoly power by railroads and to establish and maintain a national railroad network;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) today, most transportation within the United States is competitive;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) many of the Government regulations affecting railroads have become unnecessary and inefficient;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) nearly two-thirds of the Nation's intercity freight is transported by modes of transportation other than railroads;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) earnings by the railroad industry are the lowest of any transportation mode and are insufficient to generate funds for necessary capital improvements;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) by 1985, there will be a capital shortfall within the railroad industry of between $16,000,000,000 and $20,000,000,000;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) failure to achieve increased earnings within the railroad industry will result in either further deterioration of the rail system or the necessity for additional Federal subsidy; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) modernization of economic regulation for the railroad industry with a greater reliance on the marketplace is essential in order to achieve maximum utilization of railroads to save energy and combat inflation.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Statement of Purpose and Goals</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 3 of Pub. L. 96&ndash;448 provided that: &ldquo;The purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 1980 Amendment note set out under section 10101 of this title] is to provide for the restoration, maintenance, and improvement of the physical facilities and financial stability of the rail system of the United States. In order to achieve this purpose, it is hereby declared that the goals of this Act are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to assist the railroads of the Nation in rehabilitating the rail system in order to meet the demands of interstate commerce and the national defense;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to reform Federal regulatory policy so as to preserve a safe, adequate, economical, efficient, and financially stable rail system;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to assist the rail system to remain viable in the private sector of the economy;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to provide a regulatory process that balances the needs of carriers, shippers, and the public; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to assist in the rehabilitation and financing of the rail system.&rdquo;</p>

However, the Commission may not delegate a matter required to be referred to a joint board under section 10341 of this title, or a function vested in the Commission under this chapter. The Commission may change or rescind a delegation under this subsection at any time. When a Commissioner or employee cannot act on a matter delegated under this section because of absence or another reason, the Chairman of the Commission may designate another Commissioner or employee, as the case may be, to serve temporarily until the Commission otherwise orders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Delegation to a division of a matter related to the validity of rates shall be made according to the character of regulation exercised. The delegation of any such matter may not be made according to the kind or class of carrier involved or to the form or mode of transportation in which that carrier may be engaged.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A division, individual Commissioner, employee board, or an employee may act on a matter delegated under subsection (a) of this section. When acting under this section, a division, individual Commissioner, board, or an employee has the same power and authority and is subject to the same duties and obligations as the Commission. Action taken under this section has the same force and is taken in the same manner as if taken by the Commission.</p>

The deadlines set forth in this section do not apply to the following sections of this title: 10525(c), 10530, 10708(b), 10708(f), 10922(i)(2),<sup><a href="#10322_1_target" name="10322_1">1</a></sup> 10922(i)(4),<sup><a href="#10322_1_target" name="10322_1">1</a></sup> 10928, 10934(c), 10935, 11345a, and 11701(c). In addition, the deadlines set forth in this section do not apply to any application filed under section 10922(c)(2)(A)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10322_1_target" name="10322_1">1</a></sup> of this title for authority to provide regular-route transportation entirely in one State as a motor common carrier of passengers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a division, individual commissioner, employee board, or an employee delegated under section 10305 of this title to make an initial decision in a matter related to a carrier (other than a rail carrier), or, in the case of a matter referred to a joint board under section 10341 of this title, such joint board&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall, in any case in which an oral hearing is held or the Commission has found that an issue of general transportation importance is involved, complete all evidentiary proceedings related to the matter not later than the 180th day following institution of the proceeding and shall issue in writing the initial decision not later than the 270th day following institution of the proceeding; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall, in the case of all other proceedings subject to this section, issue in writing the initial decision by the 180th day following institution of the proceeding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If evidence is submitted in writing or testimony is taken at an oral hearing, the initial decision shall include specific findings of fact, specific and separate conclusions of law, an order, and justification for the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case involving an application for authority to provide motor carrier transportation incidental to trailer-on-flatcar or container-on-flatcar service by rail under subchapter II of chapter 109 of this subtitle, a final decision on such application shall be issued in writing not later than the 180th day following the date such application is filed with the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) At the earliest practicable time after the filing of an application for authority under subchapter II of chapter 109 of this title, the Commission shall publish notice of the filing of such application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission, or a division designated by the Commission, may waive the requirement for an initial decision under subsection (b) of this section and may require the matter to be considered by the Commission or such division on finding that the matter involves a question of Commission policy, a new or novel issue of law, or an issue of general transportation importance or that waiver of the initial decision is required for the timely execution of the Commission's functions. If the requirement for an initial decision is waived, a final decision shall be issued in writing within the time limit established for the issuance of the initial decision under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In a proceeding under this section in which the parties have had at least an opportunity to submit evidence in written form, such parties shall have an opportunity to present arguments to the initial decisionmaker. The decisionmaker shall determine whether the arguments should be presented orally or in writing and may require that written arguments be submitted simultaneously with written submissions of evidence and that oral arguments be presented at an oral hearing. Upon issuance of an initial decision under this section, copies of such decision shall be served on the parties and submitted to the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) An initial decision under this section becomes a final decision on the 20th day after it is served on the interested parties, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an interested party files an appeal during the 20-day period or, if authorized by the Commission or division designated by the Commission, by the end of an additional period of not more than 20 days; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Before an initial decision under this section becomes a final decision, the Commission or a division or an employee board designated by the Commission, may review the initial decision on its own initiative and shall review an initial decision if a timely appeal is filed under subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An initial decision may be reviewed on the record on which it is based or by a further hearing. If an initial decision is reviewed, it shall be stayed pending final determination of the matter and it becomes a final decision only after the final determination is made. If a timely appeal is filed under subsection (e) of this section, the final determination shall be made not later than the 50th day after the appeal is filed. If an initial decision under this section is reviewed by the Commission or a division or an employee board designated by the Commission on its own initiative, the final decision shall be made not later than the 50th day after initiation of such review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, if an initial decision under this section is reviewed by further hearing, such review shall be completed, and a final decision made, not later than the 120th day following the date the further hearing is granted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Review of, or appeal from, an initial decision under this section shall be conducted under section 557 of title 5. The Commission may prescribe rules limiting and defining the issues and pleadings on review under subsection (b) of such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) The Commission may, at any time on its own initiative because of material error, new evidence, or substantially changed circumstances&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reopen a proceeding;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:182 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) grant rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration of an action of the Commission; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) change an action of the Commission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">An interested party may petition to reopen and reconsider an action of the Commission under this paragraph under regulations of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may grant a rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration of an action of the Commission that was taken by a division or an employee board designated by the Commission if it finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the action involved a matter of general transportation importance; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the action would be affected materially because of clear and convincing new evidence or changed circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">An interested party may petition for rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration of an action of the Commission under this paragraph under regulations of the Commission. The Commission may stay an action pending a final determination under this paragraph. The Commission shall complete reconsideration and take final action by the 120th day after the petition is granted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Commission initiates any action under paragraph (1) of this subsection, final disposition under such paragraph shall be made not later than the 120th day following the date action is initiated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) A final decision under this section shall be effective on the date it is served on the parties, and a civil action to enforce, enjoin, suspend, or set aside the decision may be filed after that date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) In extraordinary circumstances, the Commission may extend a time period established by this section, except that the total of all such extensions with respect to any matter subject to the provisions of this section shall not exceed 90 days.</p>

Finally, the words &ldquo;those sections&rdquo; [in section 2 of the bill] were inadvertently substituted for the words &ldquo;that section&rdquo;.

A civil action under this subsection must be filed by the 60th day after the date of the denial or by the 60th day after the end of the 120-day period, whichever is appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The court of appeals shall order the Commission to begin the action requested in the petition to the Commission if the court finds that the action requested in that petition is necessary and failure to take that action will result in the continuation of practices that are not consistent with the public interest or are not in accordance with this subtitle. The finding of the court must be based on a preponderance of the evidence in the record before the Commission or its delegate, or, if the civil action is based on a petition on which action was not taken, in a new proceeding before the court. The court may not require the Commission to take action under this subtitle other than to begin a rulemaking proceeding.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10327. Commission action and appellate procedure in rail carrier proceedings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) This section applies to a matter before the Interstate Commerce Commission involving a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title. However, other sections of this subtitle related to action of the Commission in proceedings involving rail carriers supersede this section to the extent that they are inconsistent with the provisions of this section related to deadlines.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A division, individual Commissioner, employee board, or employee delegated under section 10305 of this title to make an initial decision in a matter related to one of those rail carriers shall complete all evidentiary proceedings related to the matter by the 180th day after assignment of the matter. The initial decision shall be submitted to the Commission in writing. If evidence is submitted in writing or testimony is taken at a public hearing, the initial decision shall be submitted to the Commission in writing by the 120th day after completion of all evidentiary proceedings and shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) specific findings of fact;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) specific and separate conclusions of law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an order; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) justification of the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission, or a division designated by the Commission, may void the requirement of an initial decision under subsection (b) of this section and may require the matter to be considered by the Commission or that division on finding that the matter involves a question of Commission policy, a new or novel issue of law, or an issue of general transportation importance, or that it is required for the timely execution of its functions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In a proceeding under this section, after the parties have had at least an opportunity to submit evidence in written form, the Commission shall give them an opportunity for briefs, written statements, or conferences of the parties. A conference of the parties must be chaired by a division, an individual Commissioner, an employee board, an employee delegated to act under section 10305 of this title, or an employee designated by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Copies of an initial decision under subsection (b) of this section shall be served on the interested parties. An initial decision becomes an action of the Commission on the 20th day after it is served on the interested parties, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an interested party files an appeal during the 20-day period, or by the end of an additional period of not more than 20 days, if authorized by the Commission or division designated by the Commission; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Commission stays or postpones the initial decision under subsection (g)(2) or (j) of this section within the period or additional period referred to in clause (1) of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Before an initial decision becomes an action of the Commission, the Commission, or a division or board designated by the Commission, may review the initial decision on its own initiative, and shall review an initial decision if an appeal is filed under subsection (e)(1) of this section. However, a board may not decide an appeal from an initial decision if the appeal may be further appealed to the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An initial decision may be reviewed on the record on which it is based or by a further hearing. If an initial decision is reviewed, it shall be stayed pending final determination of the matter, and it is an action of the Commission only after the final determination is made. If an appeal is filed under subsection (e)(1) of this section, the final determination shall be made by the 180th day after the appeal is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Review of, or appeal from, an initial decision shall be conducted under section 557 of title 5. The Commission may prescribe rules limiting and defining the issues and pleadings on review under section 557(b) of that title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) The Commission may, at any time on its own initiative because of material error, new evidence, or substantially changed circumstances&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reopen a proceeding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) grant rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration of an action of the Commission; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:185 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) change an action of the Commission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">An interested party may petition to reopen and reconsider an action of the Commission under this paragraph under regulations of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may grant a rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration of an action of the Commission that was taken by a division designated by the Commission if it finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the action involves a matter of general transportation importance; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the action would be affected materially because of clear and convincing new evidence or changed circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">An interested party may petition for rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration of an action of the Commission under this paragraph under regulations of the Commission. The Commission may stay an action pending a final determination under this paragraph. The Commission shall complete reconsideration and take final action by the 120th day after the petition is granted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) An action of the Commission under this section and an action of a designated division under subsection (c) of this section is effective on the 30th day after service on the parties to the proceeding unless the Commission provides for it to become effective on an earlier date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Notwithstanding this subtitle, an action of the Commission under this section and an action of a designated division under subsection (c) of this section is final on the date on which it is served, and a civil action to enforce, enjoin, suspend, or set aside the action may be filed after that date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) The Commission may extend a time period established by this section for a period of not more than 90 days. The extension shall be granted if a majority of the Commissioners agree to it by public vote.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) If an extension granted under subsection (j) of this section is not sufficient to allow for completion of necessary proceedings, the Commission may grant a further extension in an extraordinary situation if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a majority of the Commissioners agree to the further extension by public vote; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) not later than the 15th day before expiration of the extension granted under subsection (j) of this section, the Commission submits a written report to the Congress that a further extension has been granted. The report shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a full explanation of the reasons for the further extension;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the anticipated duration of the further extension;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the issues involved in the matter before the Commission; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the names of personnel of the Commission working on the matter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A motor carrier, a broker, a water carrier, or a household goods freight forwarder providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II, III, or IV of chapter 105 of this title shall designate an agent by name and post office address on whom service of notices in a proceeding before, and of actions of, the Commission may be made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A designation under subsection (a) of this section shall be in writing and filed with the Commission. A motor carrier or broker providing transportation under a certificate or permit issued under this subtitle shall also file the designation with the authority of each State in which it operates having jurisdiction to regulate transportation by motor vehicle in intrastate commerce on the highways of that State. The designation may be changed at any time in the same manner as originally made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Except as otherwise provided, notices of the Commission shall be served as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A notice of the Commission to a rail, express, sleeping car, or pipeline carrier is served on its designated agent at the office or usual place of residence in the District of Columbia of that agent. A notice of action of the Commission shall be served immediately on the agent or in another manner provided by law. If that carrier does not have a designated agent, service may be made by posting the notice in the office of the Secretary of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A notice to a motor carrier or broker is served personally or by mail on the motor carrier or broker or its designated agent. Service by mail on the designated agent is made at the address filed for the agent. When notice is given by mail, the date of mailing is considered to be the time when the notice is served. If a motor carrier or broker does not have a designated agent, service may be made by posting a copy of the notice in the office of the secretary or clerk of the authority having jurisdiction to regulate transportation by motor vehicle in intrastate commerce on the highways of the State in which the carrier or broker maintains headquarters and in the office of the Secretary of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A notice to a water carrier or household goods freight forwarder is served personally or <!-- PDFPage:187 -->by mail on the water carrier or household goods freight forwarder or its designated agent.

<p class="statutory-body">(d) In a proceeding involving the lawfulness of classifications, rates, or practices of (1) a rail, express, sleeping car, or pipeline carrier that has not designated an agent under this section, or (2) a household goods freight forwarder, service of notice of the Commission on an attorney in fact who filed the tariff for the carrier constitutes service of notice on the carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) In a proceeding involving the lawfulness of classifications, rates, or practices&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) service of notice of the suspension of a tariff on an attorney in fact of a carrier or broker, except a freight forwarder, constitutes service of notice on the carrier or broker if that attorney filed the tariff and, if the carrier is a water carrier, the notice specifies the classifications, rates, or practices involved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) service of notice of the suspension of a joint tariff or schedule on a carrier or a broker, except a freight forwarder, that filed that tariff or schedule to which another carrier or broker is a party and, if the carrier is a water carrier, the notice specifies the classifications, rates, or practices involved, constitutes service of notice on all carriers or brokers that are parties to the joint tariff.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The member of a joint board from a State shall be nominated by the State authority having jurisdiction to regulate intrastate transportation by motor vehicle on the highways of that State. If there is no such authority in that State or if that authority does not nominate a member when requested by the Commission, the chief executive officer of the State may nominate the member. If both that State authority and the chief executive officer of that State do not nominate a member when requested, the board is constituted without a member from that State if the Commission has appointed members for at least 2 other States to the board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When a matter required to be referred to a joint board involves the operation of a motor carrier in or through a place outside the United States, if only one State is involved or if only one State nominates an individual to be a member of the joint board, that State may nominate and the Commission may appoint not more than 3 members to the board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A substitution in the membership of a joint board may be made at any time in the same manner as an initial nomination and appointment under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) When a member of a joint board does not participate in a proceeding referred to that board, after notice of the proceeding, the State from which that member was appointed waives its right to act in that proceeding. The waiver does not affect the duty or power of remaining members of the board to continue the proceeding and make an initial decision.</p>

<p class="note-body">In the introductory matter of subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;Subject to this chapter and other provisions of law&rdquo; are inserted to inform the reader that other sections of the chapter and subtitle qualify the grant of jurisdiction to the Interstate Commerce Commission under the section. The words &ldquo;the Interstate Commerce Commission has jurisdiction&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;The provisions of this chapter shall apply to&rdquo; in 49:1(1) and (2) to eliminate surplus language and for clarity because the intent of the words is to grant the Commission jurisdiction. The words &ldquo;over transportation&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;to common carriers engaged in&rdquo; in 49:1(1) and &ldquo;to such transportation of passengers and property&rdquo; in 49:1(2) to eliminate redundancy and for consistency with the other general jurisdictional statements at the beginning of each of the subchapters of chapter 105 of the revised title, giving the Commission jurisdiction over transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1), before clause (A), the words &ldquo;rail carrier, express carrier, sleeping car carrier, water common carrier, and pipeline carrier&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;common carriers&rdquo; for clarity and because a definition of &ldquo;common carrier&rdquo; has been adopted for the subtitle that is broader and includes common carriers other than those to which 49:1(1) and (2) apply.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1)(C), the words &ldquo;natural or artificial&rdquo; in 49:1(1)(b), before &ldquo;gas&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;and&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;except water and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gas&rdquo; in 49:1(1)(b), for clarification because the exemption does not require the pipeline transportation of both water and gas before the exception applies. The exclusion of pipeline transportation of oil from the jurisdiction of the Commission is inserted in view of section 306 of the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. 95&ndash;91), transferring the functions of the Commission related to transporting oil by pipeline to the Department of Energy. The conferees of the 2 Houses explain in their joint statement that the transfer is intended to include &ldquo;pipeline transportation of crude and refined petroleum and petroleum byproducts, derivatives or petrochemicals.&rdquo; See House Report 95&ndash;539, page 69.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2)(A), the words &ldquo;District of Columbia&rdquo; are omitted in view of the definition of &ldquo;State&rdquo; in section 10102 of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;a State (other than the District of Columbia)&rdquo; are inserted to exclude the District of Columbia from the jurisdictional exemption in view of 49:1(2) that does not now exempt the District of Columbia but would become exempt, but for the exclusion, as the result of the definition of &ldquo;State&rdquo; adopted for the revised title. The words &ldquo;except as otherwise provided in this subtitle&rdquo; are inserted for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;passengers or property&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; that applies to the subtitle.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;does not affect&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;nothing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall impair or affect&rdquo; for clarity and to eliminate redundancy.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) When a rail carrier and a water common carrier may or do provide jointly, transportation, not entirely in one State from a place in the United States to another place in the United States, even if part of the transportation is outside the United States, the Interstate Commerce Commission has the following jurisdiction over that transportation:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To establish a physical connection between the railroad lines of the rail carrier and the dock at which an interchange is to be made, the Commission may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) require the rail carrier to make a suitable connection between its lines and tracks that have been constructed from the dock to the limits of the railroad right-of-way;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) subject to the same restrictions on findings of public convenience and necessity and other matters that are imposed on construction under sections 10901, 10902, and 10907 of this title, require the rail carrier or water common carrier, or both, to construct to the dock at least one track connecting with the lines of the rail carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) determine and prescribe the conditions under which a connecting track is to be operated; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in the construction or operation of the track, determine the sum to be paid to, or by, either carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Commission may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) prescribe proportional rates, maximum proportional rates, minimum proportional rates, or maximum and minimum proportional rates, of a rail carrier to and from the ports to which the passengers or property is transported by the water common carrier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) determine the passengers, property, vessels, and on which conditions those rates apply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In this paragraph, &ldquo;proportional rates&rdquo; means those rates that differ from the corresponding local rates to and from a port and apply only to passengers or property brought to the port or carried from the port by a water common carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may act under this section only after a full hearing. An order entered as the result of an action may be conditioned on giving security for the payment of an amount of money or the discharge of an obligation that is required to be paid or discharged under that order.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10525. Exempt motor carrier transportation entirely in one State</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission shall exempt transportation of a motor carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this subchapter from compliance with this subtitle when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the motor carrier provides transportation entirely in one State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Commission finds that the nature or quantity of transportation provided by the motor carrier does not substantially affect or impair uniform regulation by the Commission of motor carrier transportation in carrying out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may begin a proceeding under this section on its own initiative or on application of a motor carrier, a State authority having jurisdiction to regulate intrastate transportation by motor vehicle on the highways of that State, or an interested party. An application must be under oath and must contain information required by Commission regulation. The Commission may exempt the transportation by motor carrier or class of motor carriers. When an exemption is granted, the Commission shall issue a certificate of exemption describing the conditions required by the public interest under which the certificate is issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When an application for exemption is accompanied by a certificate of the authority of the State in which the applicant provides transportation stating the finding of the State authority that the applicant is entitled to a certificate of exemption under this section, the exemption is effective on the 60th day after the application is filed with the Commission unless the Commission denies the application before that date. If not denied before that date, the exemption remains effective until the Commission thereafter denies or revokes it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Commission may revoke any part of an exemption granted under this section when it finds that the nature or quantity of the transportation by the motor carrier or class of motor carriers affects or impairs, or is likely substantially to affect or impair uniform regulation by the Commission of motor carrier transportation in carrying out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title. If the exemption is revoked, the Commission shall restore without further proceedings the authority any such motor carrier had to provide transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this subchapter at the time the exemption was effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the Commission has no jurisdiction under this subchapter over transportation, except transportation of household goods, by a motor carrier operating solely within the State of Hawaii. The State of Hawaii may regulate transportation exempt from the jurisdiction of the <!-- PDFPage:204 -->Commission under this subsection and, to the extent provided by a motor carrier operating solely within the State of Hawaii, transportation exempt from the jurisdiction of the Commission under section 10523 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) State regulation of the operations of a motor carrier covered by an exemption under this section is not a burden on interstate or foreign commerce.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) entirely in one harbor or between places in contiguous harbors, other than transportation under common control, management, or arrangement for a continuous carriage or shipment to or from a place outside the limits of the harbor or the contiguous harbors;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may exempt from its jurisdiction under this subchapter the transportation of passengers between places in the United States through a foreign port when the Commission finds its jurisdiction is not necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title.

The Commission may prescribe conditions applicable to an exemption under this subsection. The Commission may begin a proceeding under this subsection on application of a water contract carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Commission does not have jurisdiction under this subtitle over transportation by a water common carrier provided between the 48 contiguous States or the District of Columbia, and Alaska if, before January 3, 1959&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The transportation remains subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Maritime Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Commission shall exempt the transportation of property on a vessel furnished by a water contract carrier to a person not a carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this subtitle when the person uses the vessel to transport its own property and the Commission finds its jurisdiction is not necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title. The Commission may begin a proceeding under this section on its own initiative or on application of an interested party. The Commission may exempt the transportation by person or class of persons. The Commission shall specify the period of time during which the exemption is effective. The Commission may revoke the exemption when it finds that its jurisdiction over the transportation of the property is necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101. The Commission may deny or revoke an exemption only after an opportunity for a proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) The Commission shall exempt the transportation of property by a water carrier under this subchapter when the Commission finds that the carrier is transporting only the property of a person owning substantially all of the voting stock of the carrier. When an exemption is granted, the Commission shall issue a certificate of exemption. The Commission may begin a proceeding under this subsection on its own initiative or on application of an interested party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may revoke an exemption granted under this subsection when it finds the water carrier is no longer entitled to the exemption. If the exemption is revoked, the Commission shall restore without further proceedings the authority the water carrier had to provide transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this subchapter at the time the exemption became effective.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;does not have jurisdiction under this subchapter&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the provisions of this part shall not apply&rdquo; for clarity and to conform to the terms used in chapter 105 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;to exercise jurisdiction&rdquo; are inserted for clarity and to conform to the language of section 10526(b) of the revised title.

The words &ldquo;in interstate commerce&rdquo; are omitted for consistency and as unnecessary because the Commission only has jurisdiction when specified interstate or foreign commerce is involved.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2), the word &ldquo;vessel&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;small vessel&rdquo; because &ldquo;vessel&rdquo; is a defined term in section 10102 of the revised title that applies to &ldquo;watercraft&rdquo; and the balance of the clause explains what &ldquo;small&rdquo; means.</p>

The words &ldquo;and limitations&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;by order .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. such of the transportation engaged in by such carrier as it finds necessary to carry out the policy above declared&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (d) restates the source provisions for clarity and consistency. The word &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;operations&rdquo; because the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission is over transportation and the operations of a carrier are included in the definition of transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (e) restates the source provisions for clarity and consistency. The words &ldquo;after an opportunity for a proceeding&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;reasonable opportunity for hearing&rdquo; for consistency.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10701. Standards for rates, classifications, through routes, rules, and practices</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A rate (other than a rail rate), classification, rule, or practice related to transportation or service provided by a carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under chapter 105 of this title must be reasonable. A through route established by such a carrier (including a rail carrier) must be reasonable. Divisions of joint rates by those carriers (including rail carriers) must be made without unreasonable discrimination against a participating carrier and must be reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">[(b) Repealed. Pub. L. 96&ndash;448, title II, &sect;201(b)(2), Oct. 14, 1980, 94 Stat. 1900.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I or III of chapter 105 of this title may not discriminate in its rates against a connecting line of another carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under either of those subchapters or unreasonably discriminate against that line in the distribution of traffic that is not routed specifically by the shipper.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In a proceeding to determine whether a rate for transportation or service provided by a common carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II, III, or IV of chapter 105 of this title complies with subsection (a) of this section, the good will, earning power, or certificate or permit under which that carrier is operating may not be considered or admitted as evidence of the value of the property of that carrier. When the carrier receives a certificate or permit under chapter 109 of this title, it is considered to have agreed to this subsection for itself and for all transferees of that certificate or permit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Except as provided in subsection (f), in proceedings to determine the reasonableness of rate levels for a motor carrier or group of motor carriers, or in proceedings to determine the reasonableness of a territorial rate structure where rates are proposed through agreements authorized by section 10706(b) of this title, the Commission shall authorize revenue levels that are adequate under honest, economical, and efficient management to cover total operating expenses, including the operation of leased equipment and depreciation, plus a reasonable profit. The standards and procedures adopted by the Commission under this subsection shall allow the carriers to achieve revenue levels that will provide a flow of net income, plus depreciation, adequate to support prudent capital outlays, assure the repayment of a reasonable level of debt, permit the raising of needed equity capital, attract and retain capital in amounts adequate to provide a sound motor carrier transportation system in the United States, and take into account reasonable estimated or foreseeable future costs. Any complaint brought against a motor carrier (other than a carrier described in subsection (f)(1)(A)) by a person (other than a motor carrier) for unreasonably high rates for past or future transportation shall be determined under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Procedures for Resolving Claims Involving Unfiled, Negotiated Transportation Rates.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a claim is made by a motor carrier of property (other than a household goods carrier) providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title, by a freight forwarder (other than a household goods freight forwarder), or by a party representing such a carrier or freight forwarder regarding the collection of rates or charges for such transportation in addition to those originally billed and collected by the carrier or freight forwarder for such transportation, the person against whom the claim is made may elect to satisfy the claim under the provisions of paragraph (2), (3), or (4) of this subsection, upon showing that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the carrier or freight forwarder is no longer transporting property or is transporting property for the purpose of avoiding the application of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with respect to the claim&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the person was offered a transportation rate by the carrier or freight forwarder other than that legally on file with the Commission for the transportation service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the person tendered freight to the carrier or freight forwarder in reasonable reliance upon the offered transportation rate;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:217 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the carrier or freight forwarder did not properly or timely file with the Commission a tariff providing for such transportation rate or failed to enter into an agreement for contract carriage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) such transportation rate was billed and collected by the carrier or freight forwarder; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the carrier or freight forwarder demands additional payment of a higher rate filed in a tariff.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If there is a dispute as to the showing under subparagraph (A), such dispute shall be resolved by the court in which the claim is brought. If there is a dispute as to the showing under subparagraph (B), such dispute shall be resolved by the Commission. Pending the resolution of any such dispute, the person shall not have to pay any additional compensation to the carrier or freight forwarder. Satisfaction of the claim under paragraph (2), (3), or (4) of this subsection shall be binding on the parties, and the parties shall not be subject to chapter 119 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Claims involving shipments weighing 10,000 pounds or less</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person from whom the additional legally applicable and effective tariff rate or charges are sought may elect to satisfy the claim if the shipments each weighed 10,000 pounds or less, by payment of 20 percent of the difference between the carrier's applicable and effective tariff rate and the rate originally billed and paid. In the event that a dispute arises as to the rate that was legally applicable to the shipment, such dispute shall be resolved by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Claims involving shipments weighing more than 10,000 pounds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person from whom the additional legally applicable and effective tariff rate or charges are sought may elect to satisfy the claim if the shipments each weighed more than 10,000 pounds, by payment of 15 percent of the difference between the carrier's applicable and effective tariff rate and the rate originally billed and paid. In the event that a dispute arises as to the rate that was legally applicable to the shipment, such dispute shall be resolved by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Claims involving public warehousemen</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), a person from whom the additional legally applicable and effective tariff rate or charges are sought may elect to satisfy the claim by payment of 5 percent of the difference between the carrier's applicable and effective tariff rate and the rate originally billed and paid if such person is a public warehouseman. In the event that a dispute arises as to the rate that was legally applicable to the shipment, such dispute shall be resolved by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Effects of election</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a person from whom additional legally applicable freight rates or charges are sought does not elect to use the provisions of paragraph (2), (3), or (4), the person may pursue all rights and remedies existing under this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <cap-smallcap>Stay of additional compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a person proceeds under this section to challenge the reasonableness of the legally applicable freight rate or charges being claimed by a carrier or freight forwarder described in paragraph (1) in addition to those already billed and collected, the person shall not have to pay any additional compensation to the carrier or freight forwarder until the Commission has made a determination as to the reasonableness of the challenged rate as applied to the freight of the person against whom the claim is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on statutory construction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as authorized in paragraphs (2), (3), (4), and (9) of this subsection, nothing in this subsection shall relieve a motor common carrier of the duty to file and adhere to its rates, rules, and classifications as required in sections 10761 and 10762 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) <cap-smallcap>Notification of election.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>General rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person must notify the carrier or freight forwarder as to its election to proceed under paragraph (2), (3), or (4). Except as provided in subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D), such election may be made at any time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Demands for payment initially made after date of enactment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the carrier or freight forwarder or party representing such carrier or freight forwarder initially demands the payment of additional freight charges after the date of the enactment of this subsection and notifies the person from whom additional freight charges are sought of the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (7) at the time of the making of such initial demand, the election must be made not later than the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the 60th day following the filing of an answer to a suit for the collection of such additional legally applicable freight rate or charges, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the 90th day following the date of the enactment of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Pending suits for collection made before or on date of enactment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the carrier or freight forwarder or party representing such carrier or freight forwarder has filed, before or on the date of the enactment of this subsection, a suit for the collection of additional freight charges and notifies the person from whom additional freight charges are sought of the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (7), the election must be made not later than the 90th day following the date on which such notification is received.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Demands for payment made before or on date of enactment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the carrier or freight forwarder or party representing such carrier or freight forwarder has demanded the payment of additional freight charges, and has not filed a suit for the collection of such additional freight charges, before or on the date of the enactment of this subsection and notifies the person from whom additional freight charges are sought of the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (7), the election must be made not later than the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the 60th day following the filing of an answer to a suit for the collection of such additional legally applicable freight rate or charges, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the 90th day following the date of the enactment of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:218 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) <cap-smallcap>Claims involving small-business concerns, charitable organizations, and recyclable materials</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), a person from whom the additional legally applicable and effective tariff rate or charges are sought shall not be liable for the difference between the carrier's applicable and effective tariff rate and the rate originally billed and paid&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if such person qualifies as a small-business concern under the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if such person is an organization which is described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under section 501(a) of such Code, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) or (c) of this section and unless a rate is prohibited by a provision of this title, a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may establish any rate for transportation or other service provided by the carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) If the Commission determines, under section 10709 of this title, that a rail carrier has market dominance over the transportation to which a particular rate applies, the rate established by such carrier for such transportation must be reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any proceeding to determine the reasonableness of a rate described in paragraph (1) of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the shipper challenging such rate shall have the burden of proving that such rate is not reasonable if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such rate (I) is authorized under section 10707a of this title, and (II) results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for the transportation to which the rate applies that is less than the lesser of the percentages described in clauses (i) and (ii) of section 10707a(e)(2)(A) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such rate does not meet the description set forth in clause (i) of this subparagraph, but the Commission does not begin an investigation proceeding under section 10707 of this title to determine whether such rate is reasonable; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the rail carrier establishing the challenged rate shall have the burden of proving that such rate is reasonable if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such rate (I) is greater than that authorized under section 10707a of this title, or (II) results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for the transportation to which the rate applies that is equal to or greater than the lesser of the percentages described in clauses (i) and (ii) of section 10707a(e)(2)(A) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the Commission begins an investigation proceeding under section 10707 of this title to determine whether such rate is reasonable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In determining whether a rate established by a rail carrier is reasonable for purposes of this section, the Commission shall recognize the policy of this subtitle that rail carriers shall earn adequate revenues, as established by the Commission under section 10704(a)(2) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A rate for transportation or other service provided by a rail carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may not be established below a reasonable minimum. Any rate for transportation by such a rail carrier that does not contribute to the going concern value of such carrier is presumed to be not reasonable. A rate that contributes to the going concern value of such carrier is conclusively presumed not to be below a reasonable minimum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A rate for transportation by a rail carrier that equals or exceeds the variable cost of providing the transportation is conclusively presumed to contribute to the going concern value of such rail carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Upon the filing of a complaint alleging that a rate is in violation of this subsection, the Commission shall take final action thereon by the 90th day after the date such complaint is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission determines, based on the record after opportunity for a hearing, that a rate is in violation of this subsection, the Commission shall order such rate to be raised, but only to the minimum level required by this subsection. The complainant shall have the burden of proving that such rate is in violation of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) For purposes of this subsection, variable costs shall be determined under formulas or procedures prescribed or certified by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the determination of variable costs for purposes of minimum rate regulation, the Commission shall, on application of the rail carrier proposing the rate, determine only the costs of such carrier and only those costs of the specific service in question unless the specific information is not available. The Commission may not include in such variable costs an expense that does not vary directly with the level of transportation provided under the proposed rate.</p>

However, this subsection does not require a motor contract carrier to maintain the same rates and rules related to those rates for the same transportation provided to shippers served by it. The Commission may grant relief from this subsection when relief is consistent with the public interest and the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) When the Interstate Commerce Commission, after a full hearing, decides that a rate <!-- PDFPage:224 -->charged or collected by a carrier for transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, or that a classification, rule, or practice of that carrier, does or will violate this subtitle, the Commission may prescribe the rate (including a maximum or minimum rate, or both), classification, rule, or practice to be followed. The Commission may order the carrier to stop the violation. When a rate, classification, rule, or practice is prescribed under this subsection, the affected carrier may not publish, charge, or collect a different rate and shall adopt the classification and observe the rule or practice prescribed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall maintain and revise as necessary standards and procedures for establishing revenue levels for rail carriers providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under that subchapter that are adequate, under honest, economical, and efficient management, to cover total operating expenses, including depreciation and obsolescence, plus a reasonable and economic profit or return (or both) on capital employed in the business. The Commission shall make an adequate and continuing effort to assist those carriers in attaining revenue levels prescribed under this paragraph. However, a rate, classification, rule, or practice of a rail carrier may be maintained at a particular level to protect the traffic of another carrier or mode of transportation only if the Commission finds that the rate or classification, or rule or practice related to it, reduces or would reduce the going concern value of the carrier charging the rate. Revenue levels established under this paragraph should&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide a flow of net income plus depreciation adequate to support prudent capital outlays, assure the repayment of a reasonable level of debt, permit the raising of needed equity capital, and cover the effects of inflation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) attract and retain capital in amounts adequate to provide a sound transportation system in the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall conclude a proceeding under paragraph (2) of this subsection within 180 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and thereafter as necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) On the basis of the standards and procedures under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Commission shall, within 180 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and on an annual basis thereafter, determine which rail carriers are earning adequate revenues.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) When the Commission decides that a rate charged or collected by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a motor common carrier for providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title by itself, with another motor common carrier, with a rail, express, or water common carrier, or any of them;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a water common carrier for providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under subchapter III of chapter 105 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a household goods freight forwarder for providing service subject to its jurisdiction under subchapter IV of chapter 105 of this title;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">or that a classification, rule, or practice of that carrier, does or will violate this chapter, the Commission shall prescribe the rate (including a maximum or minimum rate, or both), classification, rule, or practice to be followed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) When prescribing a rate, classification, rule, or practice for transportation or service by common carriers other than by rail carrier, the Commission shall consider, among other factors, the effect of the prescribed rate, classification, rule, or practice on the movement of traffic by that carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) When prescribing a rate, classification, rule, or practice for transportation or service by common carriers other than by rail carrier or motor carrier, the Commission shall consider, among other factors, the need for revenues that are sufficient, under honest, economical, and efficient management, to let the carrier provide that transportation or service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the carrier is a motor or water common carrier or a household goods freight forwarder, the Commission shall also consider the need, in the public interest, of adequate and efficient transportation or service by that carrier at the lowest cost consistent with providing that transportation or service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the carrier is a motor common carrier or a household goods freight forwarder, the Commission shall also consider the inherent advantages of transportation by motor common carrier or the inherent nature of household goods freight forwarding, respectively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) When the Commission finds that a minimum rate of a contract carrier for transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II or III of chapter 105 of this title, or a rule or practice related to the rate or the value of the service under it, violates this chapter or the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title, the Commission may prescribe the minimum rate, rule, or practice for the carrier that is desirable in the public interest and will promote that policy. In prescribing the rate, the Commission may not give a motor or water contract carrier an advantage or preference in competition with a motor or water common carrier, respectively, if an advantage or preference is unreasonable or inconsistent with the public interest and the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When prescribing a minimum rate, or rule or practice related to a rate, for a contract carrier, the Commission shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the cost of the transportation provided by the carrier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the effect of a prescribed minimum rate, or rule or practice, on the movement of traffic by that carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In a proceeding involving competition between carriers of different modes of transportation subject to this subtitle, except rail carriers, the Commission, in determining whether a rate is less than a reasonable minimum rate, shall consider the facts and circumstances involved in moving the traffic by the mode of carrier to which the rate is applicable. Subject to the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title, rates of a carrier may not be maintained at a particular level to protect the traffic of another mode of transportation.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:225 --><p class="statutory-body">(e) In a proceeding involving a proposed increase or decrease in rail carrier rates, the Commission shall specifically consider allegations that the increase or decrease would (1) change the rate relationships between commodities, ports, places, regions, areas, or other particular descriptions of traffic (without regard to previous Commission consideration or approval of those relationships), and (2) have a significant adverse effect on the competitive position of shippers or consignees served by the rail carrier proposing the increase or decrease. The Commission shall investigate to determine whether the change or effect violates this subtitle when it finds that those allegations are substantially supported on the record. The investigation may be made either before or after the proposed increase or decrease becomes effective and either in that proceeding or in another proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Commission may begin a proceeding under this section on its own initiative or on complaint. A complaint under subsection (a) of this section must be made under section 11701 of this title, but the proceeding may also be in extension of a complaint pending before the Commission. A complaint under subsection (c) of this section must contain a full statement of the facts and the reasons for the complaint and must be made under oath.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10705. Authority: through routes, joint classifications, rates, and divisions prescribed by Interstate Commerce Commission</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Interstate Commerce Commission may, and shall when it considers it desirable in the public interest, prescribe through routes, joint classifications, joint rates (including maximum or minimum rates or both), the division of joint rates, and the conditions under which those routes must be operated, for a common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I, II (except a motor common carrier of property), or III of chapter 105 of this title. When one of the carriers on a through route is a water carrier, the Commission shall prescribe a differential between an all-rail rate and a joint rate related to the water carrier if the differential is justified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may require a rail carrier to include in a through route substantially less than the entire length of its railroad and any intermediate railroad operated with it under common management or control if that intermediate railroad lies between the terminals of the through route only when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) required under section 10741&ndash;10744 or 11103 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) one of the carriers is a water carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) inclusion of those lines would make the through route unreasonably long when compared with a practicable alternative through route that could be established; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the Commission decides that the proposed through route is needed to provide adequate, and more efficient or economic, transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall give reasonable preference, subject to this subsection, to the rail carrier originating the traffic when prescribing through routes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission may not prescribe&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a through route, classification, practice, or rate between a street electric passenger railway not engaged in the general business of transporting freight in addition to its passenger and express business and (i) a rail carrier of a different character, or (ii) a water common carrier; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a through route or joint rate applicable to it to assist a participating carrier to meet its financial needs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Interstate Commerce Commission may, and shall when it considers it desirable in the public interest, prescribe through routes, joint classifications, joint rates (including maximum or minimum rates or both), the division of joint rates, and the conditions under which those routes must be operated, for a motor common carrier of property providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title with another such carrier or with a water common carrier of property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may not require a motor common carrier of property, without its consent, to include in a through route substantially less than the entire length of its route and the route of any intermediate carrier which is operated in conjunction and under common management or control with such motor common carrier of property which lies between the termini of such proposed through routes (A) unless inclusion of such routes would make the through route unreasonably circuitous as compared with another practicable through route which could <!-- PDFPage:227 -->otherwise be established, or (B) unless the Commission finds that the through route proposed to be established is needed in order to provide adequate, more efficient, or more economic transportation. In prescribing through routes the Commission shall, so far as is consistent with the public interest, and subject to the preceding sentence, give reasonable preference to the carrier which originates the traffic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission shall prescribe the division of joint rates to be received by a carrier providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under chapter 105 of this title when it decides that a division of joint rates established by the participating carriers under section 10703 of this title, or under a decision of the Commission under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, does or will violate section 10701 of this title. When prescribing the division of joint rates of a rail carrier, water carrier, or motor common carrier of property under this subsection, the Commission shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the efficiency with which the carriers concerned are operated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of revenue required by the carriers to pay their operating expenses and taxes and receive a fair return on the property held and used for transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the importance of the transportation to the public;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) whether a particular participating carrier is an originating, intermediate, or delivering line; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) other circumstances that ordinarily, without regard to the mileage traveled, entitle one carrier to a different proportion of a rate than another carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If a division of a joint rate prescribed under a decision of the Commission is later found to violate section 10701 of this title, the Commission may decide what division would have been reasonable and order adjustment to be made retroactive to the date the complaint was filed, the date the order for an investigation was made, or a later date that the Commission decides is justified. The Commission may make a decision under this paragraph effective as part of its original decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) When the Commission suspends, for investigation, a tariff of a rail carrier, water common carrier, or motor common carrier of property that would cancel a through route, joint rate, or classification without the consent of all carriers that are parties to it or without authorization of the Commission, the carrier proposing the cancellation has the burden of proving that cancellation is consistent with the public interest without regard to subsection (a)(2) of this section. In determining whether a cancellation involving a rail carrier is consistent with the public interest, the Commission shall, to the extent applicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) compare the distance traveled and the average transportation time and expense required using (A) the through route, and (B) alternative routes, between the places served by the through route;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consider any reduction in energy consumption that may result from cancellation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) consider the overall impact of cancellation on the shippers and carriers that are affected by it.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) The Commission may begin a proceeding under subsection (a) or (b) of this section on its own initiative or on complaint. The Commission must complete all evidentiary proceedings to adjust the division of joint rates for transportation by a rail carrier within 9 months after the complaint is filed if the proceeding is brought on complaint or within 18 months after the commencement of a proceeding on the initiative of the Commission. The Commission must take final action by the 180th day after completion of the evidentiary proceedings, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) when the proceeding involves a railroad in reorganization or a contention that the divisions at issue do not cover the variable costs of handling the traffic, the Commission shall give the proceedings preference over all other proceedings and shall take final action at the earliest practicable time, which in no event may exceed 100 days after the completion of the evidentiary proceedings; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in all cases other than those specified in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Commission may decide to extend such a proceeding to permit its fair and expeditious completion, but whenever the Commission decides to extend a proceeding pursuant to this clause, it must report its reasons to Congress.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When a carrier begins a proceeding to adjust the division of joint rates for transportation by a rail carrier under this section by filing a complaint with the Commission, the carrier must also file all of the evidence in support of its position with the complaint and, during the course of the proceeding may only file rebuttal or reply evidence unless otherwise ordered by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) When the Commission receives a notice of intent to begin a proceeding to adjust the division of joint rates for transportation by a rail carrier under this section, the Commission shall allow the party filing the notice the same right to discovery that a party would have on filing a complaint under this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10705a. Joint rate surcharges and cancellations</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may publish and apply a surcharge increasing or decreasing the through charge applicable to any movement between points designated by the surcharging carrier subject to a joint rate. Such a surcharge may be applied without the concurrence of the other carriers that are party in such joint rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A carrier earning adequate revenues, as determined under section 10704(a)(2) of this title, may not apply such a surcharge to any movement on a line operated by such carrier which carried more than 3,000,000 gross ton miles of traffic per mile in the preceding calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any surcharge applied pursuant to this subsection must be applied in equal dollar amounts to the movement subject to the surcharge over all routes between the points designated by the surcharging carrier which such carrier participates in under the joint rate involved, and when the surcharge increases the through charges, under any of such carrier's single line rates between the same points.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Whenever a rail carrier applies a surcharge increasing a through charge pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, any other rail carrier that participates in any movement subject to such surcharge may cancel the application of such surcharge to any route participated in by such other carrier, if such carrier makes the demonstration described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A rail carrier may cancel the application of a surcharge under this paragraph if such carrier demonstrates to the Commission that the surcharging carrier's share of the revenues, at the time the surcharge was filed with the Commission, from its participation in the movement over the route involved would have been equal to or greater than 110 percent of its variable costs of providing service over such route, under either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the applicable joint rate in effect at the time the surcharge was filed with the Commission, without the surcharge;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a new rate division increasing the share of the surcharging carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) a new higher lawful rate published by the canceling carrier; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) a new, lesser surcharge which shall be prescribed by the Commission upon and in conformity with the request of the carrier proposing to cancel the surcharge. Any such prescribed surcharge shall, in conjunction with the surcharging carrier's division of the joint rate in effect on the date the original surcharge was filed with the Commission, provide the carrier proposing the original surcharge revenues equal to or greater than 110 percent of such surcharging carrier's variable cost of providing service over such route.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) The canceling tariff shall only become effective if the rail carrier proposing to cancel the application of the surcharge makes the demonstration described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the demonstration described in clause (i) of this subparagraph is made on the basis of the applicable joint rate in effect at the time the surcharge was filed with the Commission, without the surcharge, the tariff shall become effective on one day's notice after such determination is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If the demonstration described in clause (i) of this subparagraph is made on the basis of a new rate, division, or surcharge prescribed pursuant to subparagraph (B)(iv) of this paragraph, the tariff shall become effective on the date such new rate, division, or surcharge becomes effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The remedy available to a rail carrier canceling the application of a surcharge under this paragraph shall be in addition to any other remedy available to such carrier under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Commission may cancel the application of a surcharge to a route to which such surcharge applies if a shipper moving traffic over such route demonstrates to the Commission that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) there is no competitive alternative to such route for the movement of the traffic involved that is not subject to such surcharge; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the surcharging carrier's share of the revenues from its participation in the move<!-- PDFPage:230 -->ment over the route to which such surcharge applies, under the applicable joint rate in effect at the time the surcharge was filed with the Commission, with the surcharge, would be greater than 110 percent of its variable cost of providing service over such route.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission cancels the application of a surcharge to a particular route pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Commission shall determine the level of surcharge which, in conjunction with the surcharging carrier's division of the joint rate in effect at the time the surcharge was filed with the Commission, would equal 110 percent of the surcharging carrier's variable cost of providing service over such route, and shall authorize such carrier immediately to apply such a surcharge without any further proceedings under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A rail carrier may not apply a surcharge under this subsection unless, for the one-year period preceding the surcharge, such carrier has concurred in all rate increases of general applicability applicable to the joint rate to which such surcharge applies and agreed to by all other carriers that are party to such joint rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A rail carrier may not apply a surcharge under this subsection increasing a through charge applicable to a particular movement more than once each calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a rail carrier may, by tariff, reduce the total charges applicable to a movement over any specific joint line or single line route or routes in which such carrier participates, if such reduction does not lower the total charges applicable to such movement to a level that is less than the lowest total charges applicable to the same movement over a competing route. Any such reduction may be made without the concurrence of any other rail carrier, and shall be borne solely by the carrier reducing the charge. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the right of a carrier to reduce rates over routes not in direct competition between the same points with routes to which it has applied a surcharge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a rail carrier not earning adequate revenues, as determined under section 10704(a)(2) of this title, may publish and apply a surcharge applicable to traffic originating or terminating upon any of its lines that carried less than 3,000,000 gross ton miles of traffic per mile in the most recent calendar year for which traffic data is available; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a rail carrier earning adequate revenues, as so determined, may publish and apply a surcharge applicable to traffic originating or terminating upon any of its lines that carried less than 1,000,000 gross ton miles of traffic per mile in such most recent calendar year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such a surcharge may be applied without the concurrence of any rail carrier. Any such surcharge may be allocated, subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this subsection, in different amounts among different movements between different origins and destinations, and shall accrue solely to the surcharging carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A rail carrier may apply a surcharge under this subsection if, prior to the application of such surcharge, that portion of the charges applicable to traffic to and from the line to which the surcharge applies and accruing to the surcharging carrier does not provide such carrier revenues adequate to cover&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 110 percent of such carrier's variable cost of transporting the traffic involved to or from such line; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 100 percent of such carrier's reasonably expected costs of continuing to operate such line, which shall include all costs necessary to sustain service on the line.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall, within 120 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, complete a proceeding to define the term &ldquo;reasonably expected costs&rdquo; as used in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. In the interim, the term shall be construed in accordance with Rail Services Planning Office subsidy standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Upon petition of a shipper located upon a line to which a surcharge under this subsection is applied, the Commission may cancel the application of a surcharge under this subsection if such shipper demonstrates to the Commission that, after application of the surcharge, the surcharging carrier's revenues from all traffic originating or terminating upon the line to which the surcharge applies exceed 110 percent of such carrier's variable cost of transporting all traffic to or from such line plus such carrier's reasonably expected costs of continuing to operate such line.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) A rail carrier's revenue from all traffic originating or terminating upon a line shall be presumed to exceed 110 percent of its variable cost of transporting all traffic to or from such line plus its reasonably expected costs of continuing to operate such line if the complaining shipper demonstrates that the carrier is earning revenues from all traffic originating or terminating upon such line that result in a revenue-variable cost percentage that is equal to or greater than the revenue-variable cost percentage applicable in that year under section 10709(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) A surcharging carrier may rebut the presumption set forth in clause (i) of this subparagraph by demonstrating to the Commission that its reasonably expected costs for operating the line to which the surcharge applies exceed the percentage of variable cost set forth in such clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Upon a finding by the Commission that application of the surcharge will produce revenues in excess of 110 percent of the surcharging carrier's variable cost of transporting traffic to or from the line plus its reasonably expected costs for operating the line, the Commission shall determine the level of surcharge which would produce revenues equal to such figure and shall authorize such carrier immediately to apply such surcharges as will generate such revenues without any further proceedings, subject only to the right of a shipper to proceed under paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) A rail carrier may not apply a surcharge under this subsection that results in any shipper being required to bear more than a reasonable proportion of the reasonably expected costs of continuing to operate the line to which such surcharge applies.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:231 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) Upon complaint of a shipper, the Commission shall determine whether the shipper is being required to bear more than a reasonable proportion of the costs described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the Commission finds that a complaining shipper is being required to bear more than a reasonable proportion of the costs described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Commission may reallocate the surcharge among the traffic originating or terminating on the line to which the surcharge applies, but may not order relief which would result in the surcharging carrier earning revenues less than those which the carrier would have earned had the surcharge been applied as filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A shipper may, in a single complaint, seek relief under paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection. In any such complaint, the Commission shall first determine the right to relief under paragraph (3) and shall grant such relief as is appropriate under such paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In any proceeding brought before the Commission challenging the application or amount of a surcharge under this subsection, whether the surcharge is claimed to violate this subsection or some other provision of this chapter, the Commission shall not suspend the application of any such surcharge unless the person filing the verified statement required by section 10707(c) of this title, in addition to the matters required by such section, also makes the demonstration required by paragraph (3)(A) of this subsection. If the demonstration required by such paragraph (3)(A) is made, the Commission may suspend the application of only so much of the surcharge as will produce revenues in excess of the amount so demonstrated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, any prior agreement in effect on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, or any requirement of the Commission, a rail carrier may cancel the application of a joint rate to a through route in which it participates, without the concurrence of any other rail carrier that is a party to such joint rate, unless another rail carrier that participates in such through route or a shipper that has no competitive alternative to such route makes the demonstration described in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The application of a joint rate to a through route may not be canceled under this subsection if a rail carrier that participates in such through route or a shipper that has no competitive alternative to such route from an origin or destination served by such route demonstrates to the Commission that the canceling carrier's share of the revenues, under the joint rate in effect at the time the application of the joint rate is canceled, is equal to or greater than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 110 percent of the canceling carrier's variable cost of providing service over such route; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such lesser percent of the canceling carrier's variable cost as such carrier earns over a competing through route to which application of the joint rate has not been canceled, or over a competing single line route.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) When a complaining party is unable to make the demonstration required by paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Commission may suspend the tariff canceling the joint rate only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a complaining carrier publishes a new rate division or a new higher lawful rate which increases the canceling carrier's share of the revenues over such route to the amount calculated under paragraph (2)(A) or (2)(B) of this subsection, whichever is less; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a complaining carrier or shipper petitions the Commission and the Commission imposes a surcharge, in conformity with such petition, upon the joint rate which will accrue solely to the canceling carrier and which, in conjunction with the canceling carrier's division of the joint rate in effect on the date the tariff canceling the joint rate was filed, will provide the canceling carrier revenues equal to or greater than 110 percent of its variable cost of providing service over such route.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Unless a new rate, division, or surcharge described in this paragraph becomes effective within 120 days after the proposed effective date of the rate cancellation, the canceling tariff shall, nevertheless, become effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the demonstration described in paragraph (2) is made or a new rate, division, or surcharge described in paragraph (3) becomes effective, the tariff canceling the joint rate shall be considered by the Commission in accordance with section 10705 of this title. The existing joint rate or the new rate division, or surcharge, shall remain in effect during the pendency of the Commission's consideration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Whenever the application of a joint rate to a through route is canceled under this subsection and a rate other than a joint rate is or has been published by the canceling carrier to apply to such route, such rate shall thereafter apply in lieu of all other rates (except joint rates subsequently agreed to by such carrier) and any through rate of which such rate is a factor shall divide as the separate factors of such rate are made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of the Commission under section 10705(a) of this title to prescribe joint rates which provide a rail carrier participating in such joint rate revenues equal to or greater than 110 percent of its variable cost of providing service over each route to which such rate applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, any increase or decrease in revenue resulting from the application of a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section, or from the cancellation of the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section, shall accrue solely to or be borne solely by the carrier applying the surcharge or canceling the application of the joint rate, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever a class III rail carrier which participates in a through route to which a surcharge has been applied under subsection (a) of this section by a carrier operating in the same rate territory as such class III carrier demonstrates to the Commission that the application of such surcharge to such route provides, in the absence of any increase in the joint rate in effect on the date the surcharge was filed with the Commission, revenues from traffic moving over such route to such surcharging carrier in excess of 110 percent of its variable costs over such route, such surcharging carrier shall, from <!-- PDFPage:232 -->the date of such demonstration, share those revenues from such route, from the surcharge and the applicable joint rate in effect on the date the surcharge was filed with the Commission, in excess of 110 percent of its variable costs with all class III rail carriers in the same rate territory participating in such route, on the basis of their existing divisions of the joint rate to which the surcharge applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, whenever a rail carrier proposes to apply a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or to cancel the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section and another rail carrier subsequently agrees to a new rate division or a new lawful rate that increases the surcharging or canceling carrier's share of the total through charges for a movement over a particular through route subject to a joint rate, such other rail carrier shall also agree to any other new rate division and new lawful rate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that is proposed within 120 days after the date of the first agreement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that increases the surcharging or canceling carrier's share of the total through charges for movements over a competing through route subject to such joint rate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A rail carrier shall not be required to agree under this subsection to any proposed new division or new rate which would&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reduce such carrier's share of the total through charges for a movement over any through route to less than (i) 110 percent of its variable costs of providing service over such route, or (ii) such lesser percent of its variable costs as such carrier earns from such movement over a competing through route with respect to which such carrier has agreed to a new division or rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) increase the surcharging or canceling carrier's share of the total through charges for a movement over any through route to an amount in excess of 110 percent of its variable costs of providing service over such route;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) reduce such carrier's share of the total through charges for a movement over any through route by a dollar amount in excess of the greatest dollar reduction which such carrier has agreed to make, for purposes of increasing the surcharging or canceling carrier's share, to its share of the total through charges for a movement over any competing through route; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) reduce such carrier's share of the total through charges for a movement over any through route in an amount in excess of such carrier's pro rata share (based on established divisions for movements over such route) of the increase of the surcharging or canceling carrier's share of the total through charges for movements over such route.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) A rail carrier applying a surcharge or canceling the application of a joint rate under this section shall file a tariff with the Commission in accordance with section 10762 of this title. Such a tariff may not become effective until the expiration of the 45-day period (or such longer period as the filing carrier specifies) beginning on the date such tariff is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Any rail rate to which a surcharge is applied under this section shall be subject to section 10701a and 10709 of this title, and any such surcharge shall constitute a rate increase for purposes of such sections.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of rate regulation under section 10701a of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) only the rail carrier proposing a surcharge under this section shall be required to defend such surcharge; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the reasonableness of the surcharge and the revenues received by the rail carrier proposing the surcharge under the joint rate to which the surcharge applies shall be determined without regard to amount received and services performed by other rail carriers that are party to such joint rate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except as provided in subsection (i), (j), or (k) of this section, if the application of a surcharge or the cancellation of the application of a joint rate under this section is found to constitute a violation of any provision of this subtitle, such violation shall not be ordered remedied in any manner which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) requires the carrier applying a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or canceling the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section to provide service over any route under a rate that provides revenues to such carrier that are less than 110 percent of its variable costs of providing such service; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which requires the carrier applying a surcharge under subsection (b) of this section to provide service over the route to which such surcharge applies in a manner that provides revenues to such carrier that are less than 110 percent of such carrier's variable cost of transporting the traffic involved to or from the line to which the surcharge applies, plus such carrier's reasonably expected costs of providing service over such line.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Within 5 days after the request of a rail carrier participating in a joint rate subject to a surcharge or cancellation under this section, a shipper moving traffic over a route to which such surcharge or cancellation applies, or an affected port, the Commission shall make available to such carrier, shipper, or port the Commission's determination of the variable costs and revenues, over the route or routes to which the surcharge or cancellation applies, of the carrier applying the surcharge or canceling the application of the joint rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) Whenever a class III rail carrier, in a protest filed with the Commission, makes a prima facie showing that the application of a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or the cancellation of the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section will have an adverse effect on competition, the Commission shall investigate such protest. If, on the basis of such investigation, the Commission finds that the protested surcharge or cancellation is or is intended to be anticompetitive, the Commission shall, within 30 days after the date such protest is filed, enter an order rescinding such surcharge or cancellation, and may, on presentation of an adequate record, prescribe new joint rates or divisions of joint rates.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:233 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) No order prescribed under this subsection shall require a carrier to provide service over any route under a rate which provides revenues less than 110 percent of the variable cost of providing such service unless the Commission determines that the public interest requires a lesser revenue to variable cost ratio to avoid anticompetitive action and to preserve service on the route involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j)(1) Any class III rail carrier which originates or terminates traffic subject to the application of a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or the cancellation of the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section may protest such surcharge or cancellation whenever&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such surcharge or cancellation affects the sole remaining route available to that carrier for that traffic; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) such carrier demonstrates that alternative transportation is available or that a shipper dependent on that carrier will suffer significant market loss because of such surcharge or cancellation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) such surcharge or cancellation, alone or when considered in conjunction with other surcharges or cancellations affecting the carrier, is likely to unduly impair a carrier's ability to earn an adequate rate of return.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Commission may, after an investigation on the basis of a protest under this subsection, prescribe a lesser surcharge or a different division of the joint rate. The Commission shall grant the surcharging or canceling carrier revenues not less than 110 percent of its variable cost of the movement involved, unless it determines that the public interest requires a lesser revenue to variable cost ratio to preserve service on the route involved. Any action by the Commission based on a protest under this subsection shall be taken within 30 days after the date such protest is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission prescribes a different division of a joint rate under this paragraph, the Commission shall, upon petition of the surcharging or canceling carrier or the protesting class III rail carrier, reopen the proceeding in which such division was prescribed to reconsider whether such prescribed division is reasonable. If, on the basis of such reconsideration, the Commission determines that such division is not reasonable, it shall prescribe a new, reasonable division of the joint rate to which the surcharge or cancellation applied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) Upon the complaint of a class III rail carrier which originates or terminates traffic subject to the application of a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or the cancellation of the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section that such surcharge or cancellation will result in differences or greater differences in rates, including any surcharges, for the traffic to which the surcharge or cancellation applies over different routes in which the surcharging or canceling carrier participates&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) from a single origin point to destination points within a 75 mile direct radius from the destination point on such class III rail carrier; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to a single destination point from origin points within a 75 mile direct radius from the origin point on such class III rail carrier,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission shall investigate such complaint and shall, within 30 days after the date such complaint is filed, take such actions, including rescinding surcharges or cancellations or prescribing new joint rates or surcharges, as it determines are required to eliminate such differences in rates, unless it finds that such actions are not warranted by the public interest in ensuring effective competition among rail carriers or in the preservation of rail service on the route involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No action taken by the Commission under this subsection shall require a carrier to provide service over any route under a rate which provides a revenue to variable cost ratio over such route less than that provided under the joint rate to which the surcharge or cancellation was applied or less than 110 percent, whichever is greater, unless the Commission determines that the public interest in ensuring effective competition among rail carriers or in preserving service over such route warrants requiring the surcharging or canceling carrier to provide service at a lesser revenue to variable cost ratio.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding subsection (m)(1) of this section, if, in a proceeding under this subsection or under subsection (i) or (j) of this section, the Commission considers whether to require the revenues of a carrier applying a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or canceling the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section to be less than 110 percent of its variable costs (as calculated using the Commission's Rail Form A cost finding methodology), such surcharging or canceling carrier may prove its actual variable costs on the basis of evidence other than unadjusted costs calculated using such Rail Form A cost finding methodology. Such evidence shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) Whenever the application of a joint rate to a through route is canceled under subsection (c) of this section, the Commission shall, upon petition by a class II or III rail carrier participating in such route, prescribe a new compensatory through rate or rates over such route within 30 days after the date such petition is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) variable costs for a class I rail carrier shall be determined only by using such carrier's unadjusted costs, calculated using the Commission's Rail Form A cost finding methodology (or an alternative methodology adopted by the Commission in lieu thereof) and indexed quarterly to account for current wage and price levels in the region in which the carrier operates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) variable costs for a rail carrier other than class I shall be presumed to be the average variable costs of all class I rail carriers in the region in which such carrier operates (as determined under paragraph (1) of this subsection) unless a rail carrier rebuts such presumption with other proof of variable costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) at the option of a carrier applying a surcharge or canceling the application of a joint rate under this section, revenue share may be <!-- PDFPage:234 -->determined by reference to past revenue settlements actually made in the most recent calendar year by connecting lines.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(n) Surcharges applied under subsection (a) or (c) of this section and cancellations under subsection (c) of this section shall not be subject to the provisions of section 10726(a)(1)(B) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>o</em>) The Special Counsel of the Commission may, consistent with the rail transportation policy in section 10101a of this title, provide assistance to class III rail carriers and small businesses in preparing actions under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(p)(1) The authority to apply a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section, and (except as provided in paragraph (2)) the authority to cancel such a surcharge, shall expire 3 years after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 unless extended for one additional year by the Commission upon petition of any rail carrier and for good cause shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any surcharge lawfully applied under subsection (a) of this section shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms following the expiration of the provisions of this section. Any such surcharge applied during the 45-day period immediately preceding the date of the expiration of the provisions of this section shall, notwithstanding such expiration, be subject to cancellation under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section during the 45-day period beginning on the date such surcharge is applied.</p>

However, the Commission may, upon application or on its own initiative, investigate whether the parties to such an agreement have exceeded its scope, and upon a finding that they have, the Commission may issue such orders as are necessary, including an order dissolving the agreement, to ensure that actions taken pursuant to the agreement are limited as provided in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Whenever two or more shippers enter into an agreement to discuss among themselves that relates to the amount of compensation such shippers propose to be paid by rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, for use by such rail carriers of rolling stock owned or leased by such shippers, the shippers shall apply to the Commission for approval of that agreement under this para<!-- PDFPage:236 -->graph. The Commission shall approve the agreement only when it finds that the making and carrying out of the agreement will further the transportation policy set forth in section 10101a of this title and may require compliance with conditions necessary to make the agreement further that policy as a condition of approval. If the Commission approves the agreement, it may be made and carried out under its terms and under the terms required by the Commission, and the antitrust laws set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection do not apply to parties and other persons with respect to making or carrying out the agreement. The Commission shall approve or disapprove an agreement under this paragraph within one year after the date application for approval of such agreement is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission approves an agreement described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and the shippers entering into such agreement and the rail carriers proposing to use rolling stock owned or leased by such shippers, under payment by such carriers or under a published allowance, are unable to agree upon the amount of compensation to be paid for the use of such rolling stock, any party directly involved in the negotiations may require that the matter be settled by submitting the issues in dispute to the Commission. The Commission shall render a binding decision, based upon a standard of reasonableness and after taking into consideration any past precedents on the subject matter of the negotiations, no later than 90 days after the date of the submission of the dispute to the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to change the law in effect prior to the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 with respect to the obligation of rail carriers to utilize rolling stock owned or leased by shippers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;single-line rate&rdquo; refers to a rate, charge, or allowance proposed by a single motor common carrier that is applicable only over its line and for which the transportation can be provided by that carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As provided by this subsection, a motor common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title may enter into an agreement with one or more such carriers concerning rates (including charges between carriers and compensation paid or received for the use of facilities and equipment), allowances, classifications, divisions, or rules related to them, or procedures for joint consideration, initiation, or establishment of them. Such agreement may be submitted to the Commission for approval by any carrier or carriers which are parties to such agreement and shall be approved by the Commission upon a finding that the agreement fulfills each requirement of this subsection, unless the Commission finds that such agreement is inconsistent with the transportation policy set forth in section 10101(a) of this title. The Commission may require compliance with reasonable conditions consistent with this subtitle to assure that the agreement furthers such transportation policy. If the Commission approves the agreement, it may be made and carried out under its terms and under the conditions required by the Commission, and the antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12), do not apply to parties and other persons with respect to making or carrying out the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Agreements submitted to the Commission under this subsection may be approved by the Commission only if each of the following conditions are met:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Each carrier which is a party to an agreement must file with the Commission a verified statement that specifies its name, mailing address, and telephone number of its main office; the names of each of its affiliates; the names, addresses, and affiliates of each of its officers and directors; the names, addresses, and affiliates of each person, together with an affiliate, owning or controlling any debt, equity, or security interest in it having a value of at least $1,000,000. In this subparagraph, &ldquo;affiliate&rdquo; means a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control or ownership with another person and &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; means equity holdings in a business entity of at least 5 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Any organization established or continued under an agreement approved under this subsection must comply with the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) subject to the provisions of subparagraphs (C), (D), (E), and (F) of this paragraph, (I) the organization may allow any member carrier to discuss any rate proposal docketed, but (II) after January 1, 1981, only those carriers with authority to participate in the transportation to which the rate proposal applies may vote upon such rate proposal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the organization may not interfere with each carrier's right of independent action and may not change or cancel any rate established by independent action after the date of enactment of this subsection, other than a general increase or broad rate restructuring, except that changes in such rates may be effected, with the consent of the carrier or carriers that initiated the independent action, for the purpose of tariff simplification, removal of discrimination, or elimination of obsolete items;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the organization may not file a protest or complaint with the Commission against any tariff item published by or for the account of any motor carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the organization may not permit one of its employees or any employee committee to docket or act upon any proposal effecting a change in any tariff item published by or for the account of any of its member carriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) upon request, the organization must divulge to any person the name of the proponent of a rule or rate docketed with it, must admit any person to any meeting at which rates or rules will be discussed or voted upon, and must divulge to any person the vote cast by any member carrier on any proposal before the organization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) the organization may not allow a carrier to vote for one or more other carriers without specific written authority from the carrier being represented; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:237 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(vii) the organization shall make a final disposition of a rule or rate docketed with it by the 120th day after the proposal is docketed, except that if unusual circumstances require, the organization may extend such period, subject to review by the Commission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) No agreement approved under this subsection may provide for discussion of or voting on rates to which the provisions of section 10708(d) or 10730(b) of this title apply, except that rates established or filed under section 10730 of this title before the date of enactment of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 or changes with respect to such rates may be discussed or voted on under agreements approved under this subsection until January 1, 1984.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) No agreement approved under this subsection may provide for discussion of or voting upon single-line rates on or after January 1, 1984, except that such date shall be July 1, 1984, if the Motor Carrier Ratemaking Study Commission does not submit its final report under section 14(b)(4) of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 on or before January 1, 1983. This subparagraph shall not apply to any single-line rate proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers. This subparagraph and subparagraph (B)(i)(II) of this paragraph shall not apply to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) general rate increases or decreases if the agreement gives shippers, under specified procedures, at least 15 days&rsquo; notice of the proposal and an opportunity to present comments on it before a tariff containing the increases or decreases is filed with the Commission and if discussion of such increases or decreases is limited to industry average carrier costs and, after the date of elimination of the antitrust immunity by this subparagraph, does not include discussion of individual markets or particular single-line rates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) changes in commodity classifications;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) changes in tariff structures if discussion of such changes is limited to industry average carrier costs and, after the date of elimination of antitrust immunity by this subparagraph, does not include discussion of individual markets or particular single-line rates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) publishing of tariffs, filing of independent actions for individual members carriers, providing of support services for members, and changes in rules or regulations which are of at least substantially general application throughout the area in which such changes will apply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) On and after January 1, 1983, no agreement approved under this subsection may provide for discussion of or voting upon any single-line rate proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers. On and after January 1, 1984, no agreement approved under this subsection may provide for discussion of or voting upon any joint rate proposed by one or more motor common carriers of passengers. This subparagraph shall not apply to any rate applicable to special or charter transportation. This subparagraph and subparagraph (B)(i)(II) of this paragraph shall not apply to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) any general rate increase or decrease, broad change in tariff structure, or promotional or innovative fare change, as defined by the Commission and subject to such notice requirements as the Commission may specify by regulation, if discussion of such general increase or decrease is limited to industry average carrier costs and intermodal competitive factors and does not include discussion of individual markets or particular single-line rates or joint rates; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) publishing of tariffs, filing of independent actions for individual member carriers, providing of support services for members, and changes in rules or regulations which are of at least substantially general application throughout the area in which such changes will apply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) After the effective date of this subparagraph, no agreement approved under this subsection may provide for discussion of or voting upon any rate applicable to special or charter transportation proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers. This subparagraph shall not apply to publication of any such rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) In any proceeding in which a party to such proceeding alleges that a carrier voted, discussed, or agreed on a rate or allowance in violation of this subsection, that party has the burden of showing that the vote, discussion, or agreement occurred. A showing of parallel behavior does not satisfy that burden by itself.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) The Commission shall, by regulation, determine reasonable quorum standards to be applied for meetings of organizations established or continued under an agreement approved under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, before the date on which the antitrust immunity is eliminated for discussion of or voting on single-line rates by paragraph (3)(D) of this subsection, the Commission may not take any action which would, on the basis of the type of carrier service involved (including service by carriers singly or in combination with other carriers), result in the exclusion of one or more motor common carriers of property from discussion or voting under agreements authorized by this subsection on matters concerning rates, allowances, classifications, or divisions, except that before such date, the Commission may issue regulations which take effect on or after such date to carry out the provisions of such paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle (other than paragraph (3)(F) of this subsection, relating to special and charter transportation of passengers), before January 1, 1983, the Commission may not take any action which would, on the basis of the type of carrier service involved (including service by carriers singly or in combination with other carriers), result in the exclusion of one or more motor common carriers of passengers from discussion or voting under agreements authorized by this subsection on matters concerning rates, allowances, or divisions, except that before January 1, 1983, the Commission may issue regulations which take effect on or after January 1, 1983, to carry out the provisions of paragraph (3)(E) of this subsection.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:238 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under chapter 105 of this title (except a rail carrier or a motor common carrier) that is a party to an agreement of at least 2 carriers related to rates (including charges between carriers and compensation paid or received for the use of facilities and equipment), allowances, classifications, divisions, or rules related to them, or procedures for joint consideration, initiation, or establishment of them, may apply to the Commission for approval of that agreement under this subsection. The Commission shall approve the agreement only when it finds that the making and carrying out of the agreement will further the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title and may require compliance with conditions necessary to make the agreement further that policy as a condition of approval. If the Commission approves the agreement, it may be made and carried out under its terms and under the conditions required by the Commission, and the antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12), do not apply to parties and other persons with respect to making or carrying out the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) In this subsection, carriers are classified as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Rail, express, and sleeping car carriers are a class.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may not approve an agreement under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) between or among carriers of different classes unless, in addition to the finding required under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section, the Commission finds that the agreement is limited to matters related to transportation under joint rates or over through routes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) related to a pooling, division, or other matter to which subchapter III of chapter 113 of this title applies; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) establishing a procedure for determination of a matter through joint consideration unless the Commission finds that each party to the agreement has the absolute right under it to take independent action before or after a determination is made under that procedure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Commission may require an organization established or continued under an agreement approved under this section to maintain records and submit reports. The Commission, or its delegate, may inspect a record maintained under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Commission may review an agreement approved under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section and shall change the conditions of approval or terminate it when necessary to comply with (1) the public interest and subsection (a), or (2) subsection (b) or (c). The Commission shall postpone the effective date of a change of an agreement under this subsection for whatever period it determines to be reasonably necessary to avoid unreasonably hardship.</p>

If the Commission finds that an agreement or organization does not conform to the requirements of that subsection, it shall end or suspend its approval. The Commission shall report to the President and Congress the results of the review as a part of its annual report under section 10311 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) The Federal Trade Commission, in consultation with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, shall prepare periodically an assessment of, and shall report to the Commission on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) possible anticompetitive features of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) agreements approved or submitted for approval under subsection (a) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) an organization operating under those agreements; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) possible ways to alleviate or end an anticompetitive feature, effect, or aspect in a manner that will further the goals of this subtitle and of the transportation policy of section 10101a of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">In this section, the word &ldquo;rates&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;rates, fares&rdquo; because of the definition of &ldquo;rate&rdquo; in section 10102 of this title. The words &ldquo;allowances&rdquo; and &ldquo;charges&rdquo; are retained in view of the context. The word &ldquo;rules&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;rules and regulations&rdquo; for consistency when referring to carriers.</p>

The words inserted in the revised section require rail carriers that make intermodal agreements to comply with 49:5c to reflect the ambiguity. The words &ldquo;under such rules and regulations as the Commission shall prescribe&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary in view of the general power to prescribe regulations under section 10321 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;by order&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;if approval is not prohibited by paragraph (4) or (5)&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary in view of the restatement.

The 3d sentence restates 49:5c(8) for clarity. The word &ldquo;written&rdquo; in 49:5c(2) is omitted as unnecessary in the 4th sentence. 49:5c(2)(v) is omitted as unnecessary because of section 10321 of the revised title giving the Commission the authority to carry out the subtitle and to prescribe regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(3)(A), the word &ldquo;organization&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;conference, bureau, committee, or other organization&rdquo; as being more inclusive. In subsection (a)(3)(A)(i), 49:5c(5)(a)(i) and (ii) are consolidated to eliminate redundancy. The words &ldquo;of the same mode&rdquo; are omitted as surplus since this subsection applies only to rail carriers. The words &ldquo;under section 10707 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;pursuant to section 15(8) of this chapter&rdquo; to conform to the revised title.</p>

The words &ldquo;will further&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;by reason of furtherance&rdquo; for clarity. The word &ldquo;only&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;otherwise the application shall be denied&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;may require compliance with conditions necessary to make the agreement further that policy as a condition of approval&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;upon such terms and conditions as the Commission may prescribe as necessary to enable it to grant its approval in accordance with the standard above set forth in this paragraph&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1), the reference to rail carriers in a class is retained to reflect the ambiguity resulting from the amendment made by section 208(a) of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) When a new individual or joint rate or individual or joint classification, rule, or practice related to a rate is filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission by a rail carrier providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, the Commission may begin a proceeding, on its own initiative or on complaint of an interested <!-- PDFPage:242 -->party, to determine whether the proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice violates this subtitle. The Commission must give reasonable notice to interested parties before beginning a proceeding under this subsection but may act without allowing an interested party to file an answer or other formal pleading in response to its decision to begin the proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Commission must complete a proceeding under this section and make its final decision by the end of the 5th month after the rate, classification, rule, or practice was to become effective, except that if the Commission reports to the Congress by the end of such 5th month that it cannot make a final decision by that time and explains the reason for the delay, it may take an additional 3 months to complete the proceeding and make its final decision. If the Commission does not reach a final decision within the applicable time period, the rate, classification, rule, or practice&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is effective at the end of that time period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if already in effect at the end of that time period, remains in effect.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an interested party has filed a complaint under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission may set aside a rate, classification, rule, or practice, that has become effective under this section if the Commission finds it to be in violation of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Commission may not suspend a proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice during the course of a Commission proceeding under this section unless it appears from the specific facts shown by the verified statement of a person that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) it is substantially likely that the protestant will prevail on the merits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) without suspension, the proposed rate change will cause substantial injury to the protestant or the party represented by the protestant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) because of the peculiar economic circumstances of the protestant, the provisions of subsection (d) of this section do not protect the protestant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The burden shall be on the protestant to prove the matters described in paragraph (1)(A), (B), and (C) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) If the Commission does not suspend a proposed rate increase under subsection (c) of this section, the Commission shall require the rail carrier to account for all amounts received under the increase until the Commission completes its proceedings under subsection (b) of this section. The accounting shall specify by whom and for whom the amounts are paid. When the Commission takes final action, it shall require the carrier to refund to the person for whom the amounts were paid that part of the increased rate found to be unreasonable, plus interest at a rate equal to the average yield (on the date the statement is filed) of marketable securities of the United States Government having a duration of 90 days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a rate is suspended under subsection (c) of this section and any portion of such rate is later found to be reasonable under this subtitle, the carrier shall collect from each person using the transportation to which the rate applies the difference between the original rate and the portion of the suspended rate found to be reasonable for any services performed during the period of suspension, plus interest at a rate equal to the average yield (on the date the statement is filed) of marketable securities of the United States Government having a duration of 90 days, except that this paragraph shall not apply to general rate increases under section 10706 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If any portion of a proposed rate decrease is suspended under subsection (c) of this section and later found to be reasonable under this subtitle, the rail carrier may refund any part of the portion of the decrease found to comply with this subtitle if the carrier makes the refund available to each shipper who participated in the rate, in accordance with the relative amount of such shipper's traffic transported at such rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 10741 or section 10761 of this title, the Commission shall, by rule, establish standards and procedures permitting a rail carrier to waive the collection of amounts due under this subsection if such amounts are not significant.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) &ldquo;base rate&rdquo; means, with respect to the transportation of a particular commodity (i) for the 24-month period beginning on October 1, 1980, the rate in effect on October 1, 1980, (ii) for the 24-month period beginning on October 1, 1982, the rate in effect on October 1, 1982, and (iii) for the 5-year period beginning on October 1, 1984, and for each subsequent 5-year period, the rate in effect on the first day of the applicable 5-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If no rate exists for the transportation of a particular commodity on October 1, 1980, the base rate for the transportation of such commodity shall be the rate established by the rail carrier (divided by the latest rail cost adjustment factor published by the Commission), unless such rate is found to be unreasonable by the Commission, in which case the base rate shall be the rate authorized by the Commission (divided by the latest rail cost adjustment factor published by the Commission).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) &ldquo;adjusted base rate&rdquo; means the base rate for the transportation of a particular commodity multiplied by the latest rail cost adjustment factor published by the Commission pursuant to this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Commencing with the fourth quarter of 1980, the Commission shall, as often as practicable but in no event less often than quarterly, publish a rail cost adjustment factor which shall be a fraction, the numerator of which is the latest published Index of Railroad Costs (which index shall be compiled or verified by the Commission, with appropriate adjustments to reflect the changing composition of railroad costs, including the quality and mix of material and labor), and the denominator of which is the same index for the fourth quarter of 1980, or for the fourth quarter of 1982 or for the fourth quarter of every fifth year thereafter, as appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may increase any rate over which the Commission has jurisdiction under section 10709 of this title so long as the increased rate is not greater than the adjusted base rate for the transportation involved, plus any rate increases implemented under subsection (c) or (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A rate increase authorized under this subsection may not be found to exceed a reasonable maximum for the transportation involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A rail carrier may not increase a rate under this subsection to the extent that the cost increases to such carrier due to inflation are recovered through (A) general rate increases pursuant to section 10706 of this title, or (B) inflation-based rate increases under section 10712 of this title applicable to that rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) During the 12-month period beginning on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and during each of the 3 succeeding 12-month periods, a rail carrier may, in addition to rate increases authorized under subsection (b) of this section, increase any rate over which the Commission has jurisdiction under section 10709 of this title by an annual amount of not more than 6 percent of the adjusted base rate, except that in no event shall the total increase under this subsection result in a rate which is more than 118 percent of the adjusted base rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If any portion of a rate increase under this subsection is not implemented in the year in which it is authorized, such portion may, except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, be implemented only in the next succeeding year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If any portion of the total rate increase authorized under this subsection is not implemented by the end of the 4-year period beginning on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, such portion may be implemented in the next 2 succeeding years, except that in no event may a rail carrier increase a rate under this subsection or under subsection (d) of this section in either of such 2 succeeding years by an annual amount of more than 10 percent of the adjusted base rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, during the 12-month period beginning on October 1, 1984, and during each succeeding 12-month period, a rail carrier may, in <!-- PDFPage:244 -->addition to rate increases under subsection (b) of this section, increase any rate over which the Commission has jurisdiction under section 10709 of this title by an annual amount of not more than 4 percent of the adjusted base rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No portion of any rate increase under this subsection which is not implemented in the year in which it is authorized may be implemented in any other year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a rail carrier proposing to increase a single line rate if such carrier earns adequate revenues, as determined by the Commission under section 10704(a)(2) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission shall, after a hearing on the record, prescribe such rules with respect to joint rates as necessary to ensure that rail carriers which earn adequate revenues, as determined under section 10704(a)(2) of this title, do not receive the rate increases authorized by this subsection unless the Commission determines that it is unable to prescribe such rules without precluding rail carriers not earning adequate revenues from receiving the rate increases authorized under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 10707 of this title, in the case of any rate increase by a rail carrier that is authorized under subsection (c) or (d) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) the Commission may not suspend such rate increase pending final Commission action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Commission may not begin an investigation proceeding under section 10707 of this title with respect to the reasonableness of such rate increase; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an interested party may file a complaint under section 11701(b) of this title alleging that such rate increase violates the provisions of this subtitle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In considering any complaint challenging a rate increase that is authorized under subsection (c) of this section and that results in a revenue-variable cost percentage that is less than the lesser of the percentages described in clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (2)(A), the Commission shall, in determining the reasonableness of such rate increase, give due consideration to whether the carrier proposing the rate increase has attained adequate revenues, as determined by the Commission under section 10704(a)(2) of this title, giving regard to preventing a carrier with adequate revenues from realizing excessive profits on the traffic involved and also the policy of bringing to an adequate level the revenues of carriers not having an adequate revenue level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If a rate increase authorized under this section in any year results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for the transportation to which the rate applies that is equal to or greater than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) 20 percentage points above the revenue-variable cost percentage applicable in that year under section 10709(d) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a revenue-variable cost percentage of 190 percent,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">whichever is less, the Commission may, on its own initiative, or on complaint of an interested party, begin an investigation proceeding to determine whether the proposed rate increase violates this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In determining whether to investigate or not to investigate any proposed rate increase that results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for the transportation to which the rate applies that is equal to or greater than the lesser of the percentages described in clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (without regard to whether such rate increase is authorized under this section), the Commission shall set forth its reasons therefor, giving due consideration to the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the amount of traffic which is transported at revenues which do not contribute to going concern value and efforts made to minimize such traffic;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount of traffic which contributes only marginally to fixed costs and the extent to which, if any, rates on such traffic can be changed to maximize the revenues from such traffic; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the impact of the proposed rate or rate increase on the attainment of the national energy goals and the rail transportation policy under section 10101a of this title, taking into account the railroads&rsquo; role as a primary source of energy transportation and the need for a sound rail transportation system in accordance with the revenue adequacy goals of section 10704 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">This subparagraph shall not be construed to change existing law with regard to the nonreviewability of such determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In determining whether a rate is reasonable, the Commission shall consider, among other factors, evidence of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the amount of traffic which is transported at revenues which do not contribute to going concern value and efforts made to minimize such traffic;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount of traffic which contributes only marginally to fixed costs and the extent to which, if any, rates on such traffic can be changed to maximize the revenues from such traffic; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the carrier's mix of rail traffic to determine whether one commodity is paying an unreasonable share of the carrier's overall revenues.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) In any proceeding under this section, evidence of the underlying rail carrier rate is admissible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) A finding by the Commission that a rate increase exceeds the increase authorized under this section does not establish a presumption that (1) the rail carrier proposing such rate increase has or does not have market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies, or (2) the proposed rate exceeds or does not exceed a reasonable maximum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The authority of the Commission to determine and prescribe reasonable rules, classifications, and practices may not be used, directly or indirectly, to limit the rates which rail carriers are otherwise authorized to establish under this subtitle.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10708. Investigation and suspension of new nonrail carrier rates, classifications, rules, and practices</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Interstate Commerce Commission may begin a proceeding to determine the lawfulness of a proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice immediately, on its own initiative or on application of an interested party when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a new individual or joint rate or individual or joint classification, rule, or practice affecting a rate is filed with the Commission by a common carrier, other than a rail carrier, under this subtitle; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a new or reduced rate or rule or practice that causes a reduction of a rate is filed with the Commission by a contract carrier under this subtitle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission must give reasonable notice before beginning a proceeding under this section but may act without allowing an interested carrier to file an answer or other formal pleading in response to its decision to begin the proceeding. The Commission may take whatever final action on a rate, classification, rule, or practice under this section, after a full hearing (whether completed before or after the rate, classification, rule, or practices goes into effect), as it could in a proceeding begun after a rate, �7E�7Eclassification, �7E�7Erule, �7E�7Eor �7E�7Epractice �7E�7Ebecame effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Pending final Commission action in a proceeding under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission may suspend the proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice at any time for not more than 7 months beyond the time it would otherwise go into effect by (1) delivering to each affected carrier, and (2) filing with the proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice, a statement of reasons for the suspension. If the Commission does not take final action during the suspension period, the proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice is effective at the end of that period. However, if an increase in a rate for, or related to, transportation of property by an express, sleeping car, or pipeline carrier becomes effective under this subsection, the Commission may require the interested carrier to account for all amounts received under it and specify by whom and on whose behalf those amounts were paid. When the Commission takes final action, it may require the carrier to refund, with interest, to the persons on whose behalf those amounts were paid, the part of the increased rate found to be in violation of this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In a proceeding under this section, the burden is on the carrier proposing the changed rate, classification, rule, or practice to prove that the change is reasonable. The Commission shall give proceedings under this section preference over all other proceedings related to that type of carrier pending before it and make its decision at the earliest practical time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the Commission may not investigate, suspend, revise, or revoke any rate proposed by a motor common carrier of property or household goods freight forwarder on the grounds that such rate is unreasonable on the basis that it is too high or too low if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the carrier notifies the Commission that it wishes to have the rate considered pursuant to this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the aggregate of increases and decreases in any such rate is not more than 10 percent above the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate, nor more than 10 percent below the lesser of the rate in effect on July 1, 1980 (or, in the case of any rate which a carrier first establishes after July 1, 1980, for a service not provided by such carrier on such date, such rate on the date such rate first becomes effective), or the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission, by rule, may increase the percentages specified in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection for any group of motor common car<!-- PDFPage:246 -->riers of property or household goods freight forwarders if it finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there is sufficient actual and potential competition to regulate rates; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) there are benefits to (i) carriers or household goods freight forwarders, (ii) shippers, and (iii) the public from further rate flexibility;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that the Commission may not increase such percentages by more than 5 percentage points during any one-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In determining, pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, whether the aggregate of increases and decreases in a proposed rate that is to take effect on or before the 730th day following the date of enactment of this paragraph is more than 10 percent (or such other percentage as the Commission may establish under paragraph (2) of this subsection) above the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate, general rate increases obtained in the one-year period prior to the effective date of the proposed rate shall not be included in such aggregate, except to the extent that such general rate increases exceed 5 percent of the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a proposed rate that is to take effect after the 730th day following the date of enactment of this paragraph, the percentage which first appears in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection (relating to the upper limit of the zone of ratemaking freedom), or such other percentage as the Commission may establish under paragraph (2) of this subsection in lieu of such percentage, shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the percentage change in the Producers Price Index, as published by the Department of Labor, that has occurred during the one-year period prior to the effective date of the proposed rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the Commission may not investigate, suspend, revise, or revoke any single-line rate proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers, or joint rate proposed by one or more such carriers, applicable to any transportation (other than special or charter transportation) on the grounds that such rate is unreasonable on the basis that it is too high or too low if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the carrier or carriers notify the Commission that they wish to have the rate considered pursuant to this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the aggregate of increases and decreases in any such rate is not more than 10 percent above the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate, nor more than 20 percent below the lesser of the rate in effect on the effective date of this paragraph (or, in case of any rate which the carrier or carriers first establish after such date for a service not provided by the carrier or carriers on such date, such rate on the date such rate first becomes effective), or the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) One year after the effective date of this paragraph, the first and second percentages specified in paragraph (4)(B) of this subsection shall change to 15 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Two years after the effective date, the first and second percentages specified in paragraph (4)(B) of this subsection shall change to 20 percent and 30 percent, respectively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any rate implemented by a carrier pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to the antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12), except that the docketing and publication of such rate by the carrier under section 10706(b) of this title shall not be construed as a violation of the antitrust laws. Evidence that any motor common carrier of passengers established pursuant to this subsection a joint or single-line rate applicable to transportation over any route which is the same as or similar to a joint rate applicable to transportation over such route which such carrier together with one or more other motor common carriers of passengers established pursuant to this subsection shall not be in and of itself sufficient to establish a violation of any such antitrust law.

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, 3 years after the effective date of this subsection, the Commission may not investigate, suspend, revise, or revoke any rate proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers on the grounds that such rate is unreasonable on the basis that it is too high or too low, unless the proposed rate is established collectively in accordance with the procedures of an agreement approved by the Commission under section 10706(b) of this title.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10709. Determination of market dominance in rail carrier rate proceedings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section, &ldquo;market dominance&rdquo; means an absence of effective competition from other carriers or modes of transportation for the transportation to which a rate applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When a rate for transportation by a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title is challenged as being unreasonably high, the Commission shall determine, within 90 days after the start of a proceeding under section 10707 of this title to investigate the lawfulness of that rate, whether the carrier proposing the rate has market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies. The Commission may make that determination on its own initiative or on complaint. A finding by the Commission that the carrier does not have market dominance is determinative in a proceeding under this subtitle related to that rate or transportation unless changed or set aside by the Commission or set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When the Commission finds in any proceeding that a rail carrier proposing or defending a rate for transportation has market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies, it may then determine that rate to be unreasonable if it exceeds a reasonable maximum for that transportation. However, a finding of market dominance does not establish a presumption that the proposed rate exceeds a reasonable maximum. This subsection does not limit the power of the Commission to suspend a rate under section 10707(c) of this title. However, if the Commission has found that a carrier does not have market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies, the Commission may suspend an increase in that rate as being in excess of a reasonable maximum for that transportation only if it specifically changes or sets aside its prior determination of market dominance.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:248 --><p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) In this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) &ldquo;fixed and variable cost&rdquo; means all cost incurred by rail carriers in the transportation of freight, but limiting the return on equity capital to a rate equal to the embedded cost of debt.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) &ldquo;cost recovery percentage&rdquo; means the lowest revenue-variable cost percentage which, if all movements that produced revenues resulting in revenue-variable cost percentages in excess of the cost recovery percentage are deemed to have produced only revenues resulting in the cost recovery percentage, would produce revenues which would be equal, when combined with total revenues produced by all other traffic transported by rail carrier, to the total fixed and variable cost of the transportation of all traffic by rail carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for purposes of determining the cost recovery percentage only, &ldquo;revenue-variable cost percentage&rdquo; means the quotient, expressed as a percentage figure, obtained by dividing the total revenues produced by the transportation of all traffic received by rail carriers for rail transportation by the total variable cost of such transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In making a determination under this section, the Commission shall find that the rail carrier establishing the challenged rate does not have market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies if such rail carrier proves that the rate charged results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for such transportation that is less than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 160 percent during the period beginning on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and ending September 30, 1981;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 165 percent during the period beginning October 1, 1981, and ending September 30, 1982;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) 170 percent during the period beginning October 1, 1982, and ending September 30, 1983;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) 175 percent or the cost recovery percentage, whichever is less, during the period beginning October 1, 1983, and ending September 30, 1984; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the cost recovery percentage, during each 12-month period beginning on or after October 1, 1984.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of subparagraphs (D) and (E) of this paragraph, the cost recovery percentage shall in no event be less than a revenue-variable cost percentage of 170 percent or more than a revenue-variable cost percentage of 180 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of determining the revenue-variable cost percentage for a particular transportation, variable costs shall be determined pursuant to section 10705a(m)(1) of this title, with adjustments specified by the Commission. A rail carrier may meet its burden of proof under this subsection by establishing its variable costs in accordance with such section 10705a(m)(1), but a shipper may rebut that showing by evidence of such type, and in accordance with such burden of proof, as the Commission shall prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A finding by the Commission that a rate charged by a rail carrier results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for the transportation to which the rate applies that is equal to or greater than the applicable percentage under paragraph (2) of this subsection does not establish a presumption that (A) such rail carrier has or does not have market dominance over such transportation, or (B) the proposed rate exceeds or does not exceed a reasonable maximum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Within 180 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and on an annual basis thereafter, the Commission shall determine the cost recovery percentage for the transportation of all traffic received by rail carriers. The Commission shall make such determination after considering each individual revenue-variable cost percentage resulting from the revenues and costs of a valid and reliable statistical sample of all movements of commodities transported by class I rail carriers during the most recent calendar year for which such information is available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If, on the basis of calculations under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Commission determines that revenues earned by all class I rail carriers during the previous calendar year do not exceed the fixed and variable costs of such carriers, then the cost recovery percentage for purposes of this section shall be deemed to be equal to the cost recovery percentage last determined by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Commission shall, in its annual report submitted to the Congress under section 10311 of this title, set forth the cost recovery percentage determined for that year under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Commission may, on a quarterly basis and consistent with the rail transportation policy set forth in section 10101a of this title, prescribe a percentage rate increase or rate index for rail carriers in order to compensate for inflationary cost increases. Such percentage rate increase or rate index may be applicable on an industry-wide, territory-wide, or carrier-by-carrier basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Within 60 days after the date the Commission prescribes a percentage rate increase or rate index under subsection (a) of this section, each rail carrier or group of rail carriers shall notify the Commission of any rate or group of rates which such carrier or carriers intend to be excluded from the application of such percentage rate increase or rate index.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) For purposes of this section, a percentage rate index may permit rate increases within a specified range to allow carriers to recover a total revenue increase specified by the Commission as necessary to compensate for inflationary cost increases.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) One or more rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may enter into a contract with one or more purchasers of rail services to provide specified services under specified rates and conditions. Such a rail carrier may not enter into a contract with purchasers of rail service except as provided in this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:250 --><p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Each contract entered into under this section shall be filed with the Commission, together with a summary of the contract containing such nonconfidential information as the Commission prescribes. The Commission shall publish special tariff rules for such contracts in order to assure that the essential terms of the contract are available to the general public in tariff format.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The essential terms of any contract for the transportation of agricultural commodities to be made available to the general public in tariff format under this subsection shall include, but shall not be limited to (i) the identity of the shipper party to the contract; (ii) the specific origins, transit points and other shipper facilities subject to the contract, and destinations served under such contract; (iii) the duration of the contract, including provisions for optional extension; (iv) the actual volume requirements, if any; (v) whether any transportation service has begun under a contract before the date such contract is filed with or approved by the Commission, and (vi) the date on which the contract became applicable to the transportation services provided under the contract. The Commission shall interpret this subsection to provide for liberal discovery to shippers seeking remedies under subsection (d)(2)(B) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any amendment, supplement, or change to any term or provision of any contract described in subparagraph (A), including extensions of such contract, changes of origin, transit points, affected shipper facilities, destination points, or negotiated economic terms, shall be deemed to be a separate and new contract for the purposes of this subsection. Such amendments, supplements, or changes shall be filed separately with the Commission as provided in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Within 60 days after the date of the enactment of the Conrail Privatization Act, the Commission shall issue regulations which require that essential terms of contracts described in subparagraph (A) shall be made available to the general public in tariff format as provided in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The railroad contract rate advisory service established pursuant to subsection (m) of this section shall assess the impact on competition among agricultural shippers of variations between contract rates for various shipments and the published single car rates, and shall submit a report to the Congress not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of the Conrail Privatization Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A contract filed under this section shall be approved by the Commission, as provided in subsection (e) of this section, unless the Commission determines in a proceeding under subsection (d) of this section that such contract is in violation of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) No later than 30 days after the date of filing of a contract under this section, the Commission may, on its own initiative or on complaint, begin a proceeding to review such contract on the grounds described in this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the case of a contract other than a contract for the transportation of agricultural commodities (including forest products and paper), a complaint may be filed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) by a shipper only on the grounds that such shipper individually will be harmed because the proposed contract unduly impairs the ability of the contracting carrier or carriers to meet their common carrier obligations to the complainant under section 11101 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) by a port only on the grounds that such port individually will be harmed because the proposed contract will result in unreasonable discrimination against such port.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a contract for the transportation of agricultural commodities (including forest products and paper), in addition to the grounds for a complaint described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, a complaint may be filed by a shipper on the grounds that such shipper individually will be harmed because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the rail carrier has unreasonably discriminated by refusing to enter into a contract with such shipper for rates and services for the transportation of the same type of commodity under similar conditions to the contract at issue, and that shipper was ready, willing, and able to enter into such a contract at a time essentially contemporaneous with the period during which the contract at issue was offered; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the proposed contract constitutes a destructive competitive practice under this subtitle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In making a determination under clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the Commission shall consider the difference between contract rates and published single car rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;unreasonable discrimination&rdquo; has the same meaning as such term has under section 10741 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Within 30 days after the date a proceeding is commenced under paragraph (1) of this subsection, or within such shorter time period after such date as the Commission may establish, the Commission shall determine whether the contract that is the subject of such proceeding is in violation of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission determines, on the basis of a complaint filed under paragraph (2)(B)(i) of this subsection, that the grounds for a complaint described in such paragraph have been established with respect to a carrier, the Commission shall, subject to the provisions of this section, order such carrier to provide rates and service substantially similar to the contract at issue with such differentials in terms and conditions as are justified by the evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Approval of a contract filed under this section shall be effective&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on the date the Commission expressly approves such contract, but in no event before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date such contract is filed or after the end of the 60-day period beginning on such date; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the Commission has not disapproved such contract by the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date such contract is filed, at the end of such 60-day period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Commission may limit the right of a rail carrier to enter into future contracts under this section following a determination that ad<!-- PDFPage:251 -->ditional contracts would impair the ability of the rail carrier to fulfill its common carrier obligations under section 11101 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Commission may not require a rail carrier to violate the terms of a contract that has been approved under this section, except to the extent necessary to comply with section 11128 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) A party to a contract entered into under this section shall have no duty in connection with services provided under such contract other than those duties specified by the terms of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) A contract that is approved by the Commission under this section, and transportation under such contract, shall not be subject to this subtitle, and may not be subsequently challenged before the Commission or in any court on the grounds that such contract violates a provision of this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The exclusive remedy for any alleged breach of a contract entered into under this section shall be an action in an appropriate State court or United States district court, unless the parties otherwise agree.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) The provisions of this section shall not affect the status of any lawful contract between a rail carrier and one or more purchasers of rail service that is in effect on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980. Any such contract shall hereafter have the same force and effect as if it had been entered into in accordance with the provisions of this section. Nothing in this section shall affect the rights of the parties to challenge the existence of such a contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) Any rail carrier may, in accordance with the terms of this section, enter into contracts for the transportation of agricultural commodities (including forest products, but not including wood pulp, wood chips, pulpwood or paper) involving the utilization of carrier owned or leased equipment not in excess of 40 percent of the capacity of such carrier's owned or leased equipment by major car type (plain boxcars, covered hopper cars, gondolas and open top hoppers, coal cars, bulkhead flatcars, pulpwood rackcars, and flatbed equipment, including TOFC/COFC), except that in the case of a proposed contract between a class I carrier and a shipper originating an average of 1,000 cars or more per year during the prior 3-year period by major car type on a particular carrier, not more than 40 percent of carrier owned or leased equipment utilized on the average during the prior 3-year period may be used for such contract without prior authorization by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may, on request of a rail carrier or other party or on its own initiative, grant such relief from the limitations of paragraph (1) of this subsection as the Commission considers appropriate, if it appears that additional equipment may be made available without impairing the rail carrier's ability to meet its common carrier obligations under section 11101 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) Service under a contract approved under this section shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct class of service, and the equipment used in the fulfillment of such a contract shall not be subject to car service decisions under section 11123 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) The Commission shall establish a railroad contract rate advisory service. The advisory service shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) compile and disseminate to interested parties nonconfidential summaries of the provisions of individual contract information relating to the provisions of contracts entered into under this section with regard to various goods, items, and commodities covered by such contracts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide the Commission and interested parties with advice regarding contracts; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) assess the impact on competition among shippers of variations between contract rates for various shipments and the published single car rates, and submit a report on such impact to the Congress not later than 90 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Except as provided in this section, the full applicable commercial rate shall be paid for transportation for the United States Government by a common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under this subtitle. Section 3709 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5) does not apply when transportation for the United States Government can be obtained from a common carrier lawfully operating in the area where the transportation will be provided. When prescribing rates for transportation or service by those common carriers, the Commission shall consider increased revenues those carriers receive under this subsection to reflect those increases in appropriate readjustments of their rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection does not apply, and the law related to compensation for <!-- PDFPage:252 -->transportation for the United States Government in effect immediately before September 18, 1940, applies to a rail carrier if that carrier, or its predecessor in interest, received a grant of land from the United States to aid in constructing the railroad it operates but did not file a release with the Secretary of the Interior before September 18, 1941, of claims against the United States Government to, or arising out of, lands that were granted, claimed to have been granted, or claimed should have been granted to that carrier or its predecessor in interest. This paragraph does not require a rail carrier to reconvey to the United States land patented or certified to it or prevent the patent of land that the Secretary of the Interior found was sold by the carrier to an innocent purchaser for value or as preventing the patent of land listed or selected by the carrier and finally approved by the Secretary of the Interior to the extent that issuance of those patents is authorized by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) A common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I, II, or III of chapter 105 of this title may transport individuals for the United States Government without charge or at reduced rates. The carriers may transport custom inspectors and immigration officers without charge. A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under chapter 105 of this title shall provide transportation for the United States Postal Service under chapters 50 and 52 of title 39, and may transport property for the United States Government, a State, or municipal government without charge or at reduced rates; except that any rates for the transportation of household goods for the United States Government shall not be predatory.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Unless a carrier is advised by the United States Government that disclosure of a quotation or tender of a rate established under paragraph (1) of this subsection for transportation provided to the United States Government would endanger the national security, the carrier shall file the quoted or tendered rate, including a retroactive rate made after the transportation has been provided, concurrently, with the Commission and the department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government for which the quotation or tender was made or for which the proposed transportation is to be provided. A carrier may quote or tender a rate established under an agreement made and approved under section 10706 of this title, but the exemption from the antitrust laws provided by that section applies only when the filing requirements of this paragraph are met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this subsection shall limit the Commission's authority to suspend and investigate proposed rates for the transportation of household goods for the United States Government on the basis that such rates constitute predatory practices in contravention of the transportation policy set forth in section 10101(a) of this title. However, pending final Commission action in a proceeding under section 10708 of this title to determine whether a proposed rate for the transportation of household goods for the United States Government under this subsection is predatory or not, the Commission may suspend the proposed rate under subsection (b) of such section 10708 only if it appears from specific facts shown by the verified complaint of a person that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) without suspension, the proposed rate will cause substantial injury to the complainant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it is likely that the complainant will prevail on the merits.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A different policy, rule of rate making, system of accounting, method of determining costs of transportation, value of property, or rate of return may not be applied to a water carrier owned or controlled by the United States Government than is applied to a water carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter III of chapter 105 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before a carrier or freight forwarder may establish a rate for any service under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Commission may require such carrier or freight forwarder to have in effect and keep in effect, during any period such rate is in effect under such paragraph, a rate for such service which does not limit the liability of the carrier or freight forwarder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may establish rates for transportation of property under which the liability of the carrier for such property is limited to a value established by written declaration of the shipper or by a written agreement between the shipper and the carrier, and may provide in such written declaration or agreement for specified amounts to be deducted from any claim against the carrier for loss or damage to the property or for delay in the transportation of such property.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;recyclable material&rdquo; means material collected or recovered from waste for a commercial or industrial use whether the collection or recovery follows end usage as a product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;virgin material&rdquo; means raw material, including previously unused metal or metal ore, woodpulp or pulpwood, textile fiber or material, or other resource that, through the application of technology, is or will become a source of raw material for commercial or industrial use.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When appropriate, the Interstate Commerce Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:261 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) investigate the rate structure for the transportation of recyclable or recycled materials and competing virgin material by rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title and the manner in which that rate structure has been affected by successive general rate increases approved by the Commission for those carriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) determine whether those rate increases affect any part of the rate structure in violation of section 10701 or 10741 of this title and order the rate found to be in violation of either of those sections removed from the rate structure; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) report to the President and Congress, in each of the annual reports of the Commission for 1978 and 1979, and in other appropriate reports, all proceedings started or completed under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A determination under subsection (b)(2) of this section may be made only after a public hearing. During the hearing, the rail carriers have the burden of proving that rate increases that affect the rate structure applicable to the transportation of those competing materials comply with sections 10701 and 10741 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In cooperation with the Commission, the Secretary of Transportation shall maintain a research, development, and demonstration program to develop and improve transport terminal operations, transport service characteristics, transport equipment, and collection and processing methods to facilitate the competitive and efficient transportation of recyclable or recycled materials by rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle or any other law, within 90 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, all rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title shall take all actions necessary to reduce and thereafter maintain rates for the transportation of recyclable or recycled materials, other than recyclable or recycled iron or steel, at revenue-to-variable cost ratio levels that are equal to or less than the average revenue-to-variable cost ratio that rail carriers would be required to realize, under honest, economical, and efficient management, in order to cover total operating expenses, including depreciation and obsolescence, plus a reasonable and economic profit or return (or both) on capital employed in the business sufficient to attract and retain capital in amounts adequate to provide a sound transportation system in the United States. As long as any such rate equals or exceeds such average revenue-to-variable cost ratio established by the Commission, such rate shall not be required to bear any further rate increase. The Commission shall have jurisdiction to issue all orders necessary to enforce the requirements of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any rate established under this subsection must be available on a nonpreferential basis to shippers and must not result in charges to shippers which are predatory.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title may, subject to the provisions of this chapter (including the general tariff requirements of section 10762 of this title), establish rates for the transportation of household goods which guarantee that the carrier will pick up and deliver such household goods at the times specified in the contract for such services and provide a penalty or per diem payment in the event the carrier fails to pick up or deliver such household goods at the specified time. The charges, if any, for such guarantee and penalty provision may vary to reflect one or more options available to meet a particular shipper's needs but must be contained in the tariff the carrier publishes for such service under this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before a carrier may establish a rate for any service under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Commission may require such carrier to have in effect and keep in effect, during any period such rate is in effect under such paragraph, a rate for such service which does not guarantee the pick up and delivery of household goods at the times specified in the contract for such services and which does not provide a penalty or per diem payment in the event the carrier fails to pick up or deliver household goods at the specified time.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may not charge or receive from a person a different compensation (by using a special rate, rebate, drawback, or another means) for a service rendered, or to be rendered, in transportation the carrier may perform under this subtitle than it charges or receives from another person for performing a like and contemporaneous service in the transportation of a like kind of traffic under substantially similar circumstances. A common carrier that charges or receives such a different compensation for that service unreasonably discriminates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under chapter 105 of this title may not subject a person, place, port, or type of traffic to unreasonable discrimination. However, subject to subsection (c) of this section, this subsection does not apply to discrimination against the traffic of another carrier providing transportation by any mode.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission <!-- PDFPage:263 -->under subchapter I, II, or III of that chapter may not subject a household goods freight forwarder providing service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter IV of that chapter to unreasonable discrimination whether or not the household goods freight forwarder is controlled by that carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Differences between the rates, classifications, rules, and practices of water and rail common carriers in effect for their respective types of transportation do not constitute a violation of this section or an unfair or destructive competitive practice under this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Differences between rates, classifications, rules, and practices of rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title do not constitute a violation of this section if such differences result from different services provided by rail carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) This section shall not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) contracts approved under section 10713 of this title, other than as provided in subsection (d)(2)(A)(ii) and (d)(2)(B) of such section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) surcharges or cancellations under section 10705a of this title;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Liability for payment of rates for transportation for a shipment of property by a shipper or consignor to a consignee other than the shipper or consignor, is determined under this subsection when the transportation is provided by a rail, motor, or water common carrier under this subtitle. When the shipper or consignor instructs the carrier transporting the property to deliver it to a consignee that is an agent only, not having beneficial title to the property, the consignee is liable for rates billed at the time of delivery for which the consignee is otherwise liable, but not for additional rates that may be found to be due after delivery if the consignee gives written notice to the delivering carrier before delivery of the property&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) of the agency and absence of beneficial title; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:265 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) of the name and address of the beneficial owner of the property if it is reconsigned or diverted to a place other than the place specified in the original bill of lading.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the consignee is liable only for rates billed at the time of delivery under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the shipper or consignor, or, if the property is reconsigned or diverted, the beneficial owner, is liable for those additional rates regardless of the bill of lading or contract under which the property was transported. The beneficial owner is liable for all rates when the property is reconsigned or diverted by an agent but is refused or abandoned at its ultimate destination if the agent gave the carrier in the reconsignment or diversion order a notice of agency and the name and address of the beneficial owner. A consignee giving the carrier, and a reconsignor or diverter giving a rail carrier, erroneous information about the identity of the beneficial owner of the property is liable for the additional rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Liability for payment of rates for transportation for a shipment of property by a shipper or consignor, named in the bill of lading as consignee, is determined under this subsection when the transportation is provided by a rail or express carrier under this subtitle. When the shipper or consignor gives written notice, before delivery of the property, to the line-haul carrier that is to make ultimate delivery&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to deliver the property to another party identified by the shipper or consignor as the beneficial owner of the property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that delivery is to be made to that party on payment of all applicable transportation rates;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">that party is liable for the rates billed at the time of delivery and for additional rates that may be found to be due after delivery if that party does not pay the rates required to be paid under clause (2) of this subsection on delivery. However, if the party gives written notice to the delivering carrier before delivery that the party is not the beneficial owner of the property and gives the carrier the name and address of the beneficial owner, then the party is not liable for those additional rates. A shipper, consignor, or party to whom delivery is made that gives the delivering carrier erroneous information about the identity of the beneficial owner, is liable for the additional rates regardless of the bill of lading or contract under which the property was transported. This subsection does not apply to a prepaid shipment of property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A rail carrier may bring an action to enforce liability under subsection (a) of this section. That carrier must bring the action during the period provided in section 11706(a) of this title or by the end of the 6th month after final judgment against it in an action against the consignee, or the beneficial owner named by the consignee or agent, under that section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A water common carrier may bring an action to enforce liability under subsection (a) of this section. That carrier must bring the action by the end of the 2d year after the claim accrues or by end of the 6th month after final judgment against it in an action against the consignee or beneficial owner named by the consignee by the end of that 2-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A rail or express carrier may bring an action to enforce liability under subsection (b) of this section. That carrier must bring the action during the period provided in section 11706(a) of this title or by the end of the 6th month after final judgment against it in an action against the shipper, consignor, or other party under that section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) A carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under chapter 105 of this title (except a motor common carrier) shall publish and file with the Commission tariffs containing the rates and (A) if a common carrier, classifications, rules, and practices related to those rates, and (B) if a contract carrier, rules and practices related to those rates, established under this chapter for transportation or service it may provide under this subtitle. A motor common carrier (excluding a motor common carrier providing transportation of property, other than household goods, under an individually determined rate, classification, rule, or practice, as defined in section 10102(13), or in noncontiguous domestic trade) shall publish and file with the Commission tariffs containing the rates for transportation it may provide under this subtitle. The Commission may prescribe other information that motor common carriers (excluding a motor common carrier providing transportation of property, other than household goods, under an individually determined rate, classification, rule, or practice, as defined in section 10102(13), or in noncontiguous domestic trade) shall include in their tariffs. A motor contract carrier of property is not required to publish or file actual or minimum rates under this subtitle. Except as provided in the Negotiated Rates Act of 1993 and the amendments made by that Act, nothing in the Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act of 1994 (and the amendments made by that Act) creates any obligation for a shipper based solely on a rate that was on file with the Commission or elsewhere on the date of enactment of such Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Carriers that publish tariffs under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall keep them open for public inspection. A rate contained in a tariff filed by a common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II, III, or IV of chapter 105 shall be stated in money of the United States. A tariff filed by a motor or water contract carrier or by a household goods freight forwarder providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II, III, or IV of that chapter, respectively, may not become effective for 30 days after it is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A motor common carrier of property (other than a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods or in noncontiguous domestic trade) shall provide to the shipper, on request of the shipper, a written or electronic copy of the rate, classification, rules, and practices, upon which any rate agreed to between the shipper and carrier may have been based. When the applicability or reasonableness of the rates and related provisions billed by a motor common carrier is challenged by the person paying the freight charges, the Commission shall determine whether such rates and provisions are reasonable or applicable based on the record before it. In those cases where a motor common carrier (other than a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods or in noncontiguous domestic trade) seeks to collect charges in addition to those billed and collected which are contested by the payor, the carrier may request that the Commission determine whether any additional charges over those <!-- PDFPage:271 -->billed and collected must be paid. A carrier must issue any bill for charges in addition to those originally billed within 180 days of the original bill in order to have the right to collect such charges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If a shipper seeks to contest the charges originally billed, the shipper may request that the Commission determine whether the charges originally billed must be paid. A shipper must contest the original bill within 180 days in order to have the right to contest such charges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Any tariff on file with the Commission on the date of enactment of the Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act of 1994 not required to be filed with the Commission after the enactment of that Act is null and void beginning on that date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Commission shall prescribe the form and manner of publishing, filing, and keeping tariffs open for public inspection under this section. The Commission may prescribe specific charges to be identified in a tariff published by a common carrier providing transportation or service subject to its jurisdiction under subchapter I, III, or IV of that chapter, but those tariffs must identify plainly&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the places between which property and passengers will be transported;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) terminal, storage, and icing charges (stated separately) if a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of that chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) terminal charges if a common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter III or IV of that chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) privileges given and facilities allowed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) any rules that change, affect, or determine any part of the published rate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A joint tariff filed by a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of that chapter shall identify the carriers that are parties to it. The carriers that are parties to a joint tariff, other than the carrier filing it, must file a concurrence or acceptance of the tariff with the Commission but are not required to file a copy of the tariff. The Commission may prescribe or approve what constitutes a concurrence or acceptance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) When a common carrier (excluding a motor common carrier providing transportation of property other than household goods, under an individually determined rate, classification, rule, or practice defined in section 10102(13), or in a noncontiguous domestic trade) providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission (A) under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title proposes to change a rate, or (B) under another subchapter of that chapter proposes to change a rate, classification, rule, or practice, the carrier shall publish, file, and keep open for public inspection a notice of the proposed change as required under subsections (a) and (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When a contract carrier (except a motor contract carrier of property) providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II or III of chapter 105 of this title proposes to establish a new rate or to reduce a rate, directly or by changing a rule or practice related to the rate or the value of service under the rate, the carrier shall publish, file, and keep open for public inspection a notice of the new or reduced rate as required under subsections (a) and (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A notice filed under this subsection shall plainly identify the proposed change or new or reduced rate and indicate its proposed effective date. In the case of a carrier other than a rail carrier and motor common carrier of passengers with respect to special or charter transportation, a proposed rate change or a new or reduced rate may not become effective for 30 days after the notice is published, filed, and held open as required under subsections (a) and (b) of this section. In the case of a rail carrier, a proposed rate change resulting in an increased rate or a new rate shall not become effective for 20 days after the notice is published and a proposed rate change resulting in a reduced rate shall not become effective for 10 days after the notice is published, except that a contract authorized under section 10713 of this title shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of such section. In the case of a motor common carrier of passengers, a proposed rate change resulting in an increased rate or a new rate applicable to special or charter transportation shall not become effective for 30 days after the notice is published, and a proposed rate change resulting in a reduced rate applicable to special or charter transportation shall not become effective for 10 days after the notice is published.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Commission may reduce the notice period of subsections (a) and (c) of this section if cause exists. The Commission may change the other requirements of this section if cause exists in particular instances or as they apply to special circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may prescribe regulations for the simplification of tariffs by carriers providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title and permit them to change rates, classifications, rules, and practices without filing complete tariffs that cover matter that is not being changed when the Commission finds that action to be consistent with the public interest. Those carriers may publish new tariffs that incorporate changes or plainly indicate the proposed changes in the tariffs then in effect and kept open for public inspection. However, the Commission shall require that all rates of rail carriers and rail rate-making associations be incorporated in their individual tariffs by the end of the 2d year after initial publication of the rate, or by the end of the 2d year after a change in a rate becomes effective, whichever is later. The Commission may extend those periods if cause exists, but if it does, it must send a notice of the extension and a statement of the reasons for the extension to Congress. A rate not incorporated in an individual tariff as required by the Commission is void.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Commission may reject a tariff submitted to it by a common carrier under this section if that tariff violates this section or regulation of the Commission carrying out this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:272 --><p class="statutory-body">(f) The Commission may grant relief from this section to contract carriers when relief is consistent with the public interest and the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title. The Commission may begin a proceeding under this subsection on application of a contract carrier or group of contract carriers and on its own initiative for a water contract carrier or group of water contract carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Commission shall streamline and simplify, to the maximum extent practicable, the filing requirements applicable under this section to motor common carriers of property with respect to transportation provided under certificates to which the provisions of section 10922(b)(4)(E)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10762_1_target" name="10762_1">1</a></sup> of this title apply and to motor contract carriers of property with respect to transportation provided under permits to which the provisions of section 10923(b)(5)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10762_1_target" name="10762_1">1</a></sup> of this title apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Customer Account Codes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No tariff filed by a motor carrier of property with the Commission before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this subsection may be held invalid solely on the basis that a numerical or alpha account code is used in such tariff to designate customers or to describe the applicability of rates. For transportation performed on and after the 180th day following such date of enactment, the name of the customer for each account code must be set forth in the tariff (other than the tariff of a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Range Tariffs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No tariff filed by a motor carrier of property with the Commission before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this subsection may be held invalid solely on the basis that the tariff does not show a specific rate or discount for a specific shipment if the tariff is based on a range of rates or discounts for specific classes of shipments. For transportation performed on or after the 180th day following such date of enactment, such a range tariff must identify the specific rate or discount from among the range of rates or discounts contained in such range tariff which is applicable to each specific shipment or must contain an objective means for determining the rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Nothing in this section shall affect the application of the provisions of the Negotiated Rates Act of 1993 (or the amendments made by that Act) to undercharge claims for transportation provided prior to the date of enactment of the Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act of 1994.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) When a person delivers property to a rail carrier for transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, the person may direct the carrier to transport the property over an established through route. When competing rail lines constitute a part of the route, the person shipping the property may <!-- PDFPage:275 -->designate the lines over which the property will be transported. The designation must be in writing. A carrier may be directed to transport property over a particular through route when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there are at least 2 through routes over which the property could be transported;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a through rate has been established for transportation over each of those through routes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the carrier is a party to those routes and rates.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A carrier directed to route property transported under paragraph (1) of this subsection must issue a through bill of lading containing the routing instructions and transport the property according to the instructions. When the property is delivered to a connecting carrier, that carrier must also receive and transport it according to the routing instructions and deliver it to the next succeeding carrier or consignee according to the instructions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If no direction is made under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission may designate the route over which the property may be transported after arrival at the end of the route of one carrier or at a junction with the route of another carrier when the property is to be delivered to another carrier for further transportation. The Commission may act under this subsection when the public interest and a fair distribution of traffic require that action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission may prescribe exceptions to the authority of a person to direct the movement of traffic under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission shall notify the carrier, the Attorney General, and the chief executive officer of each State in which property being valued under this subchapter is located, of the completion of a tentative valuation of that property. The Commission may also notify other parties. The notice must be sent by certified mail and must indicate the valuation established for each of that carrier's classes of property. A valuation of property under this subchapter becomes final if a protest is not filed within 30 days after notice of the tentative valuation of that property is given. When the tentative valuation becomes final under this subsection, the effective date is the date of the tentative valuation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When a carrier files a protest of a tentative valuation, the Commission shall begin a proceeding to consider the protest. If the Commission decides that a tentative valuation should be changed, it may make the necessary changes. The tentative valuation, as changed, becomes final and is effective on the date of the final action of the Commission under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission shall publish final valuations and classifications of property established under this subchapter. A final valuation or classification that has become effective under this subchapter is prima facie evidence of the value of the property in a proceeding under this subtitle and in a judicial proceeding to enforce, enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend an action of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When evidence is introduced at the trial of an action involving a final valuation of property established by the Commission and found by the court to be different from the evidence offered to the Commission during a proceeding under subsection (b) of this section or in addition to that evidence and substantially affecting the valuation, the court shall send a copy of that evidence to the Commission and stay further proceedings in the action. The court may determine the duration of the stay of proceedings. The Commission shall consider the evidence and may change the final valuation established under this subchapter. The Commission shall complete its action and report to the court in the time determined by the court. If the Commission changes the valuation, the court must substitute the valuation as changed for the original valuation and give its judgment on the substituted valuation. If the Commission does <!-- PDFPage:282 -->not change the original valuation, the court must give judgment on the original valuation.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10904. Filing and procedure for applications to abandon or discontinue</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) An application for a certificate of abandonment or discontinuance under section 10903 of this title, and a notice of intent to abandon or discontinue, must be filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title files an application and notice of intent, the notice shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an accurate and understandable summary of the rail carrier's application and the reasons for the proposed abandonment or discontinuance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a statement indicating that each interested person is entitled to recommend to the Commission that it approve, deny, or take other action concerning the application; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) a statement that the line is available for subsidy or sale in accordance with section 10905 of this title, (ii) a statement that the carrier will promptly provide to each interested party an estimate of the subsidy and minimum purchase price required to keep the line in operation, calculated in accordance with section 10905 of this title, and (iii) the name and business address of the person who is authorized to discuss sale or subsidy terms for the carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The rail carrier shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) send by certified mail a copy of the notice of intent to the chief executive officer of each State that would be directly affected by the proposed abandonment or discontinuance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) post a copy of the notice in each terminal and station on each portion of a railroad line proposed to be abandoned or over which all transportation is to be discontinued;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) publish a copy of the notice for 3 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in each county in which each such portion is located;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) mail a copy of the notice, to the extent practicable, to all shippers that have made significant use (as designated by the Commission) of the railroad line during the 12 months preceding the filing of the application; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) attach to the notice filed with the Commission an affidavit certifying the manner in which clauses (A)&ndash;(D) of this paragraph have been satisfied, and certifying that clauses (A)&ndash;(D) have been satisfied within the most recent 30 days prior to the date the application is filed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If no protest is received within 30 days after the application is filed, the Commission shall find that the public convenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment or discontinuance. In such a case, the Commission shall, within 45 days after the application is filed, issue a certificate which permits the abandonment or discontinuance to occur within 75 days after the application is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) If a protest is received within 30 days after the application is filed, the Commission shall, within 45 days after the application is filed, determine whether an investigation is needed to assist in determining what disposition to make of the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Commission decides that no investigation is to be undertaken, the Commission shall, within 75 days after the application is filed, decide whether the present or future public convenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment or discontinuance, taking into consideration the application of the rail carrier and any materials submitted by protestants. If the Commission finds that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment, it shall, within 90 days after the date of application, issue a certificate which permits the abandonment or discontinu<!-- PDFPage:286 -->ance to occur within 120 days after the application is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Commission decides that an investigation should be undertaken under this section, the investigation must be completed within 135 days, and an initial decision must be rendered within 165 days, after the date the application is filed. Thirty days after such decision, the initial decision shall become the final decision of the Commission unless, during the interim, the Commission decides to hear appeals. If an initial decision is appealed and considered by the Commission, the Commission shall issue a final decision within 255 days after the date of application. Whenever the Commission decides upon investigation that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment or discontinuance of rail service, it shall, within 15 days of the final decision, issue a certificate which permits the abandonment or discontinuance to occur within 75 days of the date of the final decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The effective date of any certificate which permits abandonment or discontinuance may be stayed by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of section 10905 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The burden is on the person applying for the certificate to prove that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or permit the abandonment or discontinuance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For applications approved by the Secretary of Transportation as part of a plan or proposal under section 333(a)&ndash;(d) of this title, the Commission shall consider whether any detriment from the abandonment or discontinuance exceeds the transportation benefit from the plan or proposal as a whole.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;potentially subject to abandonment&rdquo; has the meaning given the term in regulations of the Commission. The regulations may include standards that vary by region of the United States and by railroad or group of railroads.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each rail carrier shall maintain a complete diagram of the transportation system operated, directly or indirectly, by the carrier. The carrier shall submit to the Commission and publish amendments to its diagram that are necessary to maintain the accuracy of the diagram. The diagram shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) include a detailed description of each of its railroad lines potentially subject to abandonment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) identify each railroad line for which the carrier plans to file an application for a certificate under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If an application for a certificate is opposed by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a shipper or other person that has made significant use (as determined by the Commission) of the railroad line involved in the proposed abandonment or discontinuance during the 12-month period before the filing of the application for a certificate; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a State or political subdivision of a State in which any part of the railroad line is located;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission may issue a certificate under section 10903 of this title only if the railroad line has been described and identified in the diagram or amendment to the diagram of the rail carrier that was submitted to the Commission at least 4 months before the date on which the application was filed, except that the requirement of such description or identification in such diagram may be waived by the Commission if the application was approved by the Secretary of Transportation as part of a plan or proposal under section 333(a)&ndash;(d) of this title, or the application is filed by a railroad in bankruptcy.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10905. Offers of financial assistance to avoid abandonment and discontinuance</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;avoidable cost&rdquo; means all expenses that would be incurred by a rail carrier in providing transportation that would not be incurred if the railroad line over which the transportation was provided were abandoned or if the transportation were discontinued. Expenses include cash inflows foregone and cash outflows incurred by the rail carrier as a result of not abandoning or discontinuing the transportation. Cash inflows foregone and cash outflows incurred include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) working capital and required capital expenditure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) expenditures to eliminate deferred maintenance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the current cost of freight cars, locomotives, and other equipment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the foregone tax benefits from not retiring properties from rail service and other effects of applicable Federal and State income taxes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;reasonable return&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if a rail carrier is not in reorganization, the cost of capital to the rail carrier, as determined by the Interstate Commerce Commission; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if a rail carrier is in reorganization, the mean cost of capital of rail carriers not in reorganization, as determined by the Commission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Any rail carrier which has filed an application for a certificate of abandonment or discontinuance shall provide promptly to a party considering an offer of financial assistance and shall provide concurrently to the Commission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an estimate of the annual subsidy and minimum purchase price required to keep the line or a portion of the line in operation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) its most recent reports on the physical condition of that part of the railroad line involved in the proposed abandonment or discontinuance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) traffic, revenue, and other data necessary to determine the amount of annual financial assistance which would be required to continue rail transportation over that part of the railroad line; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) any other information that the Commission may deem necessary to allow a potential offeror to calculate an adequate subsidy or purchase offer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When the Commission finds under section 10903 of this title that the public convenience and necessity require or permit abandonment or discontinuance of a particular railroad line, it shall, concurrently with service of the decision upon the parties, publish the finding in the Federal Register. Within 10 days following the publication, any person may offer to pay the carrier a subsidy or offer to purchase the line. Such offer shall be filed concurrently with the Commission. If the offer to subsidize or purchase the line is less than the carrier's estimate provided under subsection (b)(1) of this section, the offer shall explain the basis of the disparity, and the manner in which the offer of subsidy or purchase is calculated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If, within 15 days after the publication required in subsection (c) of this section, the Commission finds that&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:288 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a financially responsible person (including a governmental authority) has offered financial assistance to enable the rail transportation to be continued over that part of the railroad line to be abandoned or over which all rail transportation is to be discontinued; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it is likely that the assistance would be equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the difference between the revenues attributable to that part of the railroad line and the avoidable cost of providing rail freight transportation on the line, plus a reasonable return on the value of the line; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the acquisition cost of that part of the railroad line;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission shall postpone the issuance of a certificate authorizing abandonment or discontinuance in accordance with subsections (e) and (f) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If the carrier and a person offering financial assistance enter into an agreement which will provide continued rail service, the Commission shall postpone the issuance of the certificate for so long as the agreement, or an extension or modification of the agreement, is in effect. If the carrier and a person offering to purchase a line enter into an agreement which will provide continued rail service, the Commission shall approve the transaction and dismiss the application for abandonment or discontinuance. If the carrier and a financially responsible person (including a governmental authority) fail to agree on the amount or terms of the subsidy or purchase, either party may, within 30 days after the offer is made, request that the Commission establish the conditions and amount of compensation. If no agreement is reached within 30 days after the offer is made and neither party requests that the Commission establish the conditions and amount of compensation during that same period, the Commission shall immediately issue a certificate authorizing the abandonment or discontinuance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Whenever the Commission is requested to establish the conditions and amount of compensation under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Commission shall render its decision within 60 days;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) where subsidy has been offered, the Commission shall determine the amount and terms of subsidy based on the avoidable cost of providing continued rail transportation, plus a reasonable return on the value of the line; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) where an offer of purchase has been made in order to continue rail service on the line, the Commission shall determine the price and other terms of sale. In no case shall the Commission set a price which is below the fair market value of the line (including, unless otherwise mutually agreed, all facilities on the line or portion necessary to provide effective transportation services).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The decision of the Commission shall be binding on both parties, except that the person who has offered to subsidize or purchase the line may withdraw his offer within 10 days of the Commission's decision. In such a case, the Commission shall immediately issue a certificate authorizing the abandonment or discontinuance, unless other offers are being considered pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a carrier receives more than one offer to purchase or subsidize, it shall select the offeror with whom it wishes to transact business, and complete the sale or subsidy agreement, or request that the Commission establish the conditions and amount of compensation prior to the 40th day after the date on which notice was published under subsection (c) of this section. If no agreement on subsidy or sale is reached within the 40-day period and the Commission has not been requested to establish the conditions and amount of compensation, any other offeror may request that the Commission establish the conditions and amount of compensation. If the Commission has established the conditions and amount of compensation and the original offer has been withdrawn, any other offeror may accept the Commission's decision within 20 days of such decision, and the Commission shall require the carrier to enter into a sale or subsidy agreement with such offeror, if such sale or agreement incorporates the Commission's decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) No purchaser of a line or portion of line sold under this section may transfer or discontinue service on such line prior to the end of the second year after consummation of the sale, nor may such purchaser transfer such line, except to the carrier from whom it was purchased, prior to the end of the fifth year after consummation of the sale.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Any subsidy provided under this section may be discontinued on notice of 60 days. Unless, within such 60-day period, another financially responsible party enters into a subsidy agreement at least as beneficial to the carrier as that which was or was to be discontinued, the Commission shall, at the carrier's request, immediately issue a certificate authorizing the abandonment or discontinuance of service on the line.</p>

<p class="note-body">In the section, the word &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; is substituted each place for &ldquo;operation or service&rdquo; for consistency and as being more precise because the jurisdictional grant to the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of the revised title is over transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;within the boundaries of a&rdquo; and &ldquo;duly&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The word &ldquo;law&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;constitution or statutes&rdquo; to eliminate redundancy. The words &ldquo;requested&rdquo; and &ldquo;request&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;application or petition .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. filed&rdquo; and &ldquo;such an application or petition&rdquo;, respectively, to provide one word to cover all kinds of forms that may be filed with a governmental authority and to avoid using the word &ldquo;petition&rdquo; in 2 different ways in the subsection. The word &ldquo;permission&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;authority&rdquo; to avoid confusion with the term &ldquo;State authority&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the 2d sentence is restated for clarity to require the Commission to provide 2 different notices and for precision to cover the situation in which no hearing is requested. The words &ldquo;chief executive officer&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Governor&rdquo; for consistency with other provisions of the subtitle.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the word &ldquo;permission&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;authority&rdquo; to avoid confusion with the term &ldquo;State authority&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;require or&rdquo; are inserted for consistency with other provisions of subchapter I of chapter 109 of the revised title. The word &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;unjust and undue&rdquo; for consistency and to eliminate redundancy. See the revision note to section 10101 of the revised title.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;financially responsible person&rdquo; means a person who (A) is capable of paying the constitutional minimum value of the railroad line proposed to be acquired, and (B) is able to assure that adequate transportation will be provided over such line for a period of not less than 3 years. Such term includes a governmental authority but does not include a class I or a class II rail carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;railroad line&rdquo; means (A) during the 3-year period beginning on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, a line of railroad which carried less than 3,000,000 gross ton miles of traffic per mile in the preceding calendar year, and (B) after the end of such 3-year period, any line of railroad.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) When the Interstate Commerce Commission finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) the public convenience and necessity require or permit the sale of a particular railroad line under this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a railroad line is on a system diagram map as required under section 10904 of this title, but the rail carrier owning such line has not filed an application to abandon such line under sections 10903 and 10904 of this title be<!-- PDFPage:292 -->fore an application to purchase such line, or any required preliminary filing with respect to such application, is filed under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an application to purchase such line has been filed, in accordance with regulations required under subsection (k) of this section, by a financially responsible person,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission shall require the rail carrier owning the railroad line to sell such line to such financially responsible person at a price not less than the constitutional minimum value.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the constitutional minimum value of a particular railroad line shall be presumed to be not less than the net liquidation value of such line or the going concern value of such line, whichever is greater, but shall not include the cost of providing a protective arrangement under subsection (j) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) For purposes of this section, the Commission may determine that the public convenience and necessity require or permit the sale of a railroad line if the Commission determines, after a hearing on the record, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the rail carrier operating such line refuses within a reasonable time to make the necessary efforts to provide adequate service to shippers who transport traffic over such line;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the transportation over such line is inadequate for the majority of shippers who transport traffic over such line;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the sale of such line will not have a significantly adverse financial effect on the rail carrier operating such line;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the sale of such line will not have an adverse effect on the overall operational performance of the rail carrier operating such line; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the sale of such line will be likely to result in improved railroad transportation for shippers that transport traffic over such line.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In a proceeding under this subsection, the burden of proving that the public convenience and necessity require or permit the sale of a particular railroad line is on the person filing the application to acquire such line. If the Commission finds under this subsection that the public convenience and necessity require or permit the sale of a particular railroad line, the Commission shall concurrently notify the parties of such finding and publish such finding in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In the case of any railroad line subject to sale under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission shall, upon the request of the acquiring carrier, require the selling carrier to provide to the acquiring carrier trackage rights to allow a reasonable interchange with the selling carrier or to move power equipment or empty rolling stock between noncontiguous feeder lines operated by the acquiring carrier. The Commission shall require the acquiring carrier to provide the selling carrier reasonable compensation for any such trackage rights.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Commission shall require, to the maximum extent practicable, the use of the employees who would normally have performed work in connection with a railroad line subject to a sale under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) In the case of a railroad line which carried less than 3,000,000 gross ton miles of traffic per mile in the preceding calendar year, whenever a purchasing carrier under this section petitions the Commission for joint rates applicable to traffic moving over through routes in which the purchasing carrier may practicably participate, the Commission shall, within 30 days after the date such petition is filed and pursuant to section 10705(a) of this title, require the establishment of reasonable joint rates and divisions over such route.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Any person operating a railroad line acquired under this section may elect to be exempt from any of the provisions of this subtitle, except that such a person may not be exempt from the provisions of chapter 107 of this title with respect to transportation under a joint rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall apply to any line of railroad which was abandoned during the 18-month period immediately prior to the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and was subsequently purchased by a financially responsible person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) If a purchasing carrier under this section proposes to sell or abandon all or any portion of a purchased railroad line, such purchasing carrier shall offer the right of first refusal with respect to such line or portion thereof to the carrier which sold such line under this section. Such offer shall be made at a price equal to the sum of the price paid by such purchasing carrier to such selling carrier for such line or portion thereof and the fair market value (less deterioration) of any improvements made, as adjusted to reflect inflation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Any person operating a railroad line acquired under this section may determine preconditions, such as payment of a subsidy, which must be met by shippers in order to obtain service over such lines, but such operator must notify the shippers on the line of its intention to impose such preconditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) In the case of any railroad line sold pursuant to this section, the Commission shall require the selling carrier to provide a fair arrangement at least as protective of the interests of employees as that established under section 11347 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) The Commission shall, within 60 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, prescribe such regulations and procedures as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>

The President of the United States may extend, beyond such four-year period, such moratorium or impose such a moratorium with respect to any contiguous foreign country or political subdivision thereof which substantially prohibits grants of authority to persons from the United States to provide transportation by motor vehicle for compensation in such foreign country or political subdivision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The President of the United States may remove or modify, in whole or in part, any moratorium imposed under paragraph (1) of this subsection on the issuance of certificates or permits if the President determines that such removal or modification is in the national interest and notifies, in writing, the Congress of such removal or modification before the date on which such removal or modification is to take effect. In any case in which such moratorium applies to a contiguous foreign country or political subdivision thereof which substantially prohibits grants of authority to persons from the United States to provide transportation by motor vehicle for compensation in such foreign country or political subdivision, such removal or modification shall not take effect before the 60th day following the date on which the Congress is notified of such removal or modification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Subject to the provisions of this subparagraph, during a moratorium imposed under paragraph (1) of this subsection with respect to any contiguous foreign country or political subdivision thereof, the Commission may issue certificates of registration under section 10530 of this subtitle to foreign motor carriers and foreign motor private carriers domiciled in such country or political subdivision and to foreign motor carriers and foreign motor private carriers owned or controlled by persons of such country or political subdivision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Subject to clause (iv) of this subparagraph, if the person to be issued the certificate of registration during the moratorium is a foreign motor carrier domiciled in the foreign country or political subdivision or is a foreign motor carrier owned or controlled by persons of the foreign country or political subdivision, such certificate may only authorize such carrier to provide transportation of property (including exempt items) by motor vehicle in a municipality in the United States which is adjacent to the foreign country or political subdivision, in contiguous municipalities in the United States any one of which is adjacent to the foreign country or political subdivision, or in a zone in the United States that is adjacent to, and commercially a part of, the municipality or municipalities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Subject to clause (v) of this subsection, if the person to be issued the certificate of registration during the moratorium is a foreign motor private carrier domiciled in the foreign country or political subdivision or is a foreign motor private carrier owned or controlled by persons of the foreign country or political subdivision, such certificate may only authorize such carrier to provide transportation of property (including exempt items) by motor vehicle in a municipality in the United States which is adjacent to the foreign country or political subdivision, in contiguous municipalities in the United States any one of which is adjacent to the foreign country or political subdivision, or in a zone in the United States that is adjacent to, and commercially a part of, the municipality or municipalities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) If the person to be issued the certificate of registration during the moratorium is a foreign motor carrier domiciled in the foreign country or political subdivision and owned or controlled by persons of the United States, such certificate may only authorize such carrier to provide interstate transportation of property (including exempt items) by motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) If the person to be issued the certificate of registration during the moratorium is a foreign motor private carrier domiciled in the foreign country or political subdivision and owned or controlled by persons of the United States, such certificate may only authorize such carrier to provide interstate transportation of property (including exempt items) by motor vehicle.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 [see 49 U.S.C. 10922(m)(1), (2)] imposed a moratorium on the issuance of certificates or permits to motor carriers domiciled in, or owned or controlled by persons of, a contiguous foreign country. The Act authorized the President to remove the moratorium in whole or in <!-- PDFPage:302 -->part for any country or political subdivision thereof upon determining that such action is in the national interest. Sixty days&rsquo; advance notice to the Congress is required whenever the removal or modification applies to a contiguous foreign country or political subdivision thereof that substantially prohibits the granting of motor carrier authority to persons from the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">I am pleased that an agreement between the United States and Mexico has been concluded to ensure fair and reciprocal treatment for charter and tour bus interests on both sides of the border. The agreement reached, however, does not allow for full access to cross-border and domestic markets. Therefore, the moratorium must reflect the conditions under which operating authority may be issued to Mexican charter and tour companies under the agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, 49 U.S.C. section 10922(<em>l</em>)(2)(A) [now 10922(m)(2)(A)], I hereby make a limited modification to the moratorium imposed by that section and all actions taken by my predecessors under that section on the issuance of certificates or permits to motor carriers domiciled in, or owned or controlled by persons of, a contiguous foreign country.</p>
<p class="note-body">The moratorium is modified only to authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission to grant Mexican motor carriers authority to transport passengers in charter or special operations, in foreign commerce, in round trip or one-way service between Mexico and the United States pursuant to the following restrictions:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. The Mexican motor carrier can conduct cross-border charter or special service in the United States only when the international tour or charter begins in Mexico;</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Tickets or tour packages for such operations cannot be sold in the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The terms of the grants of authority given to Mexican motor carriers will be limited by the life of the agreement with Mexico covering reciprocal cross-border charter and special operations.</p>
<p class="note-body">This action applies only to international charter and tour operations, does not allow for point-to-point service within the United States, and does not authorize companies to conduct cross-border regular route service. This action preserves the status quo with respect to Mexican trucking companies and Mexican companies engaged in regular route service, and will maintain the moratorium on those operations through September 25, 1994, unless earlier revoked or modified.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, you are directed to notify the Congress today on my behalf that, effective 60 days hence, the moratorium will no longer be in effect for Mexican charter and tour bus companies subject to the above stated conditions. Because of this action, the Interstate Commerce Commission will then accept and process expeditiously all applications for operating authority from Mexican owned, controlled, or domiciled charter and tour bus firms. I should note that applications in Mexico by United States charter and tour bus firms will be similarly treated.</p>
<p class="note-body">You are hereby authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 1, 1994, 59 F.R. 653, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Secretary of Transportation</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 [see 49 U.S.C. 10922(m)(1), (2)] imposed a moratorium on the issuance of certificates or permits to motor carriers domiciled in, or owned or controlled by, persons of a contiguous foreign country. The Act authorized the President to remove the moratorium in whole or in part for any country or political subdivision thereof upon determining that such action is in the national interest. Sixty days&rsquo; advance notice to the Congress is required whenever the removal or modification applies to a foreign contiguous country or political subdivision thereof that substantially prohibits the granting of motor carrier authority to persons from the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">As set forth in the Statement of Administrative Action regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that I submitted to the Congress on November 3, 1993, the moratorium with respect to Mexico will be lifted in phases to coincide with the schedule of liberalization in the relevant provisions of the NAFTA. The NAFTA specifically states that the moratorium will not apply to the provision of cross-border charter or tour bus services as of the date of entry into force of the Agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body">This is to give public notice that, pursuant to section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, 49 U.S.C. section 10922(<em>l</em>)(2)(A) [now 10922(m)(2)(A)], on November 3, 1993, I gave the Congress notice of my intention to make a limited modification to the moratorium imposed by that section and all actions taken by my predecessors under that section on the issuance of certificates or permits to motor carriers domiciled in, or owned or controlled by, persons of Mexico. This modification will take effect on January 1, 1994, the 60th day after my notice to the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">The moratorium is modified only to authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission to grant Mexican motor carriers authority to transport passengers in charter or tour bus operations, in foreign commerce, in round-trip or one-way service between Mexico and the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Except as provided in this section and section 10930 of this title, the Interstate Commerce Commission shall issue a permit to a person authorizing the person to provide transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II or III of chapter 105 of this title as a motor contract carrier of household goods or passengers or water contract carrier, respectively, or to provide service subject to that jurisdiction under subchapter IV of chapter 105 as a households&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10923_1_target" name="10923_1">1</a></sup> goods freight forwarder, if the Commission finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the person is fit, willing, and able&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to provide the transportation or service to be authorized by the permit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to comply with this subtitle and regulations of the Commission; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the transportation or service to be provided under the permit is or will be consistent with the public interest and the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Except as provided in this section and section 10930 of this title, the Commission shall issue a permit to a person authorizing the person to provide transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title as a motor contract carrier of property other than household goods if the Commission finds that the person is able to comply with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) this subtitle, the regulations of the Commission, and any safety requirements imposed by the Commission,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the safety fitness requirements established by the Secretary of Transportation in consultation with the Commission pursuant to section 31144 of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the minimum financial responsibility requirements established by the Commission pursuant to section 10927 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In deciding whether to approve the application of a person for a permit as a motor contract carrier of property other than household goods the Commission shall consider any evidence demonstrating that the applicant is unable to comply with this subtitle, the regulations of the Commission, safety requirements of the Commission, or the safety fitness and minimum financial responsibility requirements of subsection (b)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall find any applicant for authority to operate as a motor carrier of property other than household goods under this subsection to be unfit if the applicant does not meet the safety and safety fitness requirements of paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B) of this subsection and shall deny the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A person may protest an application under this subsection to provide transportation only on the ground that the applicant fails or will fail to comply with this subtitle, the regulations of the Commission, safety requirements of the Commission, or the safety fitness or minimum financial responsibility requirements of paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A person must file an application with the Commission for a permit to provide transportation as a contract carrier or to provide service as a households&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10923_2_target" name="10923_2">2</a></sup> goods freight forwarder.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) contain information required by Commission regulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) be served on persons designated by the Commission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to applications under this section for authority to provide transportation as a motor contract carrier of passengers. The requirement that persons issued permits under this section as motor contract carriers of passengers be fit, willing, and able means safety fitness and proof of minimum financial responsibility under section 18&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10923_3_target" name="10923_3">3</a></sup> of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In deciding whether to approve the application of a person for a permit as a motor contract carrier of household goods, the Commission shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the nature of the transportation proposed to be provided;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the effect that granting the permit would have on the protesting carriers if such grant would endanger or impair their operations to an extent contrary to the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the effect that denying the permit would have on the person applying for the permit, its shippers, or both; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the changing character of the requirements of those shippers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) No motor carrier of property may protest an application to provide transportation as a motor contract carrier of household goods filed under this section unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) it possesses authority to handle, in whole or in part, the traffic for which authority is applied;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) it is willing and able to provide service that meets the reasonable needs of the shippers involved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) it has performed service within the scope of the application during the previous 12-month period or has, actively in good faith, solicited service within the scope of the application during such period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it has pending before the Commission an application filed prior in time to the applica<!-- PDFPage:304 -->tion being considered for substantially the same traffic; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Commission grants leave to intervene upon a showing of other interests that are not contrary to the transportation policy set forth in section 10101(a) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) With respect to applications of persons for permits as motor contract carriers of household goods, the Commission may not make a finding relating to the public interest under subsection (a)(2) of this section which is based upon general findings developed in rulemaking proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Commission may not deny any part of an application for a households&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10923_4_target" name="10923_4">4</a></sup> goods freight forwarder permit filed by a corporation controlled by, or under common control with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I, II, or III of chapter 105 of this title, because of the relationship between the corporation and that carrier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 only because the service to be provided by the corporation will compete with service provided by another households&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10923_4_target" name="10923_4">4</a></sup> goods freight forwarder subject to subchapter IV of that chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Each permit issued to a person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide transportation as a motor contract carrier is subject to section 10927(a) of this title and shall specify the transportation to be provided by the carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide transportation as a water contract carrier shall specify the transportation to be provided by the carrier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide service as a households&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10923_4_target" name="10923_4">4</a></sup> goods freight forwarder shall specify the nature or general description about which the service is to be provided, the area in which, and the areas between which, the service may be provided by the households&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10923_4_target" name="10923_4">4</a></sup> goods freight forwarder.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) The Commission may prescribe necessary conditions under which a contract carrier of passengers or household goods or households&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10923_4_target" name="10923_4">4</a></sup> goods freight forwarder provides transportation or service, except that in the case of a motor contract carrier of property, the Commission may not require such carrier to limit its operations to carriage for a particular industry or within a particular geographic area. The Commission may prescribe the conditions when the permit is issued and at any time thereafter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The permit for a motor contract carrier shall specify necessary conditions, including in the case of a motor contract carrier of passengers, the number of persons, for which the carrier may provide transportation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to ensure that the carrier provides transportation as a motor contract carrier and within the scope of the permit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to carry out requirements established by the Commission under this subtitle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Subject to the permit and its conditions, a motor contract carrier may substitute or add to its equipment and facilities as requests for its transportation develop. The Commission may not prescribe a condition preventing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a water contract carrier from substituting or adding contracts within the scope of the permit to satisfy the requirements of business development and public demand; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a water contract carrier or households&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10923_4_target" name="10923_4">4</a></sup> goods freight forwarder from adding to its equipment and facilities, and transportation or service, as the case may be, within the scope of the permit to satisfy the requirements of business development and public demand.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) A motor contract carrier of property may deliver to or receive from a rail carrier a trailer moving in trailer-on-flat-car service at any point on the route of the rail carrier if the motor carrier is authorized to serve the origin and destination points of the traffic.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Interstate Commerce Commission shall issue, subject to section 10927(b) of this title, a license to a person authorizing the person to be a broker for transportation of property (other than household goods) subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title, if the Commission finds that the person is fit, willing, and able&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10927. Security of motor carriers, brokers, and freight forwarders</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Commission may issue a certificate under section 10922 or 10530 or a permit under section 10923 only if the carrier (including a motor private carrier and a foreign motor private carrier) applying for such certificate files with the Commission a bond, insurance policy, or other type of security approved by the Commission, in an amount not less than such amount as the Secretary of Transportation prescribes pursuant to, or as is required by, section 30&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10927_1_target" name="10927_1">1</a></sup> of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, section 18&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10927_1_target" name="10927_1">1</a></sup> of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, and the laws of the State or States in which the carrier is operating, to the extent applicable. The security must be sufficient to pay, not more than the amount of the security, for each final judgment against the carrier for bodily injury to, or death of, an individual resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance, or use of motor vehicles under the certificate or permit, or for loss or damage to property (except property referred to in paragraph (3) of this subsection), or both. A certificate or permit remains in effect only as long as the carrier satisfies the requirements of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A motor carrier and a foreign motor private carrier and foreign motor carrier (as defined under section 10530(a)) operating in the United States when providing transportation between places in a foreign country or between a place in one foreign country and a place in another foreign country shall comply with the requirements of sections 10329 and 10330 that apply to a motor carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title. To protect the public, the Commission may require any such motor carrier to file the type of security that a motor carrier is required to file under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission may require a motor common carrier providing transportation under a certificate to file with the Commission a type of security sufficient to pay a shipper or consignee for damage to property of the shipper or consignee placed in the possession of the motor common carrier as the result of transportation provided under this subtitle. A carrier required by law to pay a shipper or consignee for loss, damage, or default for which a connecting motor common carrier is responsible is subrogated, to the extent of the amount paid, to the rights of the shipper or consignee under any such security.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may issue a broker's license to a person under section 10924 of this title only if the person files with the Commission a bond, insurance policy, or other type of security approved by the Commission to ensure that the transportation for which a broker arranges is provided. The license remains in effect only as long as the broker complies with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Commission may require a household goods freight forwarder providing service under a permit issued under section 10923 of this title to file with the Commission a bond, insurance policy, or other type of security approved by the Commission. The security must be sufficient to pay, not more than the amount of the security, for each final judgment against the household goods freight forwarder for bodily injury to, or death of, an individual, or loss of, or damage to, property (other than property referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection), resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance, or use of motor vehicles by or under the direction and control of the household goods freight forwarder when providing transfer, collection, or delivery service under this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may require a household goods freight forwarder providing service under a permit or a freight forwarder to file with the Commission a bond, insurance policy, or other type of security approved by the Commission sufficient to pay, not more than the amount of the security, for loss of, or damage to, property for which the freight forwarder provides service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Commission may determine the type and amount of security filed with it under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Without regard to subchapter II of chapter 103 of this title and subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, the Interstate Commerce Commission may grant a water carrier temporary authority to provide transportation to a place or in an area having, respectively, no water carrier capable of meeting the immediate needs of the place or area. Unless suspended or revoked, the Commission may grant the temporary authority for not more than 180 days. A grant of temporary authority does not establish a presumption that permanent authority to provide transportation will be granted under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Without regard to subchapter II of chapter 103 of this title and subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, the Commission, pursuant to such regulations as the Commission may issue, may grant a motor carrier temporary authority to provide transportation to a place or in an area having no motor carrier capable of meeting the immediate needs of the place or area. Unless suspended or revoked, the Commission may grant the temporary authority for not more than 270 days. A grant of temporary authority does not establish a presumption that permanent authority to provide transportation will be granted under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall take final action upon an application filed under this subsection no later than 90 days after the date the application is filed with the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Without regard to subchapter II of chapter 103 of this title and subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, the Commission, pursuant to such regulations as the Commission may issue, may grant a motor carrier emergency temporary authority to provide transportation to a place or in an area having no motor carrier capable of meeting the immediate needs of the place or area if the Commission determines that, due to emergency conditions, there is not sufficient time to process an application for temporary authority under subsection (b) of this section. Unless suspended or revoked, the Commission may grant the emergency temporary authority for not more than 30 days, and the Commission may extend such authority for a period of not more than 90 days and, in addition, in the case of a motor carrier of passengers, the Commission may extend such authority for a period of more than 90 days but not more than 180 days if no other motor carrier of passengers is providing transportation to the place or in the area. A grant of emergency temporary authority does not establish a presumption that permanent authority to provide transportation will be granted under this subchapter.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10931. Motor common carriers providing transportation entirely in one State</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A motor common carrier may provide transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title without a certificate issued by the Commission under section 10922 of this title, when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the carrier provides transportation entirely in one State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the carrier is not controlled by, controlling, or under common control with a carrier providing transportation outside the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the carrier has applied for, and has been issued, a certificate of public convenience and necessity by the State authority having jurisdiction to issue such a certificate, permitting the carrier to provide intrastate transportation by motor vehicle; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the intrastate certificate was issued after, and the certificate states that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) notice was given to interested parties through publication in the Federal Register of the filing of the application by the carrier and the desire of the carrier to provide transportation otherwise under the jurisdiction of the Commission within the limits of the certificate issued by the State authority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reasonable opportunity to be heard was given; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the State authority considered and found that the public convenience and necessity require that the carrier be permitted to provide transportation under the jurisdiction of the Commission within limits that do not exceed the scope of the certificate issued by the State authority.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) An interested party that opposed issuing the certificate to a motor common carrier in a proceeding before a State authority may petition the Commission for reconsideration of a decision of the State authority. On reconsideration, the Commission, based on the record before the State authority, may affirm, reverse, or change that decision, but only with respect to the transportation subject to Commission jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission may require, before a motor common carrier provides transportation authorized under this section, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a certified copy of the carrier's intrastate certificate and other appropriate information be filed with the Commission; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the carrier comply with applicable requirements established by the Commission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Commission shall issue a certificate of registration to a motor common carrier authorizing the carrier to provide transportation under this section. The authority granted under the certificate is subject to all other applicable provisions of this subtitle. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and subchapter III of chapter 113 of this title, the certificate of registration may be transferred if it is transferred with the intrastate certificate. Transfer of the intrastate certificate without the certificate of registration revokes the certificate of registration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The certificate of registration issued by the Commission is valid as long as the motor common carrier provides transportation entirely in the State from which it received its intrastate certificate and is not controlled by, controlling, or under common control with, a carrier providing transportation outside the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) On the 180th day after the termination, restriction in scope, or suspension of the intrastate certificate, the authority granted under this section to provide transportation is revoked or likewise restricted unless the intrastate certificate is renewed or reissued or the restriction is removed by that 180th day.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Transportation authorized under this section may be suspended or revoked by the Commission under section 10925 of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10932. Motor carrier savings provisions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Except as specifically provided in a certificate or permit, the holder of a motor carrier certificate or permit issued as the result of an application filed before September 2, 1950, authorizing the carrier to provide transportation in the United States or between the United States and a foreign country (to the extent the transportation is in the United States), may provide the transportation between a place in the United States and a place in a territory or possession of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) without being authorized to do so by the Interstate Commerce Commission; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the same extent and subject to the same conditions of the certificate or permit of the carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) A motor common carrier providing transportation under an intrastate certificate issued by a State and under a certificate of registration issued by the Commission under section 206(a)(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act (76 Stat. 912) that has been in effect since October 15, 1962, may continue to provide transportation otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if the certificate of the State authorizing intrastate transportation is limited to a specified period of time, only for that period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) subject to all other applicable provisions of this subtitle;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) as long as the carrier provides transportation only in the State issuing the intrastate certificate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) as long as the carrier is not controlled by, controlling, or under common control with, a carrier providing transportation outside the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in subchapter III of chapter 113 of this title, the certificate of registration issued by the Commission may be transferred if it is transferred with the intrastate certificate. Transfer of the intrastate certificate without the certificate of registration revokes the certificate of registration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) On the 180th day after the termination, restriction in scope, or suspension of the intrastate certificate, the authority granted under the certificate of registration is revoked or likewise restricted unless the intrastate certificate is renewed or reissued or the restriction is removed by that 180th day. The certificate of registration may be suspended or revoked by the Commission under section 10925 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Under regulations of the Commission, a motor common carrier transporting passengers under a certificate issued by the Commission as the result of an application filed before January 2, 1967, or under a reissuance of the operating authority provided in the certificate, may provide transportation to any place subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title for special and chartered parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Commission may not prescribe a condition for a motor contract carrier permit issued before August 23, 1957, that restricts the authority of the carrier&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to substitute similar contracts within the scope of the permit; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to add contracts within the scope of the permit, unless the Commission, on its own initiative or on petition of an interested carrier, finds that the scope of the transportation to be provided by the motor contract carrier under any such additional contract is not confined to transportation provided by a motor contract carrier as defined after August 21, 1957.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Each motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title shall be responsible for all acts or omissions of any of its agents which relate to the performance of household goods transportation services (including accessorial or terminal services) subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title and which are within the actual or apparent authority of the agent from the carrier or which are ratified by the carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Each motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title shall use due diligence and reasonable care in selecting and maintaining agents who are sufficiently knowledgeable, fit, willing, and able to provide adequate household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services) and to fulfill the obligations imposed upon them by this subtitle and by such carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Whenever the Commission has reason to believe from a complaint or investigation that an agent providing household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services) under the authority of a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title has violated section 11901(k) or 11917 of this title or is consistently not fit, willing, and able to provide adequate household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services), it may issue to such agent a complaint stating the charges and containing notice of the time and place of a hearing which shall be held no later than 60 days after service of the complaint to such agent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such agent shall have the right to appear at such hearing and rebut the charges contained in the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If such person does not appear at the hearing or if the Commission finds that the agent has violated section 11901(k) or 11917 of this title or is consistently not fit, willing, and able to provide adequate household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services), it may issue an order to compel <!-- PDFPage:316 -->compliance with the requirement that the agent be fit, willing, and able. Thereafter, the Commission may issue an order to limit, condition, or prohibit such agent from any involvement in the transportation or provision of services incidental to the transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title if, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, it finds that such agent, within a reasonable time after the date of issuance of a compliance order under this section, but in no event less than 30 days after such date of issuance, has willfully failed to comply with such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Upon filing of a petition with the Commission by an agent who is the subject of an order issued pursuant to the second sentence of paragraph (3) of this subsection and after notice, a hearing shall be held with an opportunity to be heard. At such hearing, a determination shall be made whether the order issued pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection should be rescinded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Any agent adversely affected or aggrieved by an order of the Commission issued under this subsection may seek relief in the appropriate United States court of appeals as provided by and in the manner prescribed in chapter 158 of title 28, United States Code.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10935. Discontinuing bus transportation in one State</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) When a motor common carrier of passengers having intrastate authority under the laws of a State, and interstate authority under a certificate issued under section 10922 of this title, to provide transportation over any route to any point in such State has proposed to discontinue providing transportation over such route to such point or to reduce its level of service over such route to such point to a level which is less than one trip per day (excluding Saturdays and Sundays) and the carrier has requested the department, agency, or instrumentality of such State having jurisdiction over granting such discontinuance or reduction for permission to discontinue such intrastate transportation or to reduce its level of service to a level which is less than one trip per day (excluding Saturdays and Sundays) and the request has been denied (in whole or in part) or such department, agency, or instrumentality has not acted finally (in whole or in part) on the request by the 120th day after the carrier made the request, the carrier may petition the Commission for such permission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When a petition is filed under subsection (a) of this section, the carrier shall certify that he has notified (1) the Governor of the State in which such transportation is provided, (2) the State authority having jurisdiction over granting discontinuances of transportation by motor common carriers of passengers and reductions in levels of service by such carriers, (3) local governments having jurisdiction over areas which would be affected if such petition is granted, and (4) such other interested persons as the Commission may specify by regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Any person (including a department, agency, or instrumentality of a State or local government) may object to the Commission to the granting of permission to any motor common carrier of passengers to discontinue or reduce transportation under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If no person objects under subsection (c) of this section to the granting of permission to discontinue or reduce transportation under this section within 20 days after the carrier files with the Commission the petition for such discontinuance or reduction, the Commission shall grant such permission at the end of such 20-day period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1)(A) Subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, if, within 20 days after a carrier files a petition for permission to discontinue providing intrastate transportation over any route to any point or to reduce its level of service over such route to such point to a level which is less than one trip per day (excluding Saturdays and Sundays), any person objects under subsection (c) of this section to the Commission to the granting of such permission, the Commission shall grant such permission unless the Commission finds, on the basis of evidence presented by the person objecting to the granting of such permission, that such discontinuance or reduction is not consistent with the public interest or that continuing the transportation, without the proposed discontinuance or reduction, will not constitute an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) This paragraph shall apply to intrastate transportation of passengers which is being provided by a motor common carrier of passengers on a route over which such carrier was granted, on or before August 1, 1982, authority to provide interstate transportation of passengers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, if, within 20 days after a carrier files a petition for permission to discontinue providing intrastate transportation over any route to any <!-- PDFPage:317 -->point or to reduce its level of service over such route to such point to a level which is less than one trip per day (excluding Saturdays and Sundays), any person objects under subsection (c) of this section to the Commission to the granting of such permission, the Commission shall grant such permission unless the Commission finds, on the basis of evidence presented by the person objecting to the granting of such permission, that continuing the transportation, without the proposed discontinuance or reduction, will not constitute an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce. For the purposes of this paragraph, continuance of the transportation would not constitute an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce only if discontinuance or reduction of such transportation is not consistent with the public interest and the interstate and intrastate revenues from such service under reasonable pricing practices are not less than the variable costs of providing the transportation proposed to be discontinued or reduced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) This paragraph shall apply to intrastate transportation of passengers which is being provided by a motor common carrier of passengers on a route over which such carrier was granted after August 1, 1982, and before the effective date of this section, or is granted on or after such effective date, authority to provide interstate transportation of passengers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall only grant permission to a carrier to discontinue intrastate transportation over any route to any point under this subsection if such carrier has applied for authority to discontinue its interstate transportation over such route to such point under section 10925(b) of this title and the Commission has granted or will grant such authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If any person objects under subsection (c) of this section to the granting of permission to discontinue or reduce transportation under this section within 20 days after the carrier files with the Commission the petition for such discontinuance or reduction, the carrier, within 15 days after the filing of such objection with the Commission, shall furnish to the Commission and to objecting persons&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an estimate of the annual subsidy required, if any, to continue the service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) traffic, revenue, and other data necessary to determine the amount of annual financial assistance, if any, which would be required to continue the service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such other information as the Commission may require by regulation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall take final action upon such petition not later than 90 days after the date the carrier files such petition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Before a discontinuance or reduction in level of service proposed in a petition filed by a carrier under subsection (a) of this section has become effective, the Commission may order the carrier to continue any part of the intrastate transportation in not to exceed the 165-day period beginning on the date the carrier files such petition with the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) In making a finding under subsection (e)(1) of this section, the Commission shall accord great weight to the extent to which interstate and intrastate revenues received for providing the transportation proposed to be discontinued or reduced are less than the variable costs of providing such transportation, including depreciation for revenue equipment. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the carrier filing a petition for permission to discontinue or reduce service shall have the burden of proving the amount of the interstate and intrastate revenues received for providing the transportation and the variable costs of providing the transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In making a finding under subsection (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section, the Commission shall consider, to the extent applicable, at least&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the national transportation policy of section 10101 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) whether the motor common carrier of passengers has received an offer of, or is receiving, financial assistance to provide the transportation to be discontinued or reduced from a financially responsible person (including a governmental authority); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the case of a petition to discontinue transportation to any point, whether the transportation is the last motor carrier of passenger service to such point and whether a reasonable alternative to such service is available.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) No State or political subdivision thereof and no interstate agency or other agency of two or more States shall enact or enforce any law, rule, regulation, standard, or other provision having the force and effect of law relating to discontinuance or reduction in the level of intrastate service by a motor common carrier of passengers subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title corresponding to an interstate service initiated pursuant to the provisions of section 10922(c)(4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10935_1_target" name="10935_1">1</a></sup> of this title, except to the extent that notice of discontinuance or reduction in service, not in excess of 30 days, may be required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) This section shall not apply to any carrier owned or controlled by a State or local government.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under chapter 105 of this title shall provide the transportation or service on reasonable request. In addition, a motor common carrier shall provide safe and adequate service, equipment, and facilities. A rail carrier shall not be found to have violated this section because it fulfills its commitments under contracts approved under section 10713 of this title before responding to reasonable requests for service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may prescribe requirements for continuous and adequate transportation and service provided by motor common carriers and household goods freight forwarders subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapters II and IV of chapter 105 of this title and for transportation of baggage and express by such motor common carriers of passengers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission may not regulate the duration of, or the amount of compensation payable under, an arrangement between a motor carrier and another party to use, with a driver, a motor vehicle not owned by that carrier to transport property when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the motor vehicle&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to be used is that of (i) a farmer or a cooperative association or a federation of cooperative associations under section 10526(a)(4) or (5) of this title, or (ii) a motor private carrier and it is used regularly in the transportation of property referred to in section 10526(a)(6) of this title, or perishable products manufactured from perishable property referred to in that section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is to be used by the carrier in a single movement or in one or more of a series of movements, loaded or empty, in the general direction of the general area where the motor vehicle is based; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:319 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the motor vehicle to be used has completed a movement exempt under section 10526(a)(6) of this title and is next to be used by that carrier in a loaded movement in any direction or in a movement referred to in clause (1)(B) of this subsection, or both.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission may require terminal facilities, including main-line tracks for a reasonable distance outside of a terminal, owned by a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, to be used by another rail carrier if the Commission finds that use to be practicable and in the public interest without substantially impairing the ability of the rail carrier owning the facilities or entitled to use the facilities to handle its own business. The carriers are responsible for establishing the conditions and compensation for use of the facilities. However, if the carriers cannot agree, the Commission may establish conditions and compensation for use of the facilities under the principle controlling compensation in condemnation proceedings. The compensation shall be paid or adequately secured before a carrier may begin to use the facilities of another carrier under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A rail carrier whose terminal facilities are required to be used by another carrier under this section is entitled to recover damages from the other carrier for injuries sustained as the result of compliance with the requirement or for compensation for the use, or both, as appropriate, in a civil action, if it is not satisfied with the conditions for use of the facilities or if the amount of the compensation is not paid promptly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Commission may require rail carriers to enter into reciprocal switching agreements, where it finds such agreements to be practicable and in the public interest, or where such agreements are necessary to provide competitive rail service. The carriers entering into such an agreement shall establish the conditions and compensation applicable to such agreement, but, if the carriers cannot agree upon such conditions and compensation within a reasonable period of time, the Commission may establish such conditions and compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may require reciprocal switching agreements entered into by rail carriers pursuant to this subsection to contain provisions for the protection of the interests of employees affected thereby.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The regulations and paperwork required of motor common carriers providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title shall be minimized to the maximum extent feasible consistent with the protection of individual shippers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Interstate Commerce Commission may issue regulations, including regulations protecting individual shippers, in order to carry out this subtitle with respect to the transportation of household goods by motor common carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Regulations of the Commission protecting individual shippers shall include, where appropriate, reasonable performance standards for the transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title. In establishing performance standards under this paragraph, the Commission shall take into account at least the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the level of performance that can be achieved by a well-managed motor common carrier transporting household goods;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the degree of harm to individual shippers which could result from a violation of the regulation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the need to set the level of performance at a level sufficient to deter abuses which result in harm to consumers and violations of regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) service requirements of the carriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the cost of compliance in relation to the consumer benefits to be achieved from such compliance; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:323 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the need to set the level of performance at a level designed to encourage carriers to offer service responsive to shipper needs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the Commission's authority to require reports from motor common carriers providing transportation of household goods or to require such carriers to provide specified information to consumers concerning their past performance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Every motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title may, upon request of a prospective shipper, provide the shipper with an estimate of charges for transportation of household goods and for the proposed services. The Commission shall not prescribe specific formulas, forms, methods, or techniques for providing a prospective shipper with such an estimate. The Commission shall not prohibit any such carrier from charging a prospective shipper for providing a written, binding estimate for the transportation and proposed services, nor shall the Commission require the final charges to a shipper to be based on an estimate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any charge for an estimate of charges provided by a motor common carrier to a shipper for transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title shall be subject to the antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission shall issue regulations that provide motor carriers providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title with the maximum possible flexibility in weighing shipments, consistent with assurance to the shipper of accurate weighing practices. The Commission shall not prohibit such carriers from backweighing shipments or from basing their charges on the reweigh weights if the shipper observes both the tare and gross weighings (or, prior to such weighings, waives in writing the opportunity to observe such weighings) and such weighings are performed on the same scale.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title shall make a reasonable distribution of cars for transportation of coal among the coal mines served by it whether the mines are located on its line or are customarily dependent on it for car supply. If the supply of available cars does not equal the requirements of the mines, the carrier shall maintain and apply reasonable ratings of the mines and count each car furnished to or used by a mine for transportation of coal against that mine. However, coal cars supplied by shippers or receivers are deemed not to be a part of the carrier's fleet and are not counted in determining a question about distribution or car count under subsection (b) of this section or section 10102, 10501, 10701&ndash;10703, 10707, 10721(b), 10722(c)&ndash;(d), 10723(a)&ndash;(b)(1), 10724(a), 10741&ndash;10744, 10746, 10749, 10750, 10901, 10902, 10907, 11101, 11103&ndash;11105, 11121&ndash;11125, 11127, 11128(a)(1), 11501(f), 11505(a), 11702(a)(1), 11703, 11901(d)&ndash;(e)(2), 11902, 11903, 11905, 11907, 11915, or 11916 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;unit-train service&rdquo; means the movement of a single shipment of coal of at least 4,500 tons, tendered to one carrier, on one bill of lading, at one origin, on one day, and destined to one consignee, at one plant, at one destination, over one route.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Unit-train service and non-unit-train service are deemed to be separate and distinct classes of service. A distinction shall be made between them and between the cars used in each class of service. A question about the reasonableness of, or discrimination in, the distribution of cars shall be determined within each class and not between them, notwithstanding a section referred to in subsection (a) of this section.</p>

However, when an annual report is made by a motor carrier, a broker, or a lessor or an association maintained by or interested in one of them, the person making the report may elect to make it for the 13-month period accounting year ending at the close of one of the last 7 days of each calendar year if the books of the person making the report are kept by that person on the basis of that accounting year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An annual report shall be filed with the Commission by the end of the 3d month after the end of the year for which the report is made unless the Commission extends the filing date or changes the period covered by the report.

<!-- field-end:head -->

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Within 180 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, each rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title shall file with the Commission a request for preliminary certification of its cost accounting system. The Commission shall grant such preliminary certification if it determines that the cost accounting system of such rail carrier is in compliance with the accounting standards of the Commission in effect on the day prior to the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) As soon as practicable, but not later than 9 months, after the promulgation of rules by the Commission under section 11163 of this title, each rail carrier described in subsection (a) of this section shall file with the Commission a request for final certification of its cost accounting system developed to comply with this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within 90 days, or such additional time as the Commission finds necessary, after a rail carrier files its request for final certification under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Commission shall grant such final certification to such carrier if the Commission determines that the cost accounting system of such carrier is in compliance with the rules promulgated by the Commission under section 11163 of this title. If the Commission denies such final certification, the rail carrier shall revise its cost accounting system and file a new request for certification within 90 days after the date of such denial. The Commission shall thereupon grant final certification if it determines that such cost accounting system, as revised, is in compliance with such rules. If <!-- PDFPage:334 -->the Commission again denies final certification to the rail carrier, the Commission shall prescribe a cost accounting system which such carrier shall adopt within a reasonable time and which shall be considered a finally certified cost accounting system for purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Each rail carrier shall have and maintain a cost accounting system that is in compliance with the rules promulgated by the Commission under section 11163 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Certification under this section that the cost accounting system of a rail carrier is in compliance with the rules promulgated by the Commission under section 11163 of this title shall be valid until the promulgation of new rules by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After the cost accounting system of a rail carrier is certified under this section, such rail carrier may, after notifying the Commission, make modifications in such system unless, within 60 days after the date of notification, the Commission finds such modifications to be inconsistent with the rules promulgated by the Commission under section 11163 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) For purposes of determining whether the cost accounting system of a rail carrier is in compliance with the rules promulgated by the Commission, the Commission shall have the right to examine and make copies of any documents, papers, or records of such rail carrier relating to compliance with such rules. Such documents, papers, and records (and any copies thereof) shall not be subject to the mandatory disclosure requirements of section 552 of title 5.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) To obtain expense and revenue information for regulatory purposes, the Interstate Commerce Commission may promulgate reasonable rules for rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, prescribing expense and revenue accounting and reporting requirements consistent with generally accepted accounting principles uniformly applied to such carriers. Such requirements shall be cost effective and compatible with and not duplicative of the managerial and responsibility accounting requirements of those carriers. To the extent such rules are required solely to provide expense and revenue information necessary for determining railroad costs in regulatory proceedings under this subtitle, such rules shall be promulgated in accordance with the cost accounting principles established by the Railroad Accounting Principles Board under section 11162 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Any reports required by the rules established by the Commission under this section shall include only information considered necessary for disclosure under the cost accounting principles established by the Board or under generally accepted accounting principles or the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;11301. Authority of certain carriers to issue securities and assume obligations and liabilities</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; means a rail or sleeping car carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title (except a street, suburban, or interurban electric railway not operated as a part of a general railroad system of transportation), and a corporation organized to provide transportation by rail carrier subject to that subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;security&rdquo; means a share of capital stock, a bond, or other evidence of interest in, or indebtedness of, a carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Subject to the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.), and the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;1 et seq.), the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction to approve the issuance of securities by a carrier and the assumption of an obligation or liability related to the securities of another person by a carrier. A carrier may not issue securities or assume those obligations or liabilities without the approval of the Commission. No other approval is required. A security issued or obligation or liability assumed by a carrier in violation of this subsection or in violation of a condition prescribed by the Commission under subsection (d) of this section is void. However, a security or obligation issued or assumed under authority of this section is not void for failure to comply with a procedural requirement of this section or other matter preceding entry of the order of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection does not apply to notes issued by a carrier if the notes mature not more than 2 years after their date of issue and total (with all then outstanding notes having a maturity of not more than 2 years) not more than 5 percent of the par value of the then outstanding securities of that carrier. If the securities do not have a par value, the par value of those securities is the fair market value on the date of issue. Paragraph (1) of this subsection applies to a subsequent funding of notes referred to in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A carrier issuing notes referred to in subsection (b)(2) of this section shall file a certificate of notification with the Commission by the end of the 10th day after they are issued. That notification must include substantially the same matter required by the Commission for an application for authority to issue other securities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A carrier that pledges, repledges, or otherwise disposes of a security referred to in an application for authority or a certificate of notification under this section as pledged or held unencumbered in the treasury of that carrier shall file a certificate of notification with the Commission by the end of the 10th day after it disposes of the security.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Commission may begin a proceeding under this section on application of a carrier. Before taking final action, the Commission must investigate the purpose and use of the securities issue or assumption and the proceeds from it. The Commission may approve any part of the application and may require the carrier to comply with appropriate conditions. After an application is approved under this section, the <!-- PDFPage:336 -->Commission may change a condition previously imposed or use that may be made of the securities or proceeds for good cause shown subject to the requirements of this section. The Commission may approve an application under this section only when it finds that the securities issue or assumption&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is for a lawful object within the corporate purpose of the carrier and reasonably appropriate for that purpose;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is compatible with the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is appropriate for or consistent with the proper performance by the carrier of service to the public as a common carrier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) will not impair the financial ability of the carrier to provide the service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An application or certificate must be made under oath and signed and filed for the carrier by a designated executive officer who knows the matters stated in the application or certificate. On receipt of an application of a carrier under this section, the Commission shall have a copy of the application served on the chief executive officer of each State in which that carrier operates. The appropriate authorities of those States are entitled to be admitted as parties to a proceeding under this section to represent the rights and interests of their people and States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Commission shall require a carrier that issues securities, including notes, under this section to submit reports to it. The reports must identify the disposition of those securities and the application of the proceeds from their disposition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) This section does not imply a guaranty or obligation of those securities by the United States Government. This section does not apply to securities issued or obligations or liabilities assumed by the United States Government, a State, or an instrumentality or political subdivision of one of them.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Notwithstanding sections 11343 and 11344 of this title, a carrier, or a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a rail, express, sleeping car, or pipeline carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may not own, operate, control, or have an interest in a water common carrier or vessel carrying property or passengers on a water route with which it does or may compete for traffic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may decide, after a full hearing, questions of fact related to competition or the possibility of competition under this subsection on application of a carrier. A carrier may file an application to determine whether an existing service violates this subsection and may request permission to continue operation of a vessel or that action be taken under subsection (b) of this section. The Commission may begin a proceeding under this subsection on its own initiative or on application of a shipper to investigate the operation of a vessel used by a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of that chapter if the carrier has not applied to the Commission and had the question of competition or the possibility of competition determined under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the Commission may authorize a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under that subchapter to own, operate, control, or have an interest in a water common carrier or vessel that is not operated through the Panama Canal and with which the carrier does or may compete for traffic when the Commission finds that ownership, operation, control, or interest will still allow that water common carrier or vessel to be operated in the public interest advantageously to interstate commerce and that it will still allow competition, without reduction, on the water route in question. However, section 11343 of this title also applies to a transaction or interest under this subsection if the transaction or interest is within the scope of that section. The Commission may begin a proceeding under this subsection on application of a carrier. An authorization under this subsection is not necessary for a carrier that obtained an order of extension before Sep<!-- PDFPage:340 -->tember 18, 1940, under section 5(21) of the Interstate Commerce Act (37 Stat. 567), as amended, if the order is still in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission may take action under this section only after a full hearing. An order entered as a result of the action may be conditioned on giving security for the payment of an amount of money or the discharge of an obligation that is required to be paid or discharged under that order.</p>

A carrier, corporation, or person participating in that approved or exempted transaction is exempt from the antitrust laws and from all other law, including State and municipal law, as necessary to let that person carry out the transaction, hold, maintain, and operate property, and exercise control or franchises acquired through the transaction. However, if a purchase and sale, a lease, or a corporate consolidation or merger is involved in the transaction, the carrier or corporation may carry out the transaction only with the assent of a majority, or the number required under applicable State law, of the votes of the holders of the capital stock of that corporation entitled to vote. The vote must occur at a regular meeting, or special meeting called for that purpose, of those stockholders and the notice of the meeting must indicate its purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A power granted under this subchapter to a carrier or corporation is in addition to and changes its powers under its corporate charter and under State law.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I, II, or III of chapter 105 of this title may not agree or combine with another of those carriers to pool or divide traffic or services or any part of their earnings without the approval of the Commission under this section or sections 11124 and 11125 of this title. Except as provided in subsection (b) for agreements or combinations between or among motor common carriers of property, the Commission may approve and authorize the agreement or combination if the carriers involved assent to the pooling or division and the Commission finds that a pooling or division of traffic, services, or earnings&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) will be in the interest of better service to the public or of economy of operation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will not unreasonably restrain competition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Any motor common carrier of property may apply to the Commission for approval of an agreement or combination with another motor common carrier of property to pool or divide traffic or any services or any part of their earnings by filing such agreement or combination with the Commission not less than 50 days before its effective date. Prior to the effective date of the agreement or combination, the Commission shall determine whether the agreement or combination is of major transportation importance and whether there is substantial likelihood that the agreement or combination will unduly restrain competition. If the Commission determines that neither of these two factors exists, it shall, prior to such effective date and without a hearing, approve and authorize the agreement or combination, under such rules and regulations as the Commission may issue, and for such consideration between such carriers and upon such terms and conditions as shall be found by the Commission to be just and reasonable. If the Commission determines either that the agreement or combination is of major transportation importance or that there is a substantial likelihood that the agreement or combination will unduly restrain competition, the Commission shall hold a hearing concerning whether the agreement or combination will be in the interest of better service to the public or of economy in operation and whether it will unduly restrain competition and shall suspend operation of such agreement or combination pending such hearing and final decision thereon. After such hearing, the Commission shall indicate to what extent it finds that the agreement or combination will be in the interest of better service to the public or of economy in operation and will not unduly restrain competition and if assented <!-- PDFPage:343 -->to by all the carriers involved, shall, to that extent, approve and authorize the agreement or combination, under such rules and regulations as the Commission may issue, and for such consideration between such carriers and upon such terms and conditions as shall be found by the Commission to be just and reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of an application for Commission approval of an agreement or combination between a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods and its agents to pool or divide traffic or services or any part of their earnings, such agreement or combination shall be presumed to be in the interest of better service to the public and of economy in operation and not to restrain competition unduly if the practices proposed to be carried out under such agreement or combination are the same as or similar to practices carried out under agreements and combinations between motor common carriers providing transportation of household goods to pool or divide traffic or services or any part of their earnings approved by the Commission before the date of enactment of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall streamline, simplify, and expedite, to the maximum extent practicable, the process (including, but not limited to, any paperwork) for submission and approval of applications under this section for agreements and combinations between motor common carriers providing transportation of household goods and their agents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission may impose conditions governing the pooling or division and may approve and authorize payment of a reasonable consideration between the carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) This section affects an agreement or combination filed with the Commission before March 19, 1941, to which a water common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter III of chapter 105 of this title is a party only when the Commission determines that the agreement or combination does not meet the requirements for approval and authorization under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;11343. Consolidation, merger, and acquisition of control</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The following transactions involving carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I (except a pipeline carrier), II, or III of chapter 105 of this title may be <!-- PDFPage:344 -->carried out only with the approval and authorization of the Commission:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consolidation or merger of the properties or franchises of at least 2 carriers into one corporation for the ownership, management, and operation of the previously separately owned properties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a purchase, lease, or contract to operate property of another carrier by any number of carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) acquisition of control of a carrier by any number of carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) acquisition of control of at least 2 carriers by a person that is not a carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) acquisition of control of a carrier by a person that is not a carrier but that controls any number of carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) acquisition by a rail carrier of trackage rights over, or joint ownership in or joint use of, a railroad line (and terminals incidental to it) owned or operated by another rail carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A person may carry out a transaction referred to in subsection (a) of this section or participate in achieving the control or management, including the power to exercise control or management, in a common interest of more than one of those carriers, regardless of how that result is reached, only with the approval and authorization of the Commission under this subchapter. In addition to other transactions, each of the following transactions are considered achievements of control or management:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A transaction by a carrier has the effect of putting that carrier and persons affiliated with it, taken together, in control of another carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A transaction by a person affiliated with a carrier has the effect of putting that carrier and persons affiliated with it, taken together, in control of another carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A transaction by at least 2 persons acting together (one of whom is a carrier or is affiliated with a carrier) has the effect of putting those persons and carriers and persons affiliated with any of them, or with any of those affiliated carriers, taken together, in control of another carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A person is affiliated with a carrier under this subchapter if, because of the relationship between that person and a carrier, it is reasonable to believe that the affairs of another carrier, control of which may be acquired by that person, will be managed in the interest of the other carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Approval and authorization by the Commission are not required if the only parties to a transaction referred to in subsection (a) of this section are motor carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title and the aggregate gross operating revenues of those carriers were not more than $2,000,000 during a period of 12 consecutive months ending not more than 6 months before the date of the agreement of the parties covering the transaction. However, the approval and authorization of the Commission is required when a motor carrier that is controlled by or affiliated with a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of that chapter is a party to the transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The approval and authorization of the Commission are not required if the only parties to a transaction referred to in subsection (a) of this section are street, suburban, or interurban electric railways that are not controlled by or under common control with a carrier that is operated as part of a general railroad system of transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Notwithstanding any provisions of this title, the Interstate Commerce Commission, in a matter related to a motor carrier of property providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title, may exempt a person, class of persons, transaction, or class of transactions from the merger, consolidation, and acquisition of control provisions of this subchapter if the Commission finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the application of such provisions is not necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) either (i) the transaction is of limited scope, or (ii) the application of such provisions is not needed to protect shippers from the abuse of market power.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) At least 60 days before any transaction exempt under this subsection from the merger, consolidation, and acquisition of control provisions of this subchapter may take effect, each carrier intending to participate in such transaction shall file with the Commission a notice of its intention to participate in such transaction and shall give public notice of such intention. The Commission shall prescribe the information to be contained in such notices, including the nature and scope of the transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission, on its own initiative or on complaint, may revoke an exemption granted under this subsection, to the extent it specifies, when it finds that application of the provisions of this section to the person, class of persons, or transportation is necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Commission, on its own initiative, finds that employees of any carrier intending to participate in a transaction exempt under this subsection from the merger, consolidation, and acquisition of control provisions of this subchapter are or will be adversely affected by such transaction or if employees of such carrier adversely affected by such transaction file a complaint concerning such transaction with the Commission, the Commission shall revoke such exemption to the extent the Commission deems necessary to review and address the adverse effects on such employees.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission may begin a proceeding to approve and authorize a transaction referred to in section 11343 of this title on application of the person seeking that authority. When an application is filed with the Commission, the Commission shall notify the chief executive officer of each State in which property of the carriers involved in the proposed transaction is located and shall notify those carriers. If a motor carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title is involved in the transaction, the Commission must notify the persons specified in section 10328(b) of this title. The Commission shall hold a public hearing when a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of that chapter is involved in the transaction unless the Commission determines that a public hearing is not necessary in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In a proceeding under this section which involves the merger or control of at least two class I railroads, as defined by the Commission, the Commission shall consider at least the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effect of the proposed transaction on the adequacy of transportation to the public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the effect on the public interest of including, or failing to include, other rail carriers in the area involved in the proposed transaction.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:346 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the total fixed charges that result from the proposed transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the interest of carrier employees affected by the proposed transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) whether the proposed transaction would have an adverse effect on competition among rail carriers in the affected region.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In a proceeding under this section which involves only carriers of passengers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title, the Commission shall consider at least the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effect of the proposed transaction on the adequacy of transportation to the public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the effect on the public interest of including, or failing to include, other rail carriers in the area involved in the proposed transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the total fixed charges that result from the proposed transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the interest of carrier employees affected by the proposed transaction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission shall approve and authorize a transaction under this section when it finds the transaction is consistent with the public interest. The Commission may impose conditions governing the transaction. When the transaction contemplates a guaranty or assumption of payment of dividends or of fixed charges or will result in an increase of total fixed charges, the Commission may approve and authorize the transaction only if it finds that the guaranty, assumption, or increase is consistent with the public interest. When a rail carrier, or a person controlled by or affiliated with a rail carrier, is an applicant and the transaction involves a motor carrier, the Commission may approve and authorize the transaction only if it finds that the transaction is consistent with the public interest, will enable the rail carrier to use motor carrier transportation to public advantage in its operations, and will not unreasonably restrain competition. When a rail carrier is involved in the transaction, the Commission may require inclusion of other rail carriers located in the area involved in the transaction if they apply for inclusion and the Commission finds their inclusion to be consistent with the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In a proceeding under this section which does not involve the merger or control of at least two class I railroads, as defined by the Commission, the Commission shall approve such an application unless it finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) as a result of the transaction, there is likely to be substantial lessening of competition, creation of a monopoly, or restraint of trade in freight surface transportation in any region of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the anticompetitive effects of the transaction outweigh the public interest in meeting significant transportation needs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In making such findings, the Commission shall, with respect to any application that is part of a plan or proposal developed under section 333(a)&ndash;(d) of this title, accord substantial weight to any recommendations of the Secretary of Transportation. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to any proceeding under this section which involves only carriers of passengers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A rail carrier, or a person controlled by or affiliated with a rail carrier, together with one or more affected shippers, may apply for approval under this subsection of a transaction for the purpose of providing motor carrier transportation prior or subsequent to rail transportation to serve inadequately served shippers located on a railroad other than the applicant carrier. Such application shall be approved by the Commission if the applicants demonstrate presently impaired rail service and inadequate motor common carrier service which results in the serious failure of the rail carrier serving the shippers to meet the rail equipment or transportation schedules of shippers or seriously to fail otherwise to provide adequate normal rail services required by shippers and which shippers would reasonably expect the rail carrier to provide. The Commission shall approve or disapprove applications under this subsection within 30 days after receipt of such application. The Commission shall approve applications which are not protested by interested parties within 30 days following receipt of such application.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) A rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title or the Secretary of Transportation may apply, before January 1, 1982, for authority for and approval of a merger, consolidation, unification or coordination project (as described in section 333(c) of this title), joint use of tracks or other facilities, or acquisition or sale of assets involving one of those rail carriers, under this section instead of sections 11344 <!-- PDFPage:350 -->and 11345 of this title. The Secretary may apply under this section only when the parties to the application that are rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of that chapter consent to an application by the Secretary. A rail carrier may apply under this section only if it sent the proposed transaction to the Secretary for a report under section 11350 of this title at least 6 months before applying under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When the Commission notifies persons required to receive notice that an application has been filed under this section, the Commission must include in the notice a copy of the application, a summary of the proposed transaction, and the applicant's reasons and public interest justification for the transaction. When the Commission notifies the Secretary of Transportation that an application has been filed under this section, the Commission shall also request the report of the Secretary prepared under section 11350 of this title. By the 10th day after receiving an application under this section, the Commission shall send notice of the proposed transaction to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the Secretary of Transportation (unless the Secretary is the applicant under subsection (a) of this section).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission shall designate a panel of the Commission to make a recommended decision on each application under this section. The panel must begin a proceeding by the 90th day after the date the Commission receives the application, complete the proceeding by the 180th day after the application is referred to it, and give its recommended decision and certify the record to the entire Commission by the 90th day after the proceeding is completed. The panel may use employees appointed under section 3105 of title 5 and the Rail Services Planning Office in conducting the proceeding, evaluating the application and comments received about it, and determining whether it is in the public interest to approve and authorize the transaction under the last sentence of subsection (d) of this section. To carry out this subsection, the panel may make rules and rulings to avoid unnecessary costs and delay. In making its recommended decision, the panel shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) request the views of the Secretary of Labor about the effect of the transaction on rail carrier employees, particularly whether the proposal contains adequate employee protection provisions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretaries and the Attorney General shall send their written views to the panel. Those statements are available to the public under section 552(a) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When the recommended decision and record of a proceeding under this section are certified to the entire Commission, it must hear oral argument on the matter certified to it and make a final decision by the 120th day after receiving the recommended decision and record. The Commission may extend a time period under subsection (c) of this section or under this subsection but must make its final decision by the end of the 2d year after receipt of the application by the Commission. The Commission shall consider the report of the Secretary of Transportation under section 11350 of this title in making its final decision. The final decision must be accompanied by a written opinion stating the reasons for the Commission action. The Commission may&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">When a rail carrier is involved in a transaction for which approval is sought under sections 11344 and 11345 or section 11346 of this title, the Interstate Commerce Commission shall require the carrier to provide a fair arrangement at least as protective of the interests of employees who are affected by the transaction as the terms imposed under this section before February 5, 1976, and the terms established under sections 24307(c), 24312, and 24706(c) of this title. Notwithstanding this subtitle, the arrangement may be made by the rail carrier and the authorized representative of its employees. The arrangement and the order approving the transaction must require that the employees of the affected rail carrier will not be in a worse position related to their employment as a result of the transaction during the 4 years following the effective date of the final action of the Commission (or if an employee was employed for a lesser period of time by the carrier before the action became effective, for that lesser period).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission to act under this subchapter is exclusive. The Commission may approve and authorize a carrier, as defined in section 11301(a)(1) of this title, to change (1) a part of a class of its securities, as defined in section 11301(a)(2) of this title, or (2) a part of an instrument under which a class of its securities is issued or a class of its obligations is secured. When a change is approved and authorized by the Commission under this subchapter, the carrier may carry out the change notwithstanding an express provision in the affected instrument or a State law and without getting other approval from the Commission or from a State authority. A person participating in carrying out a change that is approved and authorized under this subchapter is exempt from all other law, including State and municipal law, as necessary to let that person carry out the change.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may not approve an application filed under this section by a carrier that is in equity receivership or reorganization under subchapter IV of chapter 11 of title 11.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A power granted to a carrier under this subchapter changes its powers under its corporate charter and under State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) This subchapter does not affect the negotiability of a security of a carrier or of the obligation of a carrier that assumed liability related to a security. This subchapter does not apply to an equipment-trust certificate under which a carrier is obligated, to an evidence of indebtedness of a carrier the payment of which is secured solely by equipment, or to another instrument under which that equipment-trust certificate or evidence of indebtedness was issued or by which either of them is secured.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;11362. Criteria for approval and authority</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A carrier may apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission for approval and authority to make a change under this subchapter. To approve a proposed change, the Commission must find that the proposed change&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is within the scope of section 11361 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will be in the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) will be in the best interests of the carrier, of each class of its stockholders, and of the holders of each class of the carrier's obligations that are affected by the change; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) will not be against the interests of a creditor of the carrier who is not affected by the change.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the change involves an issuance of securities, the Commission must also make the findings required under section 11301(d)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Commission shall begin a proceeding under this section on receipt of an application but may require an applicant to get assurances of assent to the change from the holders of the outstanding shares of the securities that will be affected by the change before continuing with the proceeding. The Commission may determine the percentage of the principal amount or number of those shares needed to establish assurance of assent to the change. A class of securities is considered to be affected by a proposed change only if the change is proposed to a part of that class or to a part of an instrument under which that class was issued or by which it is secured. However, if a proposed change is to an instrument under which at least 2 classes of securities were issued and are outstanding or secured by that instrument, only those classes to which the change is related are considered to be affected. The Commission shall divide the securities to be affected by a proposed change under this subchapter into reasonable classes for purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) On receipt of an application of a carrier under this section the Commission shall notify, and file a copy of the application with, the chief executive officer of each State in which that carrier operates. The appropriate authorities of those States are entitled to be admitted as parties to a proceeding under this section to represent the rights and interests of their people and States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The carrier must give notice of the proceeding to the holders of the class of securities affected. The Commission may direct the carrier to give notice to other persons the Commission determines to have an interest in the proceeding. The carrier may give notice under this subsection only after it gets assurances of assent when they are required under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Commission may impose conditions governing the proposed change. The Commission may determine the effective date for a change it approves and authorizes under this subchapter and may allow it to become effective on publication of a declaration to that effect by the carrier. After an application is approved, the Commission may change a condition imposed and impose supplemental requirements for good cause shown subject to the requirements of this subchapter.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) After making the findings required under section 11362(a) of this title, the Commission may approve and authorize the change if it is assented to by the holders of at least 75 percent of the aggregate principal amount or number of outstanding shares of each class of securities affected by the change. The Commission may increase the percentage required for assent under this subsection for a class of shares when an increase is in the public interest and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 75 percent of the shares in that class are held by less than 25 security holders; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that class is entitled to vote for the election of directors of the carrier and the Commission determines that the assent of at least 25 percent of the security holders of that class are controlled by the carrier or a person controlling the carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The carrier may withdraw its application after the Commission makes the findings required under section 11362(a) of this title. If the application is not withdrawn, the Commission must require the carrier to submit the proposed change, with conditions imposed by the Commission, to the holders of each class of its securities affected by the change for their assent or rejection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In determining the percentage of outstanding securities when making a finding under section 11362(a) of this title, a security that secures an evidence of indebtedness of the carrier or of a company controlling or controlled by the carrier is considered to be outstanding unless the Commission determines that the proposed change does not materially affect the interest of the holder of that evidence of indebtedness. When that security is considered to be outstanding, assent to a proposed change may be given, notwithstanding another instrument, only&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if the security is pledged as security under an instrument under which an evidence of indebtedness was issued and is outstanding, by the holder of a majority of the principal amount of the evidence of indebtedness; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the security secures an evidence of indebtedness not issued under an instrument under which an evidence of indebtedness was issued, by the holder of the evidence of indebtedness.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to a submission required under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission shall require the carrier to submit a proposed change to a security referred to in this subsection, with requirements imposed by the Commission, to the holder of the evidence of indebtedness referred to in paragraph (1)(A) and (B) of this subsection as appropriate, for assent or rejection. A carrier is not required to submit the change to the trustee of the instrument referred to in that paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If the Commission determines that the assent of the holder of a security not entitled to vote for the election of directors of the carrier or an evidence of indebtedness is in the control of the carrier or of a person controlling the carrier, that security or evidence of indebtedness is not considered to be outstanding.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission shall prescribe the rate, classification, rule, or practice for transportation or service provided by a household goods freight forwarder subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter IV of chapter 105 of this title when the Commission finds that a rate, classification, rule, or practice of a State causes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) between persons or localities in intrastate commerce and in interstate and foreign commerce, unreasonable discrimination against those persons or localities in interstate or foreign commerce; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) unreasonable discrimination against or imposes an unreasonable burden on interstate or foreign commerce.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) A State authority may only exercise jurisdiction over intrastate transportation provided by a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title if such State authority exercises such jurisdiction exclusively in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within 120 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, each State authority exercising jurisdiction over intrastate rates, classifications, rules, and practices for intrastate transportation described in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall submit to the Commission the standards and procedures (including timing requirements) used by such State authority in exercising such jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Within 90 days after receipt of the intrastate regulatory rate standards and procedures of a State authority under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Commission shall certify such State authority for purposes of this subsection if the Commission determines that such standards and procedures are in accordance with the standards and procedures applicable to regulation of rail carriers by the Commission under this subtitle. If the Commission determines that such standards and procedures are not in such accordance, it shall deny certification to such State authority, and such State authority may resubmit new standards and procedures to the Commission for review in accordance with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The standards and procedures existing in each State on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 for the exercise of jurisdiction over intrastate rail rates, classifications, rules, and practices shall be deemed to be certified by the Commission from that date until the date an initial determination is made by the Commission under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Any State authority which is certified by the Commission under this subsection may use its standards and procedures in exercising jurisdiction over intrastate rail rates, classifications, rules, and practices during the 5-year period commencing on the date of such certification. Any State authority which is denied certification or which does not seek certification may not exercise any jurisdiction over intrastate rates, classifications, rules, and practices until it receives certification under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any intrastate transportation provided by a rail carrier in a State which may not exercise jurisdiction over an intrastate rate, classification, rule, or practice of that carrier due to a denial of certification under this subsection shall be deemed to be transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Certification of a State authority under this subsection is valid for the 5-year period beginning on the date of such certification. Prior to the expiration of such 5-year period, the State authority shall resubmit its intrastate regulatory standards procedures to the Commission for subsequent certification in accordance with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) During any 5-year certification period, a State may not change its certified standards and procedures without notifying and receiving express approval from the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, a State authority may not exercise any jurisdiction over general rate increases under section 10706 of this title, inflation-based rate increases under section 10712 of this title, or fuel adjustment surcharges approved by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Any rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may petition the Commission to review the decision of any State authority, in any administrative proceeding in which the lawfulness of an intrastate rate, classification, rule, or practice is determined, on the grounds that the standards and procedures applied by the State were not in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle. The Commission shall take final action on any such petition within 30 days after the date it is received. If the Commission determines that the standards and procedures were not in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle, its order shall determine and authorize the carrier to establish the appropriate rate, classification, rule, or practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Commission has exclusive authority to prescribe an intrastate rate for transportation provided by a rail carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a rail carrier files with an appropriate State authority a change in an intrastate rate, or a change in a classification, rule, or practice that has the effect of changing an intrastate rate, that adjusts the rate to the rate charged on similar traffic moving in interstate or foreign commerce; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the State authority does not act finally on the change by the 120th day after it was filed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When a rail carrier files an application with the Commission under this subsection, the <!-- PDFPage:360 -->Commission shall prescribe the intrastate rate under the standards of subsection (a) of this section and chapter 107 of this title. Notice of the application shall be served on the State authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) No State or political subdivision thereof and no interstate agency or other political agency of two or more States shall enact or enforce any law, rule, regulation, standard, or other provision having the force and effect of law relating to scheduling of interstate or intrastate transportation provided by motor common carrier of passengers subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title on an authorized interstate route or relating to the implementation of any reduction in the rates for such transportation except to the extent that notice, not in excess of 30 days, of changes in schedules may be required. This subsection shall not apply to intrastate commuter bus operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Commission may take action (1) under this section only after a full hearing, or (2) with respect to a rate, rule, or practice of a motor common carrier of passengers, in accordance with the procedures established by the Commission under subsection (e)(3)(B)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#11501_1_target" name="11501_1">1</a></sup> of this section.

When a State registration requirement imposes obligations in excess of the standards, the part in excess is an unreasonable burden.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, the Commission shall prescribe amendments to the standards existing as of such date of enactment.

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to file and maintain evidence of such certificate or permit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to file satisfactory proof of required insurance or qualification as a self-insurer;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) shall establish a fee system for the filing of proof of insurance as provided under subparagraph (A)(ii) of this paragraph that (I) will be based on the number of commercial motor vehicles the carrier operates in a State and on the number of States in which the carrier operates, (II) will minimize the costs of complying with the registration system, and (III) will result in a fee for each participating State that is equal to the fee, not to exceed $10 per vehicle, that such State collected or charged as of November 15, 1991; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) shall not authorize the charging or collection of any fee for filing and maintaining a certificate or permit under subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Prohibited fees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The charging or collection of any fee under this section that is not in accordance with the fee system established under subparagraph (B)(iv) of this paragraph shall be deemed to be a burden on interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on participation by states</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Only a State which, as of January 1, 1991, charged or collected a fee for a vehicle identification stamp or number under part 1023 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, shall be eligible to participate as a registration State under this subsection or to receive any fee revenue under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Effective date of amendments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amendments prescribed under this subsection shall take effect by January 1, 1994.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission may begin an investigation under this subtitle on its own initiative or on complaint. If the Commission finds that a carrier, broker or freight forwarder is violating this subtitle, the Commission shall take appropriate action to compel compliance with this subtitle. If the Commission finds that a foreign motor carrier or foreign motor private carrier is violating section 10530 of this title, the Commission shall take appropriate action to compel compliance with such section. The Commission may take that action only after giving the carrier, broker or freight forwarder notice of the investigation and an opportunity for a proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A person, including a governmental authority, may file with the Commission a complaint about a violation of this subtitle by a carrier providing, or broker for, transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this subtitle or a foreign motor carrier or foreign motor private carrier providing transportation under a certificate of registration issued under section 10530 of this title, or freight forwarder. The complaint must state the facts that are the subject of the violation and, if it is against a water carrier, must be made under oath. The Commission may dismiss a complaint it determines does not state reasonable grounds for investigation and action. However, the Commission may not dismiss a complaint made against a common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title because of the absence of direct damage to the complainant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A formal investigative proceeding begun by the Commission under subsection (a) of this section is dismissed automatically unless it is concluded by the Commission with administrative finality by the end of the 3d year after the date on which it was begun.</p>

<p class="note-body">The section consolidates and restates the source provisions for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is patterned after 49:1003(f) (1st sentence) and 1006(a) (last sentence) for clarity. The words &ldquo;an investigation under this subtitle&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;investigate .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whether any freight forwarder has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter or <!-- PDFPage:370 -->with any order, rule, regulation, or requirement issued or established pursuant thereto&rdquo; as being more inclusive and appropriate in view of the power to &ldquo;compel compliance&rdquo; in 49:1003(f) and restated in this subsection. The words &ldquo;after giving the carrier .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. notice of the investigation and an opportunity for a proceeding&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;after notice and hearing&rdquo; in 49:1003(f) and &ldquo;If such freight forwarder shall not satisfy the complaint within a time specified by the Commission&rdquo; in 49:1006(a) for clarity and to conform to other sections of the revised title. The words &ldquo;it shall be the duty of the Commission to investigate the matters complained of in such manner and by such means as it shall deem proper&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary in view of section 10321(a) of the revised title requiring the Commission to carry out the revised subtitle. The words &ldquo;or there shall be any reasonable ground for investigating said complaint&rdquo; are omitted as surplus in view of subsection (b). The text of 49:5(8) (less last sentence), (10) and 1011(d), (f) are omitted as unnecessary in view of the restatement of the general investigatory and enforcement power of the Commission. The 2d sentence of 49:13(1) is omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;person, firm, corporation, company, or association, or any mercantile, agricultural, or manufacturing society or other organization .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or any common carrier&rdquo; in view of the definition of &ldquo;person&rdquo; in section 10102 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;governmental authority&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;State board&rdquo; and &ldquo;or any body politic or municipal organization&rdquo; for consistency and as being more inclusive. The words &ldquo;file .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a complaint&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;may make complaint in writing&rdquo; for consistency. The words &ldquo;about a violation of this subtitle&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;of anything done or omitted to be done .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in contravention of the provisions thereof&rdquo; in 49:13(1) for clarity. The words &ldquo;in violation of this section or of section 317 of this title&rdquo; in 49:316(e) are omitted as surplus in view of the restatement of 49:304(c). The words &ldquo;must state the facts&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall briefly state the facts&rdquo; in 49:13(1) and for &ldquo;state fully the facts&rdquo; in 49:1006(a) for consistency and in view of the power of the Commission to prescribe regulations to carry out the revised subtitle in section 10321(a) of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;which is instituted by the Commission after February 5, 1976&rdquo; are omitted as executed.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;11705. Rights and remedies of persons injured by certain carriers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A person injured because a carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under chapter 105 of this title or a freight forwarder does not obey an order of the Commission, except an order for the payment of money, may bring a civil action to enforce that order under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of <!-- PDFPage:373 -->the Commission under chapter 105 of this title or a freight forwarder is liable to a person for amounts charged that exceed the applicable rate for transportation or service contained in a tariff filed under subchapter IV of chapter 107 of this title or the applicable freight forwarder rate, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I or III of chapter 105 of this title is liable for damages sustained by a person as a result of an act or omission of that carrier in violation of this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II or IV of chapter 105 of this title or a freight forwarder is liable for damages resulting from the imposition of rates for transportation or service the Commission finds to be in violation of this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A person may file a complaint with the Commission under section 11701(b) of this title or bring a civil action under subsection (b) (1) or (2) of this section to enforce liability against a common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I or III of chapter 105 of this title. A person may begin a proceeding under section 10704 or 10705 of this title to enforce liability under subsection (b)(3) of this section by filing a complaint with the Commission under section 11701(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Commission makes an award under subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall order the carrier to pay the amount awarded by a specific date. The Commission may order a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I or III of chapter 105 of this title to pay damages only when the proceeding is on complaint. The person for whose benefit an order of the Commission requiring the payment of money is made may bring a civil action to enforce that order under this paragraph if the carrier does not pay the amount awarded by the date payment was ordered to be made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) When a person begins a civil action under subsection (b) of this section to enforce an order of the Commission requiring the payment of damages by a common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I or III of chapter 105 of this title, the text of the order of the Commission must be included in the complaint. In addition to the district courts of the United States, a State court of general jurisdiction having jurisdiction of the parties has jurisdiction to enforce an order under this paragraph. The findings and order of the Commission are competent evidence of the facts stated in them. Trial in a civil action brought in a district court of the United States under this paragraph is in the judicial district (A) in which the plaintiff resides, (B) in which the principal operating office of the carrier is located, (C) if a rail carrier, through which the railroad line of that carrier runs, or (D) if a water carrier, in which a port of call on a route operated by that carrier is located. In a civil action under this paragraph, the plaintiff is liable for only those costs that accrue on an appeal taken by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) All parties in whose favor the award was made may be joined as plaintiffs in a civil action brought in a district court of the United States under this subsection and all the carriers that are parties to the order awarding damages may be joined as defendants. Trial in the action is in the judicial district in which any one of the plaintiffs could bring the action against any one of the defendants. Process may be served on a defendant at its principal operating office when that defendant is not in the district in which the action is brought. A judgment ordering recovery may be made in favor of any of those plaintiffs against the defendant found to be liable to that plaintiff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The district court shall award a reasonable attorney's fee as a part of the damages for which a carrier is found liable under this subsection. The district court shall tax and collect that fee as a part of the costs of the action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) must begin such a civil action within 2 years after the claim accrues if the transportation or service is provided by the carrier in the 1-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of the Negotiated Rates Act of 1993; and</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;11707. Liability of common carriers under receipts and bills of lading</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I, II, or IV of chapter 105 of this title and a freight forwarder shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it receives for transportation under this subtitle. That carrier or freight forwarder and any other common carrier that delivers the property and is providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I, II, or IV are liable to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading. The liability imposed under this paragraph is for the actual loss or injury to the property caused by (1) the receiving carrier, (2) the delivering carrier, or (3) another carrier over whose line or route the property is transported in the United States or <!-- PDFPage:377 -->from a place in the United States to a place in an adjacent foreign country when transported under a through bill of lading and, except in the case of a freight forwarder, applies to property reconsigned or diverted under a tariff filed under subchapter IV of chapter 107 of this title. Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not affect the liability of a carrier or freight forwarder. A delivering carrier is deemed to be the carrier performing the line-haul transportation nearest the destination but does not include a carrier providing only a switching service at the destination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A freight forwarder is both the receiving and delivering carrier. When a freight forwarder provides service and uses a motor common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title to receive property from a consignor, the motor common carrier may execute the bill of lading or shipping receipt for the freight forwarder with its consent. With the consent of the freight forwarder, a motor common carrier may deliver property for a freight forwarder on the freight forwarder's bill of lading, freight bill, or shipping receipt to the consignee named in it, and receipt for the property may be made on the freight forwarder's delivery receipt.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The carrier issuing the receipt or bill of lading under subsection (a) of this section or delivering the property for which the receipt or bill of lading was issued is entitled to recover from the carrier over whose line or route the loss or injury occurred the amount required to be paid to the owners of the property, as evidenced by a receipt, judgment, or transcript, and the amount of its expenses reasonably incurred in defending a civil action brought by that person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A common carrier and freight forwarder may not limit or be exempt from liability imposed under subsection (a) of this section except as provided in this subsection. A limitation of liability or of the amount of recovery or representation or agreement in a receipt, bill of lading, contract, rule, or tariff filed with the Commission in violation of this section is void.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If loss or injury to property occurs while it is in the custody of a water carrier, the liability of that carrier is determined by its bill of lading and the law applicable to water transportation. The liability of the initial or delivering carrier is the same as the liability of the water carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A common carrier of passengers may limit its liability under its passenger rate for loss or injury of baggage carried on passenger trains, boats, or motor vehicles, or on trains, or boats, or motor vehicles carrying passengers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A common carrier may limit its liability for loss or injury of property transported under section 10730 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) A civil action under this section may be brought against a delivering carrier (other than a rail carrier) in a district court of the United States or in a State court. Trial, if the action is brought in a district court of the United States is in a judicial district, and if in a State court, is in a State, through which the defendant carrier operates a railroad or route.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A civil action under this section may only be brought&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) against the originating rail carrier, in the judicial district in which the point of origin is located;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) against the delivering rail carrier, in the judicial district in which the principal place of business of the person bringing the action is located if the delivering carrier operates a railroad or a route through such judicial district, or in the judicial district in which the point of destination is located; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) against the carrier alleged to have caused the loss or damage, in the judicial district in which such loss or damage is alleged to have occurred.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A civil action under this section may be brought in a United States district court or in a State court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In this section, &ldquo;judicial district&rdquo; means (i) in the case of a United States district court, a judicial district of the United States, and (ii) in the case of a State court, the applicable geographic area over which such court exercises jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A carrier or freight forwarder may not provide by rule, contract, or otherwise, a period of less than 9 months for filing a claim against it under this section and a period of less than 2 years for bringing a civil action against it under this section. The period for bringing a civil action is computed from the date the carrier or freight forwarder gives a person written notice that the carrier or freight forwarder has disallowed any part of the claim specified in the notice. For the purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an offer of compromise shall not constitute a disallowance of any part of the claim unless the carrier or freight forwarder, in writing, informs the claimant that such part of the claim is disallowed and provides reasons for such disallowance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) communications received from a carrier's or freight forwarder's insurer shall not constitute a disallowance of any part of the claim unless the insurer, in writing, informs the claimant that such part of the claim is disallowed, provides reasons for such disallowance, and informs the claimant that the insurer is acting on behalf of the carrier or freight forwarder.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;11711. Dispute settlement program for household goods carriers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) One or more motor common carriers providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title who want to establish a program to settle disputes between such carriers and shippers of household goods concerning the transportation of household goods may submit an application for establishing such program to the Commission. Such application shall be in such form and contain such information as the Commission may, by regulation, require. The Commission shall review and approve, in accordance with the provisions of this section, each application submitted under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall approve, at least within 45 days of its filing, any application to establish a program for settling disputes concerning the transportation of household goods which meets the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission may investigate at any time the functioning of any program approved under this section and, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, may suspend or revoke its approval for failure to meet the requirements of this section and such regulations as the Commission may issue to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) No program for settling disputes concerning the transportation of household goods may be approved under this section unless the program is a fair and expeditious method for settling such disputes and complies with each of the following requirements and such regulations as the Commission may issue:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The program is designed to prevent a carrier from having any special advantage in any case in which the claimant resides or does business at a place distant from the carrier's principal or other place of business.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The program provides for adequate notice of the availability of such program, including a concise easy-to-read, accurate summary of the program and disclosure of the legal effects of election to utilize the program. Such notice must be given to persons for whom household goods are to be transported by the carrier before such goods are tendered to the carrier for transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Upon request of a shipper, the carrier must promptly provide such forms and other information as are necessary for initiating an action under the program to resolve a dispute.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Each person, authorized pursuant to the program to arbitrate or otherwise settle disputes, must be independent of the parties to the dispute and must be capable, as determined under such regulations as the Commission may issue, to resolve such disputes fairly and expeditiously. The program must ensure that each person chosen to settle the disputes is authorized and able to obtain from the shipper or carrier any material and relevant information to the extent necessary to carry out a fair and expeditious decisionmaking process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) No fee for instituting a proceeding under the program may be charged the shipper; except that, if the program is binding solely on the carrier, the shipper may be charged a fee of not more than $25 for instituting a proceeding under the program. In any case in which a shipper is charged a fee under this paragraph for instituting a proceeding under the program and such dispute is settled in favor of the ship<!-- PDFPage:381 -->per, the person settling the dispute must refund such fee to the shipper unless the person settling the dispute determines that such refund is inappropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The program must not require the shipper to agree to utilize the dispute settlement program prior to the time that a dispute arises.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The program may provide for an oral presentation of a dispute concerning transportation of household goods by a party to the dispute (or a party's representative), but such oral presentation may be made only if all parties to the dispute expressly agree to such presentation and the date, time, and location of such presentation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Any person settling a dispute concerning transportation of household goods under the program must, as expeditiously as possible but at least within 60 days of receipt of written notification of the dispute, render a decision based on the information gathered, except that, in any case in which a party to the dispute fails to provide in a timely manner any information concerning such dispute which the person settling the dispute may reasonably require to resolve the dispute, the dispute settler may extend such 60-day period for a reasonable period of time. A decision resolving a dispute may include any remedies appropriate under the circumstances, including repair, replacement, refund, reimbursement for expenses, and compensation for damages.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Materials and information obtained in the course of a decisionmaking process to settle a dispute under a dispute settlement program approved under this section may not be used to bring an action under section 11910 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In any court action to resolve a dispute between a shipper of household goods and a motor common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title concerning the transportation of household goods by such carrier, the shipper shall be awarded reasonable attorney's fees if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the shipper submits a claim to the carrier within 120 days after the date the shipment is delivered or the date the delivery is scheduled, whichever is later;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the shipper prevails in such court action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) no dispute settlement program approved under this section was available for use by the shipper to resolve the dispute; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a decision resolving the dispute was not rendered under a dispute settlement program approved under this section within the period provided under subsection (b)(8) of this section or an extension of such period under such subsection; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the court proceeding is to enforce a decision rendered under a dispute settlement program approved under this section and is instituted after the period for performance under such decision has elapsed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) In any court action to resolve a dispute between a shipper of household goods and a motor common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title concerning the transportation of household goods by such carrier, such carrier may be awarded reasonable attorney's fees by the court only if the shipper brought such action in bad faith&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) after resolution of such dispute under a dispute settlement program approved under this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) after institution of a proceeding by the shipper to resolve such dispute under a dispute settlement program approved under this section but before (A) the period provided under subsection (b)(8) for resolution of such dispute (including, if applicable, an extension of such period under such subsection) ends, and (B) a decision resolving such dispute is rendered under such program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The provisions of this section shall apply only in the case of collect-on-delivery transportation of those types of household goods described in section 10102(11)(A) of this title.</p>
