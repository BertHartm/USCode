See the revision notes for section 501 of the revised title for an explanation of the transfer under 49:1655(f)(2).

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation should ensure that motor carriers operate safely by imposing civil penalties at a level calculated to ensure prompt and sustained compliance with Federal motor carrier safety and commercial driver's license laws.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) should establish and assess minimum civil penalties for each violation of a law referred to in subsection (a); and</p>

L. 98&ndash;554 in deterring violations of commercial motor vehicle safety regulations issued under title II of Pub.

L. 98&ndash;554, and was to further investigate the need for, and make recommendations concerning, increased fine levels for civil and criminal penalties, and the need for additional categories of civil and criminal penalties to deter further, and prosecute effectively, violations of such commercial motor vehicle safety regulations, and further directed Secretary to submit to Congress a report on the findings of this study, together with legislative recommendations, not later than 2 years after Oct. 30, 1984.</p>
