<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) of the International Civil Aviation Organization that are substantially compatible with standards of the Secretary for new subsonic aircraft in regulations of the Secretary at parts 36 and 91 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, prescribed between January 2, 1977, and January 1, 1982.</p>

<p class="note-body">In this section, the word &ldquo;providing&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;engaging in&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;acting through the Administrator&rdquo; and &ldquo;acting through the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (14 CFR part 36)&rdquo; are omitted for consistency. Section 6(c)(1) of the Department of Transportation Act (Public Law 89&ndash;670, 80 Stat. 938) transferred all duties and powers of the Federal Aviation Agency and the Administrator to the Secretary of Transportation. However, the Secretary was to carry out certain provisions through the Administrator. In addition, various laws enacted since then have vested duties and powers in the Administrator. All provisions of law the Secretary is required to carry out through the Administrator are included in 49:106(g). Before clause (1), the words &ldquo;If, by January 1, 1980, the International Civil Aviation Organization (hereafter referred to as &lsquo;ICAO&rsquo;) does not reach an agreement&rdquo; and &ldquo;commence a rulemaking to&rdquo; and 49 App.:2122(a) (last sentence) are omitted as executed. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;as such regulations were&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In clause (2), the words &ldquo;on noise standards and an international schedule&rdquo; and &ldquo;(annex 16)&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;of the Secretary for new subsonic aircraft in regulations of the Secretary at parts 36 and 91 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, prescribed between January 2, 1977, and January 1, 1982&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;set forth in such regulations issued by the Secretary (14 CFR parts 36 and 91) during the 5-year period thereafter&rdquo; for clarity and consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;in effect&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 102&ndash;581, title III, &sect;304, Oct. 31, 1992, 106 Stat. 4896, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Establishment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall jointly conduct a research program to develop new technologies for quieter subsonic jet aircraft engines and airframes.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Goal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The goal of the research program established by subsection (a) is to develop by the year 2000 technologies for subsonic jet aircraft engines and airframes which would permit a subsonic jet aircraft to operate at reduced noise levels.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Participation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out the program established by subsection (a), the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall encourage the participation of representatives of the aviation industry and academia.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Report to Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall jointly submit to Congress, on an annual basis during the term of the program established by subsection (a), a report on the progress being made under the program toward meeting the goal described in subsection (b).&rdquo;</p>
