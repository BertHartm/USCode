<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall require each air carrier and foreign air carrier providing foreign air transportation to comply with noise standards&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary prescribed for new subsonic aircraft in regulations of the Secretary in effect on January 1, 1977; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) of the International Civil Aviation Organization that are substantially compatible with standards of the Secretary for new subsonic aircraft in regulations of the Secretary at parts 36 and 91 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, prescribed between January 2, 1977, and January 1, 1982.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Compliance at Phased Rate</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall require each air carrier and foreign air carrier providing foreign air transportation to comply with the noise standards at a phased rate similar to the rate for aircraft registered in the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Nondiscrimination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The requirement for air carriers providing foreign air transportation may not be more stringent than the requirement for foreign air carriers.</p>

<p class="note-body">In this section, the word &ldquo;providing&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;engaging in&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;acting through the Administrator&rdquo; and &ldquo;acting through the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (14 CFR part 36)&rdquo; are omitted for consistency. Section 6(c)(1) of the Department of Transportation Act (Public Law 89&ndash;670, 80 Stat. 938) transferred all duties and powers of the Federal Aviation Agency and the Administrator to the Secretary of Transportation. However, the Secretary was to carry out certain provisions through the Administrator. In addition, various laws enacted since then have vested duties and powers in the Administrator. All provisions of law the Secretary is required to carry out through the Administrator are included in 49:106(g). Before clause (1), the words &ldquo;If, by January 1, 1980, the International Civil Aviation Organization (hereafter referred to as &lsquo;ICAO&rsquo;) does not reach an agreement&rdquo; and &ldquo;commence a rulemaking to&rdquo; and 49 App.:2122(a) (last sentence) are omitted as executed. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;as such regulations were&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In clause (2), the words &ldquo;on noise standards and an international schedule&rdquo; and &ldquo;(annex 16)&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;of the Secretary for new subsonic aircraft in regulations of the Secretary at parts 36 and 91 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, prescribed between January 2, 1977, and January 1, 1982&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;set forth in such regulations issued by the Secretary (14 CFR parts 36 and 91) during the 5-year period thereafter&rdquo; for clarity and consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;in effect&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
