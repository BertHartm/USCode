<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Delivery on Court Order and Surety Bond</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a negotiable bill of lading is lost, stolen, or destroyed, a court of competent jurisdiction may order the common carrier to deliver the goods if the person claiming the goods gives a surety bond, in an amount approved by the court, to indemnify the carrier or a person injured by delivery against liability under the outstanding original bill. The court also may order payment of reasonable costs and attorney's fees to the carrier. A voluntary surety bond, without court order, is binding on the parties to the bond.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Liability to Holder</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Delivery of goods under a court order under subsection (a) of this section does not relieve a common carrier from liability to a person to whom the negotiable bill has been or is negotiated for value without notice of the court proceeding or of the delivery of the goods.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the word &ldquo;If&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;Where&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;upon satisfactory proof of such loss, theft, or destruction&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;if the person claiming the goods gives a surety bond&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;and upon the giving of a bond, with sufficient surety&rdquo; to clarify the condition precedent to court approval of delivery. The words &ldquo;in an amount&rdquo; are added for clarity. The word &ldquo;indemnify&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;protect&rdquo; because it is more accurate. The words &ldquo;against liability under the outstanding original bill&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;from any liability or loss incurred by reason of the original bill remaining outstanding&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;surety bond&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;indemnifying bond&rdquo; for consistency in this section.</p>
