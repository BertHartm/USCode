<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by operators of hazardous liquid pipeline facilities and gathering lines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) each hazardous liquid pipeline facility, whether otherwise subject to this chapter, that crosses waters where a substantial likelihood of commercial navigation exists or that is located in an area described in the criteria as a high-density population area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) each hazardous liquid pipeline facility and gathering line, whether otherwise subject to this chapter, located in an area that the Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, describes as unusually sensitive to environmental damage if there is a hazardous liquid pipeline accident; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide that the identification be carried out through the inventory required under section 60102(e) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Areas To Be Included as Unusually Sensitive</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When describing areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage if there is a hazardous liquid pipeline accident, the Secretary shall consider areas where a pipeline rupture would likely cause permanent or long-term environmental damage, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) locations near pipeline rights-of-way that are critical to drinking water, including intake locations for community water systems and critical sole source aquifer protection areas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) locations near pipeline rights-of-way that have been identified as critical wetlands, riverine or estuarine systems, national parks, wilderness areas, wildlife preservation areas or refuges, wild and scenic rivers, or critical habitat areas for threatened and endangered species.</p>
