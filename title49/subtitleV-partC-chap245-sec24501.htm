<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Application of Safety and Employee Relations Laws and Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Chapter 105 of this title does not apply to Amtrak Commuter. However, laws and regulations governing safety, employee representation for collective bargaining purposes, the handling of disputes between carriers and employees, employee retirement, annuity, and unemployment systems, and other dealings with employees that apply to a rail carrier providing transportation subject to part A of subtitle IV apply to Amtrak Commuter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Application of Certain Additional Laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This part and, to the extent consistent with this part, the District of Columbia Business Corporation Act (D.C. Code &sect;29&ndash;301 et seq.) apply to Amtrak Commuter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Nonapplication of Rate, Route, and Service Laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State or other law related to rates, routes, or service in connection with rail passenger transportation does not apply to Amtrak Commuter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amtrak Commuter is not required to pay an additional tax because of an expenditure to acquire or improve real property, equipment, a facility, or right-of-way material or structures used to provide rail passenger transportation, even if that use is indirect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Tax Exemption for Certain Commuter Authorities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A commuter authority with which Amtrak Commuter could have made a contract to provide commuter rail passenger transportation under this chapter but which decided to provide its own rail passenger transportation beginning on January 1, 1983, is exempt, effective October 1, 1981, from paying a tax or fee to the same extent Amtrak is exempt.</p>

However, Amtrak and the Consolidated Rail Corporation retain appropriate trackage rights over rail property owned or leased by the authority. Compensation for the rights shall be reasonable.</p>
