<p class="note-body">In this section, the words &ldquo;may not&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;it shall be a violation&rdquo; and &ldquo;It shall be unlawful&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;After the date on which the Secretary of Transportation issues final regulations to enforce this section&rdquo; are omitted because of section 5907(b) of the revised title. The words &ldquo;to fail to comply with paragraph (1) or (2)&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because the failure to comply with an affirmative duty is a violation without the need to say so specifically. The word &ldquo;false&rdquo; is omitted as included in &ldquo;erroneous&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;written&rdquo; is omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;(as such term is defined in section 10102 of this title)&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of section 5901(1) of the revised title. The word &ldquo;transport&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;provide transportation of&rdquo; for consistency and to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
