<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) obstructions to the view of a pedestrian or a vehicle operator for a reasonable distance in either direction of a train's approach; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) other safety information involving such grade crossings;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) upon receiving a report pursuant to paragraph (1)(C) or (D), timely investigate the report, remove the obstruction if possible, or correct the unsafe circumstance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) ensure the placement at each grade crossing on rights-of-way that it owns of appropriately located signs, on which shall appear, at a minimum&mdash;</p>
