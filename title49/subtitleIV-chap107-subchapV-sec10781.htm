<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission shall investigate, establish, and report the value of all property owned or used by each carrier providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, except a street, suburban, or interurban electric rail carrier not operated as a part of a general railroad system of transportation. However, the Commission may investigate, establish, and report the value of property owned or used by such an electric rail carrier when the Commission decides that action is desirable in the public interest. When the Commission makes an investigation required to be made under this section, it must&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) inventory and list the property of that carrier in detail;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) indicate the value established under section 10782 of this title for that property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) classify the physical property under classifications that conform, as nearly as practicable, to the classification of expenditures prescribed by the Commission for railroads and equipment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Commission may prescribe&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the procedure to be followed when conducting an investigation under this subchapter;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:279 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the form in which to submit the results of the valuation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the classification of the elements that make up the established value.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The report for each investigation conducted under this subchapter shall indicate the value of the property of each common carrier as a whole and separately identify the value of its property in each State and territory and possession of the United States in which the property is located.</p>
