<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Operational authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If basic essential air service under subchapter II of this chapter is to be provided from an eligible point to a high density airport (other than Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport), the Secretary of Transportation shall ensure that the air carrier providing or selected to provide such service has sufficient operational authority at the high density airport to provide such service. The operational authority shall allow flights at reasonable times taking into account the needs of passengers with connecting flights.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If necessary to carry out the objectives of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall by order grant exemptions from the requirements of subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at high density airports), to air carriers using Stage 3 aircraft or to commuter air carriers, unless such an exemption would significantly increase operational delays.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Assurance of access</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary finds that an exemption under paragraph (2) would significantly increase operational delays, the Secretary shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that an air carrier providing or selected to provide basic essential air service is able to obtain access to a high density airport.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Action by the secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall issue a final order under this subsection on or before the 60th day after receiving a request from an air carrier for operational authority under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary finds it to be in the public interest at a high density airport (other than Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport), the Secretary may grant by order exemptions from the requirements of subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at high density airports), to enable air carriers and foreign air carriers to provide foreign air transportation using Stage 3 aircraft.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Slot withdrawals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not withdraw a slot at Chicago O'Hare International Airport from an air carrier in order to allocate that slot to a carrier to provide foreign air transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Equivalent rights of access</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall not take a slot at a high density airport from an air carrier and award such slot to a foreign air carrier if the Secretary determines that air carriers are not provided equivalent rights of access to airports in the country of which such foreign air carrier is a citizen.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Conversions of slots</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Effective May 1, 2000, slots at Chicago O'Hare International Airport allocated to an air carrier as of November 1, 1999, to provide foreign air transportation shall be made available to such carrier to provide interstate or intrastate air transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Slots for New Entrants</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary finds it to be in the public interest, the Secretary may by order grant exemptions from the requirements under subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at high density airports), to enable new entrant air carriers to provide air transportation at high density airports (other than Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) the impact of the prohibition on slot withdrawals in subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section on the aviation relationship between the United States Government and foreign governments, including whether the prohibition in such subsections will require the withdrawal of slots from general and military aviation in order to meet the needs of air carriers and foreign air carriers providing foreign air transportation (and the impact of such withdrawal on general aviation and military aviation) and whether slots will become available to meet the needs of air carriers and foreign air carriers to provide foreign air transportation as a result of the planned relocation of Air Force Reserve units and the Air National Guard at O'Hare International Airport.</p>
