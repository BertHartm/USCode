<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) requires an operator to identify a pipeline facility that may be affected by the proposed demolition, excavation, tunneling, or construction, to prevent damaging the facility; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary decides will protect a facility adequately against a hazard caused by demolition, excavation, tunneling, or construction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To the extent a public safety program referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection is <!-- PDFPage:850 -->not available, the Secretary shall prescribe standards requiring an operator to take action the Secretary prescribes to provide services comparable to services that would be available under a public safety program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may include in the standards prescribed under subsection (a) of this section a requirement that an operator of a hazardous liquid pipeline facility participate in a public safety program meeting the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection or maintain and carry out a damage prevention program that provides services comparable to services that would be available under a public safety program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Facility Operation Information Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall prescribe minimum standards requiring an operator of a pipeline facility subject to this chapter to maintain, to the extent practicable, information related to operating the facility and, when requested, to provide the information to the Secretary and an appropriate State official. The information shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the business name, address, and telephone number, including an operations emergency telephone number, of the operator;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) accurate maps and a supplementary geographic description, including an identification of areas described in regulations prescribed under section 60109 of this title, that show the location in the State of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) major gas pipeline facilities of the operator, including transmission lines and significant distribution lines; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) major hazardous liquid pipeline facilities of the operator;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a description of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the characteristics of the operator's pipelines in the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) products transported through the operator's pipelines in the State;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the manual that governs operating and maintaining pipeline facilities in the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) an emergency response plan describing the operator's procedures for responding to and containing releases, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) identifying specific action the operator will take on discovering a release;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) liaison procedures with State and local authorities for emergency response; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) communication and alert procedures for immediately notifying State and local officials at the time of a release; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) other information the Secretary considers useful to inform a State of the presence of pipeline facilities and operations in the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Pipe Inventory Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall prescribe minimum standards requiring an operator of a pipeline facility subject to this chapter and, to the extent the Secretary considers necessary, an operator of a gathering line that is not a regulated gathering line (as defined under section 60101(b)(2) of this title), to maintain for the Secretary, to the extent practicable, an inventory with appropriate information about the types of pipe used for the transmission of gas or hazardous liquid, as appropriate, in the operator's system and additional information, including the material's history and the leak history of the pipe. The inventory&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for a gas pipeline facility, shall include an identification of each facility passing through an area described in regulations prescribed under section 60109 of this title but shall exclude equipment used with the compression of gas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for a hazardous liquid pipeline facility, shall include an identification of each facility and gathering line passing through an area described in regulations prescribed under section 60109 of this title, whether the facility or gathering line otherwise is subject to this chapter, but shall exclude equipment associated only with the pipeline pumps or storage facilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Standards as Accommodating &ldquo;Smart Pigs&rdquo;</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall prescribe minimum safety standards requiring that the design and construction of a new gas pipeline transmission facility or hazardous liquid pipeline facility, and the required replacement of an existing gas pipeline transmission facility, hazardous liquid pipeline facility, or equipment, be carried out, to the extent practicable, in a way that accommodates the passage through the facility of an instrumented internal inspection device (commonly referred to as a &ldquo;smart pig&rdquo;). The Secretary may apply the standard to an existing gas or hazardous liquid transmission facility and require the facility to be changed to allow the facility to be inspected with an instrumented internal inspection device if the basic construction of the facility will accommodate the device.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than October 24, 1995, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations requiring the periodic inspection of each pipeline the operator of the pipeline identifies under section 60109 of this title. The regulations shall include any circumstances under which an inspection shall be conducted with an instrumented internal inspection device and, if the device is not required, use of an inspection method that is at least as effective as using the device in providing for the safety of the pipeline.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Effective Dates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A standard prescribed under this section and section 60110 of this title is effective on the 30th day after the Secretary prescribes the standard. However, the Secretary for good cause may prescribe a different effective date when required because of the time reasonably necessary to comply with the standard. The different date must be specified in the regulation prescribing the standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Safety Condition Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations requiring each operator of a pipeline facility (except a master meter) to submit to the Secretary a written report on any&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) condition that is a hazard to life, property, or the environment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) safety-related condition that causes or has caused a significant change or restriction in the operation of a pipeline facility.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary must receive the report not later than 5 working days after a representative of a person to which this section applies first establishes that the condition exists. Notice of the condition shall be given concurrently to appropriate State authorities.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:851 --><p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Carbon Dioxide Regulation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall regulate carbon dioxide transported by a hazardous liquid pipeline facility.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;60103. Standards for liquefied natural gas pipeline facilities</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Location Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe minimum safety standards for deciding on the location of a new liquefied natural gas pipeline facility. In prescribing a standard, the Secretary shall consider the&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) kind and use of the facility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) existing and projected population and demographic characteristics of the location;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) existing and proposed land use near the location;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) natural physical aspects of the location;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) medical, law enforcement, and fire prevention capabilities near the location that can cope with a risk caused by the facility; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) need to encourage remote siting.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Design, Installation, Construction, Inspection, and Testing Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe minimum safety standards for designing, installing, constructing, initially inspecting, and initially testing a new liquefied natural gas pipeline facility. When prescribing a standard, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the characteristics of material to be used in constructing the facility and of alternative material;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) design factors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the characteristics of the liquefied natural gas to be stored or converted at, or transported by, the facility; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the public safety factors of the design and of alternative designs, particularly the ability to prevent and contain a liquefied natural gas spill.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Nonapplication</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a design, location, installation, construction, initial inspection, or initial testing standard prescribed under this chapter after March 1, 1978, does not apply to an existing liquefied natural gas pipeline facility if the standard is to be applied because of authority given&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) under this chapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) under another law, and the standard is not prescribed at the time the authority is applied.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Any design, installation, construction, initial inspection, or initial testing standard prescribed under this chapter after March 1, 1978, may provide that the standard applies to any part of a replacement component of a liquefied natural gas pipeline facility if the component or part is placed in service after the standard is prescribed and application of the standard&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) does not make the component or part incompatible with other components or parts; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) is not impracticable otherwise.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any location standard prescribed under this chapter after March 1, 1978, does not apply to any part of a replacement component of an existing liquefied natural gas pipeline facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A design, installation, construction, initial inspection, or initial testing standard does not apply to a liquefied natural gas pipeline facility existing when the standard is adopted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Operation and Maintenance Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe minimum operating and maintenance standards for a liquefied natural gas pipeline facility. In prescribing a standard, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the conditions, features, and type of equipment and structures that make up or are used in connection with the facility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the fire prevention and containment equipment at the facility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) security measures to prevent an intentional act that could cause a liquefied natural gas accident;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:853 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) maintenance procedures and equipment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the training of personnel in matters specified by this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) other factors and conditions related to the safe handling of liquefied natural gas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Effective Dates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A standard prescribed under this section is effective on the 30th day after the Secretary of Transportation prescribes the standard. However, the Secretary for good cause may prescribe a different effective date when required because of the time reasonably necessary to comply with the standard. The different date must be specified in the regulation prescribing the standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Contingency Plans</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A new liquefied natural gas pipeline facility may be operated only after the operator submits an adequate contingency plan that states the action to be taken if a liquefied natural gas accident occurs. The Secretary of Energy or appropriate State or local authority shall decide if the plan is adequate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Effect on Other Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section does not preclude applying a standard prescribed under section 60102 of this title to a gas pipeline facility (except a liquefied natural gas pipeline facility) associated with a liquefied natural gas pipeline facility.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Requirements and Submission</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in this section and sections 60114 and 60121 of this title, the Secretary of Transportation may not prescribe or enforce safety standards and practices for an intrastate pipeline facility or intrastate pipeline transportation to the extent that the safety standards and practices are regulated by a State authority (including a municipality if the standards and practices apply to intrastate gas pipeline transportation) that submits to the Secretary annually a certification for the facilities and transportation that complies with subsections (b) and (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Contents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each certification submitted under subsection (a) of this section shall state that the State authority&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has regulatory jurisdiction over the standards and practices to which the certification applies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has adopted, by the date of certification, each applicable standard prescribed under this chapter or, if a standard under this chapter was prescribed not later than 120 days before certification, is taking steps to adopt that standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is enforcing each adopted standard through ways that include inspections conducted by State employees meeting the qualifications the Secretary prescribes under section 60107(d)(1)(C) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) is encouraging and promoting programs designed to prevent damage by demolition, excavation, tunneling, or construction activity to the pipeline facilities to which the certification applies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) may require record maintenance, reporting, and inspection substantially the same as provided under section 60117 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) may require that plans for inspection and maintenance under section 60108 (a) and (b) of this title be filed for approval; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) may enforce safety standards of the authority under a law of the State by injunctive relief and civil penalties substantially the same as provided under sections 60120 and 60122(a)(1) and (b)&ndash;(f) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Each certification submitted under subsection (a) of this section shall include a report that contains&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the name and address of each person to whom the certification applies that is subject to the safety jurisdiction of the State authority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) each accident or incident reported during the prior 12 months by that person involving a fatality, personal injury requiring hospitalization, or property damage or loss of more than an amount the Secretary establishes (even if the person sustaining the fatality, personal injury, or property damage or loss is not subject to the safety jurisdiction of the authority), any other accident the authority considers <!-- PDFPage:855 -->significant, and a summary of the investigation by the authority of the cause and circumstances surrounding the accident or incident;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the record maintenance, reporting, and inspection practices conducted by the authority to enforce compliance with safety standards prescribed under this chapter to which the certification applies, including the number of inspections of pipeline facilities the authority made during the prior 12 months; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) any other information the Secretary requires.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The report included in the first certification submitted under subsection (a) of this section is only required to state information available at the time of certification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Application</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A certification in effect under this section does not apply to safety standards prescribed under this chapter after the date of certification. This chapter applies to each applicable safety standard prescribed after the date of certification until the State authority adopts the standard and submits the appropriate certification to the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Monitoring</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may monitor a safety program established under this section to ensure that the program complies with the certification. A State authority shall cooperate with the Secretary under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Rejections of Certification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If after receiving a certification the Secretary decides the State authority is not enforcing satisfactorily compliance with applicable safety standards prescribed under this chapter, the Secretary may reject the certification, assert United States Government jurisdiction, or take other appropriate action to achieve adequate enforcement. The Secretary shall give the authority notice and an opportunity for a hearing before taking final action under this subsection. When notice is given, the burden of proof is on the authority to demonstrate that it is enforcing satisfactorily compliance with the prescribed standards.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Plans</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Each person transporting gas or hazardous liquid or owning or operating an intrastate gas pipeline facility or hazardous liquid pipeline facility shall carry out a current written plan (including any changes) for inspection and maintenance of each facility used in the transportation and owned or operated by the person. A copy of the plan shall be kept at any office of the person the Secretary of Transportation considers appropriate. The Secretary also may require a person transporting gas or hazardous liquid or owning or operating a pipeline facility subject to this chapter to file a plan for inspection and maintenance for approval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary or a State authority responsible for enforcing standards prescribed under this chapter decides that a plan required under paragraph (1) of this subsection is inadequate for safe operation, the Secretary or authority shall require the person to revise the plan. Revision may be required only after giving notice and an opportunity for a hearing. A plan required under paragraph (1) must be practicable and designed to meet the need for pipeline safety and must include terms designed to enhance the ability to discover safety-related conditions described in section 60102(h)(1) of this title. In deciding on the adequacy of a plan, the Secretary or authority shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) relevant available pipeline safety information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the appropriateness of the plan for the particular kind of pipeline transportation or facility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the reasonableness of the plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the extent to which the plan will contribute to public safety and the protection of the environment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A plan required under this subsection shall be made available to the Secretary or State authority on request under section 60117 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Inspection and Testing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall inspect and require appropriate testing of a pipeline facility subject to this chapter that is not covered by a certification under section 60105 of this title or an agreement under section 60106 of this title. The Secretary shall decide on the frequency and type of inspection and testing under this subsection on a case-by-case basis after considering the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the location of the pipeline facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the type, size, age, manufacturer, method of construction, and condition of the pipeline facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the nature and volume of material transported through the pipeline facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the pressure at which that material is transported.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) climatic, geologic, and seismic characteristics (including soil characteristics) and conditions of the area in which the pipeline facility is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) existing and projected population and demographic characteristics of the area in which the pipeline facility is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) for a hazardous liquid pipeline facility, the proximity of the area in which the facility is located to an area that is unusually sensitive to environmental damage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) the frequency of leaks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) other factors the Secretary decides are relevant to the safety of pipeline facilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:858 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) To the extent and in amounts provided in advance in an appropriation law, the Secretary shall decide on the frequency of inspection under paragraph (1) of this subsection. However, an inspection must occur at least once every 2 years. The Secretary may reduce the frequency of an inspection of a master meter system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Testing under this subsection shall use the most appropriate technology practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Pipeline Facilities Offshore and in Navigable Waters</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; means permanently removed from service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) &ldquo;pipeline facility&rdquo; includes an underwater abandoned pipeline facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) if a pipeline facility has no operator, the most recent operator of the facility is deemed to be the operator of the facility.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Not later than May 16, 1993, on the basis of experience with the inspections under section 3(h)(1)(A) of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 or section 203(<em>l</em>)(1)(A) of the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as appropriate, and any other information available to the Secretary, the Secretary shall establish a mandatory, systematic, and, where appropriate, periodic inspection program of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) all offshore pipeline facilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any other pipeline facility crossing under, over, or through navigable waters (as defined by the Secretary) if the Secretary decides that the location of the facility in those navigable waters could pose a hazard to navigation or public safety.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In prescribing regulations to carry out subparagraph (A) of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Secretary shall identify what is a hazard to navigation with respect to an underwater abandoned pipeline facility; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for an underwater pipeline facility abandoned after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall include requirements that will lessen the potential that the facility will pose a hazard to navigation and shall consider the relationship between water depth and navigational safety and factors relevant to the local marine environment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary shall establish by regulation a program requiring an operator of a pipeline facility described in paragraph (2) of this subsection to report a potential or existing navigational hazard involving that pipeline facility to the Secretary through the appropriate Coast Guard office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The operator of a pipeline facility described in paragraph (2) of this subsection that discovers any part of the pipeline facility that is a hazard to navigation shall mark the location of the hazardous part with a Coast-Guard-approved marine buoy or marker and immediately shall notify the Secretary as provided by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. A marine buoy or marker used under this subparagraph is deemed a pipeline sign or right-of-way marker under section 60123(c) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Secretary shall require by regulation that each pipeline facility described in paragraph (2) of this subsection that is a hazard to navigation is buried not later than 6 months after the date the condition of the facility is reported to the Secretary. The Secretary may extend that 6-month period for a reasonable period to ensure compliance with this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Not later than October 24, 1994, the Secretary shall establish standards on what is an exposed offshore pipeline facility and what is a hazard to navigation under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not later than 6 months after the Secretary establishes standards under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, or October 24, 1995, whichever occurs first, the operator of each offshore pipeline facility not described in section 3(h)(1)(A) of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 or section 203(<em>l</em>)(1)(A) of the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as appropriate, shall inspect the facility and report to the Secretary on any part of the facility that is exposed or is a hazard to navigation. This subparagraph applies only to a facility that is between the high water mark and the point at which the subsurface is under 15 feet of water, as measured from mean low water. An inspection that occurred after October 3, 1989, may be used for compliance with this subparagraph if the inspection conforms to the requirements of this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary may extend the time period specified in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph for not more than 6 months if the operator of a facility satisfies the Secretary that the operator has made a good faith effort, with reasonable diligence, but has been unable to comply by the end of that period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) The operator of a pipeline facility abandoned after October 24, 1992, shall report the abandonment to the Secretary in a way that specifies whether the facility has been abandoned properly according to applicable United States Government and State requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not later than October 24, 1995, the operator of a pipeline facility abandoned before October 24, 1992, shall report to the Secretary reasonably available information related to the facility, including information that a third party possesses. The information shall include the location, size, date, and method of abandonment, whether the facility has been abandoned properly under applicable law, and other relevant information the Secretary may require. Not later than April 24, 1994, the Secretary shall specify how the information shall be reported. The Secretary shall ensure that the Government maintains the information in a way accessible to appropriate Government agencies and State authorities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall request that a State authority having information on a collision between a vessel and an underwater pipeline facility report the information to the Secretary in a timely way and make a reasonable effort to specify the location, date, and severity of the <!-- PDFPage:859 -->collision. Chapter 35 of title 44 does not apply to this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary may not exempt from this chapter an offshore hazardous liquid pipeline facility only because the pipeline facility transfers hazardous liquid in an underwater pipeline between a vessel and an onshore facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Replacing Cast Iron Gas Pipelines</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall publish a notice on the availability of industry guidelines, developed by the Gas Piping Technology Committee, for replacing cast iron pipelines.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person may bring a civil action in an appropriate district court of the United States for an injunction against another person (including the United States Government and other governmental authorities to the extent permitted under the 11th amendment to the Constitution) for a violation of this chapter or a regulation prescribed or order issued under this chapter. However, the person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may bring the action only after 60 days after the person has given notice of the violation to the Secretary of Transportation or to the appropriate State authority (when the violation is alleged to have occurred in a State certified under section 60105 of this title) and to the person alleged to have committed the violation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may not bring the action if the Secretary or authority has begun and diligently is pursuing an administrative proceeding for the violation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) may not bring the action if the Attorney General of the United States, or the chief law enforcement officer of a State, has begun and diligently is pursuing a judicial proceeding for the violation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall prescribe the way in which notice is given under this subsection.</p>

The court may award costs to a prevailing defendant when the action is unreasonable, frivolous, or meritless. In this subsection, a reasonable attorney's fee is a fee&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) based on the actual time spent and the reasonable expenses of the attorney for legal services provided to a person under this section; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Additional Remedies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A remedy under this section is in addition to any other remedies provided by law. This section does not restrict a right to relief that a person or a class of persons may have under another law or at common law.</p>
