<p class="note-body">In this chapter, the word &ldquo;places&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;points&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;United States Postal Service&rdquo; and &ldquo;Postal Service&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Postmaster General&rdquo; in sections 401, 405, and 406 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85&ndash;726, 72 Stat. 754, 760) because of sections 4(a) and 6(o) of the Postal Reorganization Act (Public Law 91&ndash;375, 84 Stat. 773, 783).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;Except as provided in section 41906 of this title and section 5402 of title 39&rdquo; are added because section 41906 of the revised title and 39:5402 contain exceptions to the provisions restated in this subsection. The words &ldquo;transport mail by aircraft in foreign air transportation or between places in Alaska&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;transport mail&rdquo; because 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(A) provides that 49 App.:1375(b) no longer applies to interstate or overseas air transportation (except transportation of mail between 2 places in Alaska).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. Clauses (1) and (2) are substituted for &ldquo;to engage in air transportation&rdquo; because 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(A) provides that 49 App.:1375(b) no longer applies to interstate or overseas air transportation (except transportation of mail between 2 places in Alaska). In clause (4), the words &ldquo;between places described in clauses (1) and (2) of this subsection and every change in each schedule&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;between such points&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1), the words &ldquo;any schedule of an air carrier filed under subsection (b)(3) of this section&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;any such schedule&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(2), the words &ldquo;by order&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the word &ldquo;alter&rdquo; is omitted as being included in &ldquo;amend, or modify&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words &ldquo;adversely affected&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;aggrieved&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;appeal the order&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;apply .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for a review of such order&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words &ldquo;The Board may review, and&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;amend, modify&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;amend, revise&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (f) is substituted for 49 App.:1375(b) (8th sentence) to reflect the transfer of functions of the Civil Aeronautics Board to the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
