<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Sovereignty and Public Right of Transit</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The United States Government has exclusive sovereignty of airspace of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A citizen of the United States has a public right of transit through the navigable airspace. To further that right, the Secretary of Transportation shall consult with the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board established under section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 792) before prescribing a regulation or issuing an order or procedure that will have a significant impact on the accessibility of commercial airports or commercial air transportation for handicapped individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Use of Airspace</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall develop plans and policy for the use of the navigable airspace and assign by regulation or order the use of the airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace. The Administrator may modify or revoke <!-- PDFPage:587 -->an assignment when required in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator shall prescribe air traffic regulations on the flight of aircraft (including regulations on safe altitudes) for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) navigating, protecting, and identifying aircraft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) protecting individuals and property on the ground;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) using the navigable airspace efficiently; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) preventing collision between aircraft, between aircraft and land or water vehicles, and between aircraft and airborne objects.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) To establish security provisions that will encourage and allow maximum use of the navigable airspace by civil aircraft consistent with national security, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) establish areas in the airspace the Administrator decides are necessary in the interest of national defense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) by regulation or order, restrict or prohibit flight of civil aircraft that the Administrator cannot identify, locate, and control with available facilities in those areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding the military exception in section 553(a)(1) of title 5, subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5 applies to a regulation prescribed under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Foreign Aircraft</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A foreign aircraft, not part of the armed forces of a foreign country, may be navigated in the United States as provided in section 41703 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Aircraft of Armed Forces of Foreign Countries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Aircraft of the armed forces of a foreign country may be navigated in the United States only when authorized by the Secretary of State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>No Exclusive Rights at Certain Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person does not have an exclusive right to use an air navigation facility on which Government money has been expended. However, providing services at an airport by only one fixed-based operator is not an exclusive right if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is unreasonably costly, burdensome, or impractical for more than one fixed-based operator to provide the services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) allowing more than one fixed-based operator to provide the services requires a reduction in space leased under an agreement existing on September 3, 1982, between the operator and the airport.</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>Article 1</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">(1) This convention shall apply to all international transportation of persons, baggage, or goods performed by aircraft for hire. It shall apply equally to gratuitous transportation by aircraft performed by an air transportation enterprise.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) For the purpose of this convention the expression &ldquo;international transportation&rdquo; shall mean any transportation in which, according to the contract made by the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the transportation or a transshipment, are situated either within the territories of two High Contracting Parties, or within the territory of a single High Contracting Party, if there is an agreed stopping place within a territory subject to the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate or authority of another power, even though that power is not a party to this convention. Transportation without such an agreed stopping place between territories subject to the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate, or authority of the same High Contracting Party shall not be deemed to be international for the purposes of this convention.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Transportation to be performed by several successive air carriers shall be deemed, for the purposes of this convention, to be one undivided transportation, if it has been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it has been agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it shall not lose its international character merely because one contract or series of contracts is to be performed entirely within a territory subject to the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate, or authority of the same High Contracting Party.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>Article 2</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">(1) This convention shall apply to transportation performed by the state or by legal entities constituted under public law provided it falls within the conditions laid down in article 1.</p>

<p class="note-body">(1) In the transportation of passengers the liability of the carrier for each passenger shall be limited to the sum of 125,000 francs.

<h4 class="analysis-subhead"><em>Article 25</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">(1) The carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of this convention which exclude or limit his liability, if the damage is caused by his willful misconduct or by such default on his part as, in accordance with the law of the court to which the case is submitted, is considered to be equivalent to wilful misconduct.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:593 --><p class="note-body">(2) In the case of transportation of this nature, the passenger or his representative can take action only against the carrier who performed the transportation during which the accident or the delay occurred, save in the case where, by express agreement, the first carrier has assumed liability for the whole journey.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) As regards baggage or goods, the passenger or consignor shall have a right of action against the first carrier, and the passenger or consignee who is entitled to delivery shall have a right of action against the last carrier, and further, each may take action against the carrier who performed the transportation during which the destruction, loss, damage, or delay took place. These carriers shall be jointly and severally liable to the passenger or to the consignor or consignee.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Order of Civil Aeronautics Board Approving Increases in Liability Limitations of Warsaw Convention and Hague Protocol</h4>
<p class="note-body">Adopted by the Civil Aeronautics Board at its office in Washington, D.C., on the 13th day of May 1966.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Transportation by Air, gener<!-- PDFPage:594 -->ally known as the Warsaw Convention, creates a uniform body of law with respect to the rights and responsibilities of passengers, shippers, and air carriers in international air transportation. The United States became a party to the Convention in 1934, and eventually over 90 countries likewise became parties to the Convention.<sup><a href="#40105_1_target" name="40105_1">1</a></sup> On November 15, 1965, the U.S. Government gave notice of denunciation of the Convention, emphasizing that such action was solely because of the Convention's low limits of liability for personal injury or death to passengers. Pursuant to Article 39 of the Convention this notice would become effective upon 6 months&rsquo; notice, in this case, May 15, 1966. Subsequently, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) made efforts to effect an arrangement among air carriers, foreign air carriers, and other carriers (including carriers not members of IATA) providing the major portions of international air carriage to and from the United States to increase the limitations of liability now applicable to claims for personal injury and death under the Convention and the Protocol. The purpose of such action is to provide a basis upon which the United States could withdrawn its notice of denunciation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The arrangement proposed has been embodied in an agreement (Agreement CAB 18900) between various air carriers, foreign air carriers, and other carriers which has been filed with the Board pursuant to section 412(a) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and Part 261 of the Board's economic regulations and assigned the abovedesignated CAB number.</p>
<p class="note-body">By this agreement, the parties thereto bind themselves to include in their tariffs, effective May 16, 1966, a special contract in accordance with Article 22(1) of the Convention or the Protocol providing for a limit of liability for each passenger for death, wounding, or other bodily injury of $75,000 inclusive of legal fees, and, in case of a claim brought in a State where provision is made for separate award of legal fees and costs, a limit of $58,000 exclusive of legal fees and costs. These limitations shall be applicable to international transportation by the carrier as defined in the Convention or Protocol which includes a point in the United States as a point of origin, point of destination, or agreed stopping place. The parties further agree to provide in their tariffs that the Carrier shall not, with respect to any claim arising out of the death, wounding, or other bodily injury of a passenger, avail itself of any defense under Article 20(1) of the Convention or the Convention as amended by the Protocol. The tariff provisions would stipulate, however, that nothing therein shall be deemed to affect the rights and liabilities of the Carrier with regard to any claim brought by, on behalf of, or in respect of any person who has willfully caused damage which results in death, wounding, or other bodily injury of a passenger.</p>
<p class="note-body">The carriers by the agreement further stipulate that they will, at time of delivery of the tickets, furnish to each passenger governed by the Convention or the Protocol and by the special contract described above, a notice in 10 point type advising international passengers of the limitations of liability established by the Convention or the Protocol, or the higher liability agreed to by the special contracts pursuant to the Convention or Protocol as described above. The agreement is to become effective upon arrival by this Board, and any carrier may become a party to it by signing a counterpart thereof and depositing it with the Board. Withdrawal from the agreement may be effected by giving 12 months&rsquo; written notice to the Board and the other Carrier parties thereto.</p>
<p class="note-body">As indicated, the decision of the U.S. Government to serve notice to denounce the Convention was predicated upon the low liability limits therein for personal injury and death. The Government announced, however, that it would be prepared to withdraw the Notice of Denunciation if, prior to its effective date, there is a reasonable prospect for international agreement on limits of liability for international transportation in the area of $100,000 per passenger or on uniform rules without any limit of liability, and if pending such international agreement there is a provisional arrangement among the principal international air carriers providing for liability up to $75,000 per passenger.</p>
<p class="note-body">Steps, have been taken by the signing carriers to have tariffs become effective May 16, 1966, upon approval of this agreement, which will increase by special contract their liability for personal injury or death as described herein. The signatory carriers provide by far the greater portion of international transportation to, from, and within the United States. The agreement will result in a salutory increase in the protection given to passengers from the increased liability amounts and the waiver of defenses under Article 20(1) of the Convention or Protocol. The U.S. Government has concluded that such arrangements warrant withdrawal of the Notice of Denunciation of the Warsaw Convention. Implementation of the agreement will permit continued adherence to the Convention with the benefits to be derived therefrom, but without the imposition of the low liability limits therein contained upon most international travel involving travel to or from the United States. The stipulation that no tariff provision shall be deemed to affect the rights and liabilities of the carrier with regard to any claim brought by, on behalf of, or in respect of any person who has willfully caused damage which results in death, wounding or other bodily injury of a passenger operates to diminish any incentive for sabotage.</p>
<p class="note-body">Upon consideration of the agreement, and of matters relating thereto of which the Board takes notice, the Board does not find that the agreement is adverse to the public interest or in violation of the Act and it will be approved.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, and particularly sections 102, 204(a), and 412 thereof:</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>It is ordered</em>, That: 1. Agreement CAB 18900 is approved.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:598 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an air carrier not engaged directly in operating aircraft in air transportation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a foreign air carrier not engaged directly in operating aircraft in foreign air transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The exemption is effective to the extent and for periods that the Secretary decides are in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Safety Regulation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may grant an exemption from a regulation prescribed in carrying out sections 40103(b)(1) and (2), 40119, 44901, 44903, 44906, and 44935&ndash;44937 of this title when the Administrator decides the exemption is in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Other Economic Regulation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in this section, the Secretary may exempt to the extent the Secretary considers necessary a person or class of persons from a provision of chapter 411, chapter 413 (except sections 41307 and 41310(b)&ndash;(f)), chapter 415 (except sections 41502, 41505, and 41507&ndash;41509), chapter 417 (except sections 41703, 41704, 41710, 41713, and 41714), chapter 419, subchapter II of chapter 421, and sections 44909 and 46301(b) of this title, or a regulation or term prescribed under any of those provisions, when the Secretary decides that the exemption is consistent with the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Labor Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not exempt an air carrier from section 42112 of this title. However, the Secretary may exempt from section 42112(b)(1) and (2) an air carrier not providing scheduled air transportation, and the operations conducted during daylight hours by an air carrier providing scheduled air transportation, when the Secretary decides that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) because of the limited extent of, or unusual circumstances affecting, the operation of the air carrier, the enforcement of section 42112(b)(1) and (2) of this title is or would be an unreasonable burden on the air carrier that would obstruct its development and prevent it from beginning or continuing operations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the exemption would not affect adversely the public interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Flying Hours</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not exempt an air carrier under this section from a provision referred to in subsection (c) of this section, or a regulation or term prescribed under any of those provisions, that sets maximum flying hours for pilots or copilots.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Smaller Aircraft</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An air carrier is exempt from section 41101(a)(1) of this title, and the Secretary may exempt an air carrier from another provision of subpart II of this part, if the air carrier&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) provides passenger transportation only with aircraft having a maximum capacity of 55 passengers; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) provides the transportation of cargo only with aircraft having a maximum payload of less than 18,000 pounds; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) complies with liability insurance requirements and other regulations the Secretary prescribes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may increase the passenger or payload capacities when the public interest requires.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) An exemption under this subsection applies to an air carrier providing air transportation between 2 places in Alaska, or between Alaska and Canada, only if the carrier is authorized by Alaska to provide the transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may limit the number or location of places that may be served by an air carrier providing transportation only in Alaska under an exemption from section 41101(a)(1) of this title, or the frequency with which the transportation may be provided, only when the Secretary decides that providing the transportation substantially impairs the ability of an air carrier holding a certificate issued by the Secretary to provide its authorized transportation, including the minimum transportation requirement for Alaska specified under section 41732(b)(1)(B) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Emergency Air Transportation by Foreign Air Carriers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To the extent that the Secretary decides an exemption is in the public interest, the Secretary may exempt by order a foreign air carrier from the requirements and limitations of this part for not more than 30 days to allow the foreign air carrier to carry passengers or cargo in interstate air transportation in certain markets if the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) because of an emergency created by unusual circumstances not arising in the normal course of business, air carriers holding certificates under section 41102 of this title cannot accommodate traffic in those markets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) all possible efforts have been made to accommodate the traffic by using the resources of the air carriers, including the use of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) foreign aircraft, or sections of foreign aircraft, under lease or charter to the air carriers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the air carriers&rsquo; reservations systems to the extent practicable;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the exemption is necessary to avoid unreasonable hardship for the traffic in the markets that cannot be accommodated by the air carriers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) granting the exemption will not result in an unreasonable advantage to any party in a labor dispute where the inability to accommodate traffic in a market is a result of the dispute.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Secretary grants an exemption to a foreign air carrier under this subsection, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ensure that air transportation that the foreign air carrier provides under the exemption is made available on reasonable terms;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) monitor continuously the passenger load factor of air carriers in the market that hold certificates under section 41102 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) review the exemption at least every 30 days to ensure that the unusual circumstances that established the need for the exemption still exist.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may renew an exemption (including renewals) under this subsection for not more than 30 days. An exemption may continue for not more than 5 days after the unusual circumstances that established the need for the exemption cease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Notice and Opportunity for Hearing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may act under subsections (d) <!-- PDFPage:599 -->and (f)(3)(B) of this section only after giving the air carrier notice and an opportunity for a hearing.</p>

The words &ldquo;promulgated by the Board&rdquo;, &ldquo;by such air carrier to points within such State&rdquo;, and &ldquo;but not limited to&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The word &ldquo;Alaska&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;such State&rdquo; for clarity. The cross-reference is to section 41732(b)(1)(B) to correct an error in the source provisions. The cross-reference in 49 App.:1386(b)(6) to 49 App.:1389(c)(2) should have been to 49 App.:1389(f)(2). This error was not corrected when 49 App.:1389 was restated by section 202(b) of the Airport and Airway Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1987 (Public Law 100&ndash;223, 101 Stat. 1508).

<p class="note-body">In subsection (g)(1), before clause (A), the words &ldquo;required&rdquo;, &ldquo;a period&rdquo;, and &ldquo;to the extent necessary&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The word &ldquo;mail&rdquo; is omitted as being included in &ldquo;cargo&rdquo;. In clause (B), before subclause (i), the words &ldquo;for example&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (g)(3), the words &ldquo;a period&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (h), the words &ldquo;The Secretary may act under subsections (d) and (f)(3)(B) of this section&rdquo; are added because of the restatement. The word &ldquo;notice&rdquo; does not appear in 49 App.:1386(b)(6) (words between 5th and 6th commas) but is made applicable to both of the restated source provisions for consistency with subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code. The words &ldquo;opportunity for a&rdquo; are added for consistency in the revised title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding section 1341(a)(1)(B) of title 31, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may make a contract of not more than 5 years for the following types of services and items of supply related to those services for which amounts otherwise would be available for obligation only in the fiscal year for which appropriated:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) operation, maintenance, and support of facilities and installations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) operation, maintenance, and modification of aircraft, vehicles, and other highly complex equipment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) specialized training requiring high quality instructor skills, including training of pilots and aircrew members and foreign language training.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) base services, including ground maintenance, aircraft refueling, bus transportation, and refuse collection and disposal.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Required Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may make a contract under this section only if the Administrator finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there will be a continuing requirement for the service consistent with current plans for the proposed contract period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) providing the service will require a substantial initial investment in plant or equipment, or will incur a substantial contingent liability for assembling, training, or transporting a specialized workforce; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the contract will promote the best interests of the United States by encouraging effective competition and promoting economies in operation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When making a contract under this section, the Administrator shall be guided by the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The part of the cost of a plant or equipment amortized as a cost of contract performance may not be more than the ratio between the period of contract performance and the anticipated useful commercial life (instead of physical life) of the plant or equipment, considering the location and specialized nature of the plant or equipment, obsolescence, and other similar factors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Administrator shall consider the desirability of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) obtaining an option to renew the contract for a reasonable period of not more than 3 years, at a price that does not include charges for nonrecurring costs already amortized; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reserving in the Administrator the right, on payment of the unamortized part of the cost of the plant or equipment, to take title to the plant or equipment under appropriate circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Ending Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contract made under this section shall be ended if amounts are not made available to continue the contract into a subsequent fiscal year. The cost of ending the contract may be paid from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an appropriation originally available for carrying out the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an appropriation currently available for procuring the type of service concerned and not otherwise obligated; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Required Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may make a contract under this section if the Administrator finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the contract will promote the safety or efficiency of the national airspace system and will result in reduced total contract costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the minimum need for the property to be purchased is expected to remain substantially unchanged during the proposed contract period in terms of production rate, procurement rate, and total quantities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) there is a reasonable expectation that throughout the proposed contract period the Administrator will request appropriations for the contract at the level required to avoid cancellation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) there is a stable design for the property to be acquired and the technical risks associated with the property are not excessive; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the estimates of the contract costs and the anticipated savings from the contract are realistic.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall prescribe regulations for acquiring property <!-- PDFPage:605 -->under this section to promote the use of contracts under this section in a way that will allow the most efficient use of those contracts. The regulations may provide for a cancellation provision in the contract to the extent the provision is necessary and in the best interest of the United States. The provision may include consideration of recurring and nonrecurring costs of the contractor associated with producing the item to be delivered under the contract. The regulations shall provide that, to the extent practicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to broaden the aviation industrial base&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) this section and regulations prescribed under this section may not be carried out in a way that precludes or curtails the existing ability of the Administrator to provide for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) competition in producing items to be delivered under a contract under this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) ending a prime contract when performance is deficient with respect to cost, quality, or schedule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Contract Provisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A contract under this section may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be used for the advance procurement of components, parts, and material necessary to manufacture equipment to be used in the national airspace system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provide that performance under the contract after the first year is subject to amounts being appropriated; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) contain a negotiated priced option for varying the number of end items to be procured over the period of the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If feasible and practicable, an advance procurement contract may be made to achieve economic-lot purchases and more efficient production rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Cancellation Payment and Notice of Cancellation Ceiling</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If a contract under this section provides that performance is subject to an appropriation being made, it also may provide for a cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if the appropriation is not made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before awarding a contract under this section containing a cancellation ceiling of more than $100,000,000, the Administrator shall give written notice of the proposed contract and cancellation ceiling to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives. The contract may not be awarded until the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date of the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Ending Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contract made under this section shall be ended if amounts are not made available to continue the contract into a subsequent fiscal year. The cost of ending the contract may be paid from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an appropriation originally available for carrying out the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an appropriation currently available for procuring the type of property concerned and not otherwise obligated; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Number of operations authorized</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining the number of authorizations to issue to provide commercial air tour operations over a national park, the Administrator, in cooperation with the Director, shall take into consideration the provisions of the air tour management plan, the number of existing commercial air tour operators and current level of service and equipment provided by any such operators, and the financial viability of each commercial air tour operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Cooperation with nps</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before granting an application under this paragraph, the Administrator, in cooperation with the Director, shall develop an air tour management plan in accordance with subsection (b) and implement such plan.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Special rule for safety requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding subsection (c), an existing commercial air tour operator shall apply, not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this section, for operating authority under part 119, 121, or 135 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations. A new entrant commercial air tour operator shall apply for such authority before conducting commercial air tour operations over a national park or tribal lands.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;41104. Additional limitations and requirements of charter air carriers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Restrictions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe a regulation or issue an order restricting the marketability, flexibility, <!-- PDFPage:628 -->accessibility, or variety of charter air transportation provided under a certificate issued under section 41102 of this title only to the extent required by the public interest. A regulation prescribed or order issued under this subsection may not be more restrictive than a regulation related to charter air transportation that was in effect on October 1, 1978.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Scheduled Operations.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in paragraph (3), an air carrier, including an indirect air carrier, may not provide, in aircraft designed for more than 9 passenger seats, regularly scheduled charter air transportation for which the public is provided in advance a schedule containing the departure location, departure time, and arrival location of the flight unless such air transportation is to and from an airport that has an airport operating certificate issued under part 139 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (or any subsequent similar regulation).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this paragraph, the term &ldquo;regularly scheduled charter air transportation&rdquo; does not include operations for which the departure time, departure location, and arrival location are specifically negotiated with the customer or the customer's representative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subsection does not apply to any airport in the State of Alaska or to any airport outside the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Alaska</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier holding a certificate issued under section 41102 of this title may provide charter air transportation between places in Alaska only to the extent the Secretary decides the transportation is required by public convenience and necessity. The Secretary may make that decision when issuing, amending, or modifying the certificate. This subsection does not apply to a certificate issued under section 41102 to a citizen of the United States who, before July 1, 1977&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) maintained a principal place of business in Alaska; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) conducted air transport operations between places in Alaska with aircraft with a certificate for gross takeoff weight of more than 40,000 pounds.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Suspensions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall suspend for not more than 30 days any part of the certificate of a charter air carrier if the Secretary decides that the failure of the carrier to comply with the requirements described in sections 41110(e) and 41112 of this title, or a regulation or order of the Secretary under section 41110(e) or 41112, requires immediate suspension in the interest of the rights, welfare, or safety of the public. The Secretary may act under this paragraph without notice or a hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall begin immediately a hearing to decide if the certificate referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection should be amended, modified, suspended, or revoked. Until the hearing is completed, the Secretary may suspend the certificate for additional periods totaling not more than 60 days. If the Secretary decides that the carrier is complying with the requirements described in sections 41110(e) and 41112 of this title and regulations and orders under sections 41110(e) and 41112, the Secretary immediately may end the suspension period and proceeding begun under this subsection. However, the Secretary is not prevented from imposing a civil penalty on the carrier for violating the requirements described in section 41110(e) or 41112 or a regulation or order under section 41110(e) or 41112.</p>

The words &ldquo;in foreign air transportation or between places in Alaska&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;between any points within the United States or between the United States and foreign countries&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and because 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(A) provides that 49 App.:1371(m) no longer applies to interstate or overseas air transportation (except transportation of mail between 2 places in Alaska). In addition, Congress did not intend to maintain the regulation of domestic air transportation of mail. See section 40102(a) of the revised title defining &ldquo;air transportation&rdquo; to mean interstate or foreign air transportation or the transportation of mail by aircraft. The word &ldquo;currently&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;opportunity for a&rdquo; are added for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words &ldquo;or certificates&rdquo; are omitted as surplus because of 1:1. The word &ldquo;modify&rdquo; is added for consistency in the revised title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Liability Insurance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may issue a certificate to a citizen of the United States to provide air transportation as an air carrier under section 41102 of this title only if the citizen complies with regulations and orders of the Secretary governing the filing of an insurance policy or self-insurance plan approved by the Secretary. The policy or plan must be sufficient to pay, not more than the amount of the insurance, for bodily injury to, or death of, an individual or for loss of, or damage to, property of others, resulting from the operation or maintenance of the aircraft under the certificate. A certificate does not remain in effect unless the carrier complies with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Financial Responsibility</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To protect passengers and shippers using an aircraft operated by an air carrier issued a certificate under section 41102 of this title, the Secretary may require the carrier to file a performance bond or equivalent security in the amount and on terms the Secretary prescribes. The bond or security must be sufficient to ensure the carrier adequately will pay the passengers and shippers when the transportation the carrier agrees to provide is not provided. The Secretary shall prescribe the amounts to be paid under this subsection.</p>

All other matters, including those related to regulatory policy, shall be presented to the DOT in accordance with the procedures of the DOT.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Departments and agencies outside of the Executive Office of the President that identify matters of national defense or foreign relations while a decision is pending before the DOT shall, except as confidentiality is required for reasons of defense or foreign policy, make those matters known to the DOT in the course of its proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. (a) The DOT shall receive the recommendations, addressed to the President, of the departments and agencies referred to in section 3(c) of this Order.</p>

<p class="note-body">(b) If any department or agency that made recommendations to the President pursuant to Section 801 believes that, if the President decides not to disapprove a decision, the letter so advising the DOT should include a statement that the decision not to disapprove was based on national defense or foreign relations reasons, it should so indicate separately and explain why.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7.

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 10. None of the time deadlines specified in this Order shall be construed as a limitation on expedited presidential review of any decision under Section 801.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 11. The provisions of this Order shall become effective upon publication in the Federal Register and shall govern the review of any proposed decisions of the DOT that have not become final prior to that date under Executive Order No. 12547.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the agreement, request, modification, or cancellation is necessary to meet a serious transportation need or to achieve important public benefits (including international comity and foreign policy considerations); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the transportation need cannot be met or those benefits cannot be achieved by reasonably available alternatives that are materially less anticompetitive; or</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier or foreign air carrier may not subject a person, place, port, or type of traffic in foreign air transportation to unreasonable discrimination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Review and Negotiation of Discriminatory Foreign Charges</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation shall survey charges imposed on an air carrier by the government of a foreign country or another foreign entity for the use of airport property or airway property in foreign air transportation. If the Secretary of Transportation decides that a charge is discriminatory, the Secretary promptly shall report the decision to the Secretary of State. The Secretaries of State and Transportation promptly shall begin negotiations with the appropriate government to end the discrimination. If the discrimination is not ended in a reasonable time through negotiation, the Secretary of Transportation shall establish a compensating charge equal to the discriminatory charge. With the approval of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury shall impose the compensating charge on a foreign air carrier of that country as a condition to accepting the general declaration of the aircraft of the foreign air carrier when it lands or takes off.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of the Treasury shall maintain an account to credit money collected under paragraph (1) of this subsection. An air carrier shall be paid from the account an amount certified by the Secretary of Transportation to compensate the air carrier for the discriminatory charge paid to the government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Actions Against Discriminatory Activity</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may take actions the Secretary considers are in the public interest to eliminate an activity of a government of a foreign country or another foreign entity, including a foreign air carrier, when the Secretary, on the initiative of the Secretary or on complaint, decides that the activity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is an unjustifiable or unreasonable discriminatory, predatory, or anticompetitive practice against an air carrier; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) imposes an unjustifiable or unreasonable restriction on access of an air carrier to a foreign market.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation may deny, amend, modify, suspend, revoke, or transfer under paragraph (1) of this subsection a foreign air carrier permit or tariff under section 41302, 41303, 41304(a), 41504(c), 41507, or 41509 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Filing of, and Acting on, Complaints</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An air carrier, computer reservations system firm, or a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government may file a complaint under subsection (c) or (g) of this section with the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary shall approve, deny, or dismiss the complaint, set the complaint for a hearing or investigation, or begin another proceeding proposing remedial action not later than 60 days after receiving the complaint. The Secretary may extend the period for acting for additional periods totaling not more than 30 days if the Secretary decides that with additional time it is likely that a complaint can be resolved satisfactorily through negotiations with the government of the foreign country or foreign entity. The Secretary must act not later than 90 days after receiving the complaint. However, the Secretary may extend this 90-day period for not more than an additional 90 days if, on the last day of the initial 90-day period, the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) negotiations with the government have progressed to a point that a satisfactory resolution of the complaint appears imminent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an air carrier or computer reservations system firm has not been subjected to economic injury by the government or entity as a result of filing the complaint; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the public interest requires additional time before the Secretary acts on the complaint.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In carrying out paragraph (1) of this subsection and subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:644 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) solicit the views of the Secretaries of Commerce and State and the United States Trade Representative;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) give an affected air carrier or foreign air carrier reasonable notice and an opportunity to submit written evidence and arguments within the time limits of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) submit to the President under section 41307 or 41509(f) of this title actions proposed by the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretaries of State, the Treasury, and Transportation and the heads of other departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Government shall keep under review, to the extent of each of their jurisdictions, each form of discrimination or unfair competitive practice to which an air carrier is subject when providing foreign air transportation or a computer reservations system firm is subject when providing services with respect to airline service. Each Secretary and head shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) take appropriate action to eliminate any discrimination or unfair competitive practice found to exist; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) request Congress to enact legislation when the authority to eliminate the discrimination or unfair practice is inadequate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation shall report to Congress annually on each action taken under paragraph (1) of this subsection and on the continuing program to eliminate discrimination and unfair competitive practices. The Secretaries of State and the Treasury each shall give the Secretary of Transportation information necessary to prepare the report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 30 days after acting on a complaint under this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall report to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate on action taken under this section on the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Actions Against Discriminatory Activity by Foreign CRS Systems</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may take such actions as the Secretary considers are in the public interest to eliminate an activity of a foreign air carrier that owns or markets a computer reservations system, or of a computer reservations system firm whose principal offices are located outside the United States, when the Secretary, on the initiative of the Secretary or on complaint, decides that the activity, with respect to airline service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is an unjustifiable or unreasonable discriminatory, predatory, or anticompetitive practice against a computer reservations system firm whose principal offices are located inside the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) imposes an unjustifiable or unreasonable restriction on access of such a computer reservations system to a foreign market.</p>

The words &ldquo;foreign air transportation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;air transportation&rdquo; because 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(C) provides that 49 App.:1374 no longer applies to interstate or overseas air transportation except insofar as 49 App.:1374 requires air carriers to provide safe and adequate service.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Filing and Contents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the way prescribed by regulation by the Secretary of Transportation, every air carrier and foreign air carrier shall file with the Secretary, publish, and keep open to public inspection, tariffs showing the prices for the foreign air transportation provided between places served by the carrier and provided between places served by the carrier and places served by another air carrier or foreign air carrier with which through service and joint prices have been established. A tariff&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall contain&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to the extent the Secretary requires by regulation, a description of the classifications, rules, and practices related to the foreign air transportation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a statement of the prices in money that is not money of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) information that is required under the laws of a foreign country in or to which the air carrier or foreign air carrier is authorized to operate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Changes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, an air carrier or foreign air carrier may change a price or a classification, rule, or practice affecting that price or the value of the transportation provided under that price, specified in a tariff of the carrier for foreign air transportation only after 30 days after the carrier has filed, published, and posted notice of the proposed change in the same way as required for a tariff under subsection (a) of this section. However, the Secretary may prescribe an alternative notice requirement, of at least 25 days, to allow an air carrier or foreign air carrier to match a proposed change in a passenger fare or a charge of another air carrier or foreign air carrier. A notice under this paragraph must state plainly the change proposed and when the change will take effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the effect of a proposed change would be to begin a passenger fare that is outside of, or not covered by, the range of passenger fares specified under section 41509(e)(2) and (3) of this title, the proposed change may be put into effect only on the expiration of 60 days after the notice is filed under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Rejection of Changes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may reject a tariff or tariff change that is not consistent with this section and regulations prescribed by the Secretary. A tariff or change that is rejected is void.</p>

See section 40102(a) of the revised title defining &ldquo;air transportation&rdquo; to mean inter<!-- PDFPage:650 -->state or foreign air transportation or the transportation of mail by aircraft. The words &ldquo;passenger fare&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;fare&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title.</p>

The words &ldquo;proposed change in a passenger fare or a charge of another air carrier or foreign air carrier&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;fares or charges specified in another air carrier's or foreign air carrier's proposed tariff&rdquo; for clarity and consistency in this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;not covered by&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;to which such range of fares does not apply&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 1482(d)(4) of this Appendix .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. section 1482(d)(7) of this Appendix&rdquo; are omitted because those sections related to interstate and overseas air transportation and the source provisions restated in this section relate to foreign air transportation. In addition, the text of 49 App.:1551(a)(5)(D) provides that 49 App.:1482(d) ceased to be in effect on January 1, 1985, except as related to foreign air transportation. The reference in the source provisions to &ldquo;section 1482(j)(9) of this Appendix&rdquo; has been restated as though it were a reference to 49 App.:1482(j)(10) to correct an apparent error in the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979 (Public Law 96&ndash;192, 94 Stat. 35). Section 24(b) of S. 1300 of the 96th Congress (the derivative source for the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979), as originally passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, restated section 403(c)(2) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85&ndash;726, 72 Stat. 759) to read as it now does with a cross&ndash;reference to section 1002(j)(9) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. Also contained in those versions of S. 1300 in section 24(a) was an amendment to section 1002(j) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to add a paragraph (9) that contained language identical to what is now section 1002(j)(10) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. When S. 1300 was reported by the conference committee and enacted into law as the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979, section 24(a) had been changed so that a different paragraph (9) was added and what had been paragraph (9) was now designated as a new paragraph (10) to be added. Apparently, when the conference committee redesignated section 1002(j)(9) as 1002(j)(10) it did not make a corresponding change in the cross&ndash;reference in section 403(c)(2). See 125 Cong. Rec. 26936, 32147, 36939.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, &ldquo;commuter air carrier&rdquo; means an air carrier providing transportation under section 40109(f) of this title that provides at least 5 scheduled roundtrips a week between the same 2 places.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the text of 49 App.:1482a(2)(A) is omitted as unnecessary because the definition of &ldquo;air carrier&rdquo; in 49 App.:1301(3) is restated in section 40102(a) of the revised title and applies to this section and because the functions of the Civil Aeronautics Board under 49 App.:1482a were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation by 49 App.:1551(b)(1)(E) and the complete name of the Secretary is used the first time the term appears in a section. The text of 49 App.:1482a(3) is omitted as executed. The reference in the source provisions to &ldquo;section 416(b)(3) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 [49 App. U.S.C. 1386(b)(3)]&rdquo; has been restated as though it were a reference to section 416(b)(4) to correct an apparent error in the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95&ndash;504, 92 Stat. 1705). Section 24 of H.R. 12611 of the 95th Congress (the derivative source for 416(b)(4)), added section 416(b)(3) to the Federal Aviation Act. Section 29(c) added provisions that eventually were classified as 49 App.:1482a. Those provisions contained a reference to section 416(b)(3). When S. 2493 (passed in lieu of the House bill after being amended to contain much of the text of the House bill) was reported by the conference committee and enacted into law, section 32 added what had been a new 416(b)(3) as a new 416(b)(4). However, the conference committee did not make a corresponding change in the cross-reference in section 37(c), that added 49 App.:1482a. See 124 Cong. Rec. 30714, 30716, 36521, 36524. The word &ldquo;scheduled&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;pursuant to flight schedules&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;41509. Authority of the Secretary of Transportation to suspend, cancel, and reject tariffs for foreign air transportation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Cancellation and Rejection</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) On the initiative of the Secretary of Transportation or on a complaint filed with the Secretary, the Secretary may conduct a hearing to decide whether a price for foreign air transportation contained in an existing or newly filed tariff of an air carrier or foreign air carrier, a classification, rule, or practice affecting that price, or the value of the transportation provided under that price, is lawful. The Secretary may begin the hearing at once and without an answer or another formal pleading by the air carrier or foreign air carrier, but only after reasonable notice. If, after the hearing, the Secretary decides that the price, classification, rule, or practice is or will be unreasonable or unreasonably discriminatory, the Secretary may cancel or reject the tariff and prevent the use of the price, classification, rule, or practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With or without a hearing, the Secretary may cancel or reject an existing or newly filed tariff of a foreign air carrier and prevent the use of a price, classification, rule, or practice when the Secretary decides that the cancellation or rejection is in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In deciding whether to cancel or reject a tariff of an air carrier or foreign air carrier under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effect of the price on the movement of traffic;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the need in the public interest of adequate and efficient transportation by air carriers and foreign air carriers at the lowest cost consistent with providing the transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the standards prescribed under law related to the character and quality of transportation to be provided by air carriers and foreign air carriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the inherent advantages of transportation by aircraft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the need of the air carrier and foreign air carrier for revenue sufficient to enable the air carrier and foreign air carrier, under honest, economical, and efficient management, to provide adequate and efficient air carrier and foreign air carrier transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) whether the price will be predatory or tend to monopolize competition among air carriers and foreign air carriers in foreign air transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) reasonably estimated or foreseeable future costs and revenues for the air carrier or foreign air carrier for a reasonably limited future period during which the price would be in effect; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) other factors.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Suspension</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) Pending a decision under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary may suspend a tariff and the use of a price contained in the tariff or a classification, rule, or practice affecting that price.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may suspend a tariff of a foreign air carrier and the use of a price, classification, rule, or practice when the suspension is in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A suspension becomes effective when the Secretary files with the tariff and delivers to the air carrier or foreign air carrier affected by the suspension a written statement of the reasons for the suspension. To suspend a tariff, reasonable notice of the suspension must be given to the affected carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The suspension of a newly filed tariff may be for periods totaling not more than 365 days after the date the tariff otherwise would go into effect. The suspension of an existing tariff may be for periods totaling not more than 365 days after the effective date of the suspension. The Secretary may rescind at any time the suspension of a newly filed tariff and allow the price, classification, rule, or practice to go into effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Effective Tariffs and Prices When Tariff Is Suspended, Canceled, or Rejected</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If a tariff is suspended pending the outcome of a proceeding under subsection (a) of this section and the Secretary does not take final action in the proceeding during the suspension period, the tariff goes into effect at the end of that period subject to cancellation when the proceeding is concluded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) During the period of suspension, or after the cancellation or rejection, of a newly filed tariff (including a tariff that has gone into effect provisionally), the affected air carrier or foreign air carrier shall maintain in effect and use&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the corresponding seasonal prices, or the classifications, rules, and practices affecting those prices or the value of transportation provided under those prices, that were in effect for the carrier immediately before the new tariff was filed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) another price provided for under an applicable intergovernmental agreement or understanding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the suspended, canceled, or rejected tariff is the first tariff of the carrier for the covered transportation, the carrier, for the purpose of operations during the period of suspension or pending effectiveness of a new tariff, may file another tariff containing a price or another classification, rule, or practice affecting the price, or the value of the transportation provided under the price, that is in effect (and not subject to a suspension order) for any air carrier providing the same transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If an existing tariff is suspended or canceled, the affected air carrier or foreign air car<!-- PDFPage:653 -->rier, for the purpose of operations during the period of suspension or pending effectiveness of a new tariff, may file another tariff containing a price or another classification, rule, or practice affecting the price, or the value of the transportation provided under the price, that is in effect (and not subject to a suspension order) for any air carrier providing the same transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Response to Refusal of Foreign Country To Allow Air Carrier To Charge a Price</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the Secretary finds that the government or an aeronautical authority of a foreign country has refused to allow an air carrier to charge a price contained in a tariff filed and published under section 41504 of this title for foreign air transportation to the foreign country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary, without a hearing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may suspend any existing tariff of a foreign air carrier providing transportation between the United States and the foreign country for periods totaling not more than 365 days after the date of the suspension; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may order the foreign air carrier to charge, during the suspension periods, prices that are the same as those contained in a tariff (designated by the Secretary) of an air carrier filed and published under section 41504 of this title for foreign air transportation to the foreign country; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a foreign air carrier may continue to provide foreign air transportation to the foreign country only if the government or aeronautical authority of the foreign country allows an air carrier to start or continue foreign air transportation to the foreign country at the prices designated by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Standard Foreign Fare Level</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) In this subsection, &ldquo;standard foreign fare level&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) for a class of fares existing on October 1, 1979, the fare between 2 places (as adjusted under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph) filed for and allowed by the Civil Aeronautics Board to go into effect after September 30, 1979, and before August 13, 1980 (with seasonal fares adjusted by the percentage difference that prevailed between seasons in 1978), or the fare established under section 1002(j)(8) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85&ndash;726, 72 Stat. 731), as added by section 24(a) of the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979 (Public Law 96&ndash;192, 94 Stat. 46); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for a class of fares established after October 1, 1979, the fare between 2 places in effect on the effective date of the establishment of the new class.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) At least once every 60 days for fuel costs, and at least once every 180 days for other costs, the Secretary shall adjust the standard foreign fare level for the particular foreign air transportation to which the standard foreign fare level applies by increasing or decreasing that level by the percentage change from the last previous period in the actual operating cost for each available seat-mile. In adjusting a standard foreign fare level, the Secretary may not make an adjustment to costs actually incurred. In establishing a standard foreign fare level and making adjustments in the level under this paragraph, the Secretary may use all relevant or appropriate information reasonably available to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not decide that a proposed fare for foreign air transportation is unreasonable on the basis that the fare is too low or too high if the proposed fare is neither more than 5 percent higher nor 50 percent lower than the standard foreign fare level for the same or essentially similar class of transportation. The Secretary by regulation may increase the 50 percent specified in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Paragraph (2) of this subsection does not apply to a proposed fare that is not more than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 5 percent higher than the standard foreign fare level when the Secretary decides that the proposed fare may be unreasonably discriminatory or that suspension of the fare is in the public interest because of an unreasonable regulatory action by the government of a foreign country that is related to a fare proposal of an air carrier; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 50 percent lower than the standard foreign fare level when the Secretary decides that the proposed fare may be predatory or discriminatory or that suspension of the fare is required because of an unreasonable regulatory action by the government of a foreign country that is related to a fare proposal of an air carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Submission of Orders to President</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall submit to the President an order made under this section suspending, canceling, or rejecting a price for foreign air transportation, and an order rescinding the effectiveness of such an order, before publishing the order. Not later than 10 days after its submission, the President may disapprove the order on finding disapproval is necessary for United States foreign policy or national defense reasons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Compliance as Condition of Certificate or Permit</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section and compliance with an order of the Secretary under this section are conditions to any certificate or permit held by an air carrier or foreign air carrier. An air carrier or foreign air carrier may provide foreign air transportation only as long as the carrier maintains prices for that transportation that comply with this section and orders of the Secretary under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Operational authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If basic essential air service under subchapter II of this chapter is to be provided from an eligible point to a high density airport (other than Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport), the Secretary of Transportation shall ensure that the air carrier providing or selected to provide such service has sufficient operational authority at the high density airport to provide such service. The operational authority shall allow flights at reasonable times taking into account the needs of passengers with connecting flights.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If necessary to carry out the objectives of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall by order grant exemptions from the requirements of subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at high density airports), to air carriers using Stage 3 aircraft or to commuter air carriers, unless such an exemption would significantly increase operational delays.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Assurance of access</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary finds that an exemption under paragraph (2) would significantly increase operational delays, the Secretary shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that an air carrier providing or selected to provide basic essential air service is able to obtain access to a high density airport.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Action by the secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall issue a final order under this subsection on or before the 60th day after receiving a request from an air carrier for operational authority under this subsection.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Decisions Made Before October</cap-smallcap> 1, 1988.&mdash;For each eligible place for which a decision was made before October 1, 1988, under section 419 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, establishing the level of essential air transportation, the level of basic essential air service for that place shall be the level established by the Secretary of Transportation for that place by not later than December 29, 1988.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Decisions Not Made Before October</cap-smallcap> 1, 1988.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall decide on the level of basic essential air service for each eligible place for which a decision was not made before October 1, 1988, establishing the level of essential air transportation, when the Secretary receives notice that service to that place will be provided by only one air carrier. The Secretary shall make the decision by the last day of the 6-month period beginning on the date the Secretary receives the notice. The Secretary may impose notice requirements necessary to carry out this subsection. Before making a decision, the Secretary shall consider the views of any interested community and the appropriate State authority of the State in which the community is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Until the Secretary has made a decision on a level of basic essential air service for an eligible place under this subsection, the Secretary, on petition by an appropriate representative of the place, shall prohibit an air carrier from ending, suspending, or reducing air transportation to that place that appears to deprive the place of basic essential air service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Availability of Compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Secretary decides that basic essential air service will not be provided to an eligible place without compensation, the Secretary shall provide notice that an air carrier may apply to provide basic essential air service to the place for compensation under this section. In selecting an applicant, the Secretary shall consider, among other factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the demonstrated reliability of the applicant in providing scheduled air service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the contractual and marketing arrangements the applicant has made with a larger carrier to ensure service beyond the hub airport;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the interline arrangements that the applicant has made with a larger carrier to allow passengers and cargo of the applicant at the hub airport to be transported by the larger carrier through one reservation, ticket, and baggage check-in;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the preferences of the actual and potential users of air transportation at the eligible place, giving substantial weight to the views of the elected officials representing the users; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) for an eligible place in Alaska, the experience of the applicant in providing, in Alaska, scheduled air service, or significant patterns of non-scheduled air service under an exemption granted under section 40109(a) and (c)&ndash;(h) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under guidelines prescribed under section 41737(a) of this title, the Secretary shall pay the rate of compensation for providing basic essential air service under this section and section 41734 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Compensation Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall pay compensation under this section at times and in the way the Secretary decides is appropriate. The Secretary shall end payment of compensation to an air carrier for providing basic essential air service to an eligible place when the Secretary decides the compensation is no longer necessary to maintain basic essential air service to the place.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall review periodically the level of basic essential air service for each eligible place. Based on the review and consultations with an interested community and the appropriate State authority of the State in which the community is located, the Secretary may make appropriate adjustments in the level of service, to the extent such adjustments are to a level not less than the basic essential air service level established under subsection (a) for the airport that serves the community.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Notice Required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier may end, suspend, or reduce air transportation to an eligible place below the level of basic essential air service established for that place under section 41733 of this title only after giving the Secretary of Transportation, the appropriate State authority, and the affected communities at least 90 days&rsquo; notice before ending, suspending, or reducing that transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Continuation of Service for</cap-smallcap> 30 <cap-smallcap>Days After Notice Period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If at the end of the notice period under subsection (a) of this section the Secretary has not found another air carrier to provide basic essential air service to the eligible place, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing notice to continue to provide basic essential air service to the place for an additional 30-day period or until another carrier begins to provide basic essential air service to the place, whichever occurs first.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Proposals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A State or local government may submit a proposal to the Secretary of Transportation for enhanced essential air service to an eligible place for which basic essential air service is being provided under section 41733 of this title.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specify the level and type of enhanced essential air service the State or local government considers appropriate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) include an agreement related to compensation required for the proposed service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The agreement submitted under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall provide that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) the Government pay 100 percent of the compensation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if the proposed service is not successful for at least a 2-year period under the criteria prescribed by the Secretary under paragraph (3) of this subsection, the eligible place is not eligible for air service or air transportation for which compensation is paid by the Secretary under this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation objective criteria for deciding whether enhanced essential air service to an eligible place under this section is successful in terms of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) increasing passenger usage of the airport facilities at the place; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) reducing the amount of compensation provided by the Secretary under this subchapter for that service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Decisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 90 days after receiving a proposal under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Compensation Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall pay compensation under this section when and in the way the Secretary decides is appropriate. Compensation for enhanced essential air service under this section may be paid only for the costs incurred in providing air service to an eligible place that are in addition to the costs incurred in providing basic essential air service to the place under section 41733 of this title. The Secretary shall continue to pay compensation under this section only as long as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the air carrier maintains the level of enhanced essential air service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the State or local government or person agreeing to pay compensation under this section continues to pay the compensation; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall review periodically the enhanced essential air service provided to each eligible place under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For service for which the Government pays 50 percent of the compensation, based on the review and consultation with the affected community and the State or local government or person paying the remaining 50 percent of the compensation, the Secretary shall make appropriate adjustments in the type and level of service to the place.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For service for which the Government pays 100 percent of the compensation, based on the review and consultation with the State or local government submitting the proposal, the Secretary shall decide whether the service has succeeded for at least a 2-year period under the criteria prescribed under subsection (a)(3) of this section. If unsuccessful, the place is not eligible for air service or air transportation for which compensation is paid by the Secretary under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Ending, Suspending, and Reducing Air Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier may end, suspend, or reduce air transportation to an eligible place below the level of enhanced essential air service established for that place by the Secretary under this section only after giving the Secretary, the affected community, and the State or local government or person paying compensation for that service at least 30 days&rsquo; notice before ending, suspending, or reducing the service. This subsection does not relieve the carrier of an obligation under section 41734 of this title.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Compensation Guidelines</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe guidelines governing the rate of compensation payable under this subchapter. The guidelines shall be used to determine the reasonable amount of compensation required to ensure the continuation of air service or air transportation under this subchapter. The guidelines shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide for a reduction in compensation when an air carrier does not provide service or transportation agreed to be provided;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) consider amounts needed by an air carrier to promote public use of the service or transportation for which compensation is being paid; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) include expense elements based on representative costs of air carriers providing scheduled air transportation of passengers, property, and mail on aircraft of the type the Secretary decides is appropriate for providing the service or transportation for which compensation is being provided.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Promotional amounts described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall be a special, segregated element of the compensation provided to a carrier under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Required Finding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may pay compensation to an air carrier for providing air service or air transportation under this subchapter only if the Secretary finds the carrier is able to provide the service or transportation in a reliable way.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Claims</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 15 days after receiving a written claim from an air carrier for compensation under this subchapter, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) pay or deny the United States Government's share of a claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if denying the claim, notify the carrier of the denial and the reasons for the denial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Make Agreements and Incur Obligations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may <!-- PDFPage:678 -->make agreements and incur obligations from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund established under section 9502 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 9502) to pay compensation under this subchapter. An agreement by the Secretary under this subsection is a contractual obligation of the Government to pay the Government's share of the compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not more than $38,600,000 is available to the Secretary out of the Fund for each of the fiscal years ending September 30, 1993&ndash;1998, to incur obligations under this section. Amounts made available under this section remain available until expended.</p>

<p class="note-body">In this section, the word &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;fix and determine&rdquo; and &ldquo;fixing and determining&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;fair and reasonable&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate an unnecessary word. See the revision notes following 49:10101.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is substituted for 49 App.:1551(b)(1)(D) to make clear that the United States Postal Service derives its authority to provide for the transportation of mail by aircraft in interstate transportation from 39:5402(d) and (f). The text of 49 App.:1376(a) (1st sentence related to non-Alaska interstate and overseas air transportation less words between parentheses) is omitted as superseded by 39:5402(d).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;Except as provided in section 5402 of title 39&rdquo; are added for clarity. The words &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; in 49 App.:1376(a) are omitted as surplus. The text of 49 App.:1376(a) (2d, last sentences) is omitted as executed. In clauses (1) and (2), the word &ldquo;prices&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;rates of compensation&rdquo; for consistency in this part. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;an opportunity for a hearing on the record&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;hearing&rdquo; for clarity and consistency with subsection (f) of this section. The words &ldquo;to be paid by the Postal Service&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;The United States Postal Service shall make payments .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of so much of the total compensation as is fixed and determined by the Board under this section without regard to clause (3) of subsection (b) of this section&rdquo; in 49 App.:1376(c) to eliminate unnecessary words because the text of 49 App.:1376(b) (2d sentence words after 2d semicolon) is being omitted. See the revision notes for subsection (d) of this section. The words &ldquo;out of appropriations for the transportation of mail by aircraft&rdquo; are omitted as being superseded by chapters 20 and 24 of title 39, United States Code. The text of 49 App.:1376(c) (2d sentence) is omitted as expired because of 49 App.:1376(c) (last sentence). The text of 49 App.:1376(c) (last sentence) is omitted as executed. The words &ldquo;and to make such rates effective from such date as it shall determine to be proper&rdquo; in 49 App.:1376(a) are omitted because the power to determine when rates go into effect is included in the power to prescribe rates. The words &ldquo;transportation of mail by aircraft in foreign air transportation or between places in Alaska&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;transportation of mail by aircraft&rdquo; because 49 App.:1551(b)(1)(D) and (E) provides that transportation of mail in interstate or overseas air transportation (except transportation of mail between 2 places in Alaska) is transferred to the jurisdiction of the United States Postal Service leaving the balance of authority under 49 App.:1376(a) with the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (c), (d), and (f), reference to service provided by the Postal Service is omitted as obsolete because of 39:5402(d).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;In prescribing prices under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary&rdquo; are added for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the text of 49 App.:1376(b) (2d sentence words after 2d semicolon, 5th&ndash;7th sentences) and (d) is omitted as obsolete because under 49 App.:1376(c) and 1376a, payments by the Board under 49 App.:1376 were terminated. The text of 49 App.:1376(b) (3d, 4th sentences) is omitted as obsolete because it applies only to rates paid for service performed between October 24, 1978, and January 1, 1983. The text of 49 App.:1376(b) (last sentence) is omitted as executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (g) is substituted for 49 App.:1551(b)(3) and 1553(c) because the date on which the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to provide for the transportation of mail by aircraft expires is set out in 39:5402(f). The source provisions of 49 App.:1551(b)(3) providing for the transfer of that authority from the Secretary to the Postal Service are restated in section 5(k) of this bill.</p>

Upon receipt of such a complaint, the Secretary of Labor shall notify, in writing, the person named in the complaint and the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration of the filing of the complaint, of the allegations contained in the complaint, of the substance of evidence supporting the complaint, and of the opportunities that will be afforded to such person under paragraph (2).</p>

If the Secretary of Labor concludes that there is a reasonable cause to believe that a violation of subsection (a) has occurred, the Secretary shall accompany the Secretary's findings with a preliminary order providing the relief prescribed by paragraph (3)(B). Not later than 30 days after the date of notification of findings under this paragraph, either the person alleged to have committed the violation or the complainant may file objections to the findings or preliminary order, or both, and request a hearing on the record. The filing of such objections shall not operate to stay any reinstatement remedy contained in the preliminary order. Such hearings shall be conducted expeditiously. If a hearing is not requested in such 30-day period, the preliminary order shall be deemed a final order that is not subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Requirements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Showing by employer</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding a finding by the Secretary that the complainant has made the showing required under clause (i), no investigation otherwise required under subparagraph (A) shall be conducted if the employer demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that behavior.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Criteria for determination by secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may determine that a violation of subsection (a) has occurred only if the complainant demonstrates that any behavior described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a) was a contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Relief may not be ordered under subparagraph (A) if the employer demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the employer would have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that behavior.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Deadline for issuance; settlement agreements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 120 days after the date of conclusion of a hearing under paragraph (2), the Secretary of Labor shall issue a final order providing the relief prescribed by this paragraph or denying the complaint.

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) provide compensatory damages to the complainant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">If such an order is issued under this paragraph, the Secretary of Labor, at the request of the complainant, shall assess against the person against whom the order is issued a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; and expert witness fees) reasonably incurred, as determined by the Secretary of Labor, by the complainant for, or in connection with, the bringing the complaint upon which the order was issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Frivolous complaints</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary of Labor finds that a complaint under paragraph (1) is frivolous or has been brought in bad faith, the Secretary of Labor may award to the prevailing employer a reasonable attorney's fee not exceeding $1,000.</p>

The petition for review must be filed not later than 60 days after the date of the issuance of the final order of the Secretary of Labor. Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. The commencement of proceedings under this subparagraph shall not, unless ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on collateral attack</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An order of the Secretary of Labor with respect to which review could have been obtained under subparagraph (A) shall not be subject to judicial review in any criminal or other civil proceeding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement of order by secretary of labor</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever any person has failed to comply with an order issued under paragraph (3), the Secretary of Labor may file a civil action in the United States district court for the district in which the violation was found to occur to enforce such order.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Commencement of action</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person on whose behalf an order was issued under paragraph (3) may commence a civil action against the person to whom such order was issued to require compliance with such order. The appropriate United States district court shall have jurisdiction, without regard to the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to enforce such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Attorney fees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The court, in issuing any final order under this paragraph, may award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) to any party whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Mandamus</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any nondiscretionary duty imposed by this section shall be enforceable in a mandamus proceeding brought under section 1361 of title 28, United States Code.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Revocations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall issue an order revoking the certificate of registration for an aircraft issued to an owner under section 44103 of this title and any other certificate of registration that the owner of the aircraft holds under section 44103, if the Administrator finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the aircraft was used to carry out, or facilitate, an activity that is punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year under a law of the United States or a State related to a controlled substance (except a law related to simple possession of a controlled substance); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the owner of the aircraft permitted the use of the aircraft knowing that the aircraft was to be used for the activity described in clause (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An aircraft owner that is not an individual is deemed to have permitted the use of the aircraft knowing that the aircraft was to be used for the activity described in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection only if a majority of the individuals who control the owner of the aircraft or who are involved in forming the major policy of the owner permitted the use of the aircraft knowing that the aircraft was to be used for the activity described in paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Advice to Holders and Opportunity To Answer</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before the Administrator revokes a certificate under subsection (b) of this section, the Administrator shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) advise the holder of the certificate of the charges or reasons on which the Administrator bases the proposed action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide the holder of the certificate an opportunity to answer the charges and state why the certificate should not be revoked.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Appeals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person whose certificate is revoked by the Administrator under subsection (b) of this section may appeal the revocation order to the National Transportation Safety Board. The Board shall affirm or reverse the order after providing notice and a hearing on the record. In conducting the hearing, the Board is not bound by the findings of fact of the Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When a person files an appeal with the Board under this subsection, the order of the Administrator revoking the certificate is stayed. However, if the Administrator advises the Board that safety in air transportation or air commerce requires the immediate effectiveness of the order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the order remains effective; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Acquittal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator may not revoke, and the Board may not affirm a revocation of, a certificate of registration under this section on the basis of an activity described in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section if the holder of the certificate is acquitted of all charges related to a controlled substance in an indictment or information arising from the activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Administrator has revoked a certificate of registration of a person under this section because of an activity described in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section, the Administrator shall reissue a certificate to the person if the person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) subsequently is acquitted of all charges related to a controlled substance in an indictment or information arising from the activity; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Insurance and Reinsurance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Subject to subsection (c) of this section and section 44305(a) of this title, the Secretary of Transportation may provide insurance and reinsurance against loss or damage arising out of any risk from the operation of an American aircraft or foreign-flag aircraft.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An aircraft may be insured or reinsured for not more than its reasonable value as determined by the Secretary in accordance with reasonable business practices in the commercial aviation insurance industry. Insurance or reinsurance may be provided only when the Secretary decides that the insurance cannot be obtained on reasonable terms from an insurance carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Reimbursement of Insurance Cost Increases.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may reimburse an air carrier for the increase in the cost of insurance, with respect to a premium for coverage ending before October 1, 2002, against loss or damage arising out of any risk from the operation of an American aircraft over the insurance premium that was in effect for a comparable operation during the period beginning September 4, 2001, and ending September 10, 2001, as the Secretary may determine. Such reimbursement is subject to subsections (a)(2), (c), and (d) of this section and to section 44303.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Payment from revolving fund</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A reimbursement under this subsection shall be paid from the revolving fund established by section 44307.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:703 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Further conditions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may impose such further conditions on insurance for which the increase in premium is subject to reimbursement under this subsection as the Secretary may deem appropriate in the interest of air commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Termination of authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority to reimburse air carriers under this subsection shall expire 180 days after the date of enactment of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Presidential Approval</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may provide insurance or reinsurance under subsection (a) of this section, or reimburse an air carrier under subsection (b) of this section, only with the approval of the President. The President may approve the insurance or reinsurance or the reimbursement only after deciding that the continued operation of the American aircraft or foreign-flag aircraft to be insured or reinsured is necessary in the interest of air commerce or national security or to carry out the foreign policy of the United States Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The President may require the Secretary to consult with interested departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Government before providing insurance or reinsurance or reimbursing an air carrier under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Additional Insurance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;With the approval of the Secretary, a person having an insurable interest in an aircraft may insure with other underwriters in an amount that is more than the amount insured with the Secretary. However, the Secretary may not benefit from the additional insurance. This subsection does not prevent the Secretary from making contracts of coinsurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Extension of Policies.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall extend through August 31, 2003, and may extend through December 31, 2003, the termination date of any insurance policy that the Department of Transportation issued to an air carrier under subsection (a) and that is in effect on the date of enactment of this subsection on no less favorable terms to the air carrier than existed on June 19, 2002; except that the Secretary shall amend the insurance policy, subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, to add coverage for losses or injuries to aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew at the limits carried by air carriers for such losses and injuries as of such date of enactment and at an additional premium comparable to the premium charged for third-party casualty coverage under such policy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Special rules</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in no event shall the total premium paid by the air carrier for the policy, as amended, be more than twice the premium that the air carrier was paying to the Department of Transportation for its third party policy as of June 19, 2002; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the coverage in such policy shall begin with the first dollar of any covered loss that is incurred.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Type Certificates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall issue a type certificate for an aircraft, aircraft engine, or propeller, or for an appliance specified under paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection when the Administrator finds that the aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance is properly designed and manufactured, performs properly, and meets the regulations and minimum standards prescribed under section 44701(a) of this title. On receiving an application for a type certificate, the Administrator shall investigate the application and may conduct a hearing. The Administrator shall make, or require the applicant to make, tests the Administrator considers necessary in the interest of safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specify in regulations those appliances that reasonably require a type certificate in the interest of safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) include in a type certificate terms required in the interest of safety; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) record on the certificate a numerical specification of the essential factors related to the performance of the aircraft, aircraft engine, or propeller for which the certificate is issued.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Issuance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may issue a type certificate designated as a supplemental type certificate for a change to an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Contents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A supplemental type certificate issued under paragraph (1) shall consist of the change to the aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance with respect to the previously issued type certificate for the aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the holder of a supplemental type certificate agrees to permit another person to use the certificate to modify an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance, the holder shall provide the other person with written evidence, in a form acceptable to the Administrator, of that agreement. A person may change an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance based on a supplemental type certificate only if the person requesting the change is the holder of the supplemental type certificate or has permission from the holder to make the change.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Production Certificates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall issue a production certificate authorizing the production of a duplicate of an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance for which a type certificate has been issued when the Administrator finds the duplicate will conform to the certificate. On receiving an application, the Administrator shall inspect, and may require testing of, a duplicate to ensure that it conforms to the requirements of the certificate. The Administrator may include in a production certificate terms required in the interest of safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Airworthiness Certificates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The registered owner of an aircraft may apply to the Administrator for an airworthiness certificate for the aircraft. The Administrator shall issue <!-- PDFPage:734 -->an airworthiness certificate when the Administrator finds that the aircraft conforms to its type certificate and, after inspection, is in condition for safe operation. The Administrator shall register each airworthiness certificate and may include appropriate information in the certificate. The certificate number or other individual designation the Administrator requires shall be displayed on the aircraft. The Administrator may include in an airworthiness certificate terms required in the interest of safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person applying for the issuance or renewal of an airworthiness certificate for an aircraft for which ownership has not been recorded under section 44107 or 44110 of this title must submit with the application information related to the ownership of the aircraft the Administrator decides is necessary to identify each person having a property interest in the aircraft and the kind and extent of the interest.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;44710. Revocations of airman certificates for controlled substance violations</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, &ldquo;controlled substance&rdquo; has the same meaning given that term in section 102 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 802).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Revocation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall issue an order revoking an airman certificate issued an individual under section 44703 of this title after the individual is convicted, under a law of the United States or a State related to a controlled substance (except a law related to simple possession of a controlled substance), of an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year if the Administrator finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an aircraft was used to commit, or facilitate the commission of, the offense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the individual served as an airman, or was on the aircraft, in connection with committing, or facilitating the commission of, the offense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator shall issue an order revoking an airman certificate issued an individual under section 44703 of this title if the Administrator finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the individual knowingly carried out an activity punishable, under a law of the United States or a State related to a controlled substance (except a law related to simple possession of a controlled substance), by death or imprisonment for more than one year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an aircraft was used to carry out or facilitate the activity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the individual served as an airman, or was on the aircraft, in connection with carrying out, or facilitating the carrying out of, the activity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator has no authority under paragraph (1) of this subsection to review whether an airman violated a law of the United States or a State related to a controlled substance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Advice to Holders and Opportunity To Answer</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before the Administrator revokes a certificate under subsection (b) of this section, the Administrator must&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:739 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) advise the holder of the certificate of the charges or reasons on which the Administrator relies for the proposed revocation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide the holder of the certificate an opportunity to answer the charges and be heard why the certificate should not be revoked.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Appeals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An individual whose certificate is revoked by the Administrator under subsection (b) of this section may appeal the revocation order to the National Transportation Safety Board. The Board shall affirm or reverse the order after providing notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the record. When conducting the hearing, the Board is not bound by findings of fact of the Administrator but shall be bound by all validly adopted interpretations of laws and regulations the Administrator carries out and of written agency policy guidance available to the public related to sanctions to be imposed under this section unless the Board finds an interpretation is arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not according to law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When an individual files an appeal with the Board under this subsection, the order of the Administrator revoking the certificate is stayed. However, if the Administrator advises the Board that safety in air transportation or air commerce requires the immediate effectiveness of the order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the order remains effective; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Board shall make a final disposition of the appeal not later than 60 days after the Administrator so advises the Board.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An individual substantially affected by an order of the Board under this subsection, or the Administrator when the Administrator decides that an order of the Board will have a significant adverse effect on carrying out this part, may obtain judicial review of the order under section 46110 of this title. The Administrator shall be made a party to the judicial review proceedings. Findings of fact of the Board are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Acquittal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator may not revoke, and the Board may not affirm a revocation of, an airman certificate under subsection (b)(2) of this section on the basis of an activity described in subsection (b)(2)(A) if the holder of the certificate is acquitted of all charges related to a controlled substance in an indictment or information arising from the activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Administrator has revoked an airman certificate under this section because of an activity described in subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section, the Administrator shall reissue a certificate to the individual if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the individual otherwise satisfies the requirements for a certificate under section 44703 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) the individual subsequently is acquitted of all charges related to a controlled substance in an indictment or information arising from the activity; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the conviction on which a revocation under subsection (b)(1) of this section is based is reversed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Waivers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may waive the requirement of subsection (b) of this section that an airman certificate of an individual be revoked if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a law enforcement official of the United States Government or of a State requests a waiver; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Administrator decides that the waiver will facilitate law enforcement efforts.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Duties of Inspectors</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall employ inspectors who shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) inspect aircraft, aircraft engines, propellers, and appliances designed for use in air transportation, during manufacture and when in use by an air carrier in air transportation, to enable the Administrator to decide whether the aircraft, aircraft engines, propellers, or appliances are in safe condition and maintained properly; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) advise and cooperate with the air carrier during that inspection and maintenance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the excessive period of time required to receive the forms at the Airmen and Aircraft Registry of the Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the backlog of forms waiting for processing at the Registry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the lack of ready access by law enforcement officials to information contained on the forms.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall prescribe regulations to carry out paragraph (1) of this subsection and provide a written explanation of how the regulations address each of the deficiencies and abuses described in paragraph (1).

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Deadlines for deployment.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Initial phase</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The initial phase of the operational deployment of the system developed under this subsection shall begin not later than December 31, 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Final phase</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The final phase of field deployment of the system developed under this subsection shall begin not later than December 31, 1999.

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Administrator, as the Administrator deems appropriate, shall provide for the participation of a representative of the Environmental Protection Agency on such advisory committees or associated working groups that advise the Administrator on matters related to the environmental effects of aircraft and aircraft engines.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may prescribe standards and regulations under this subsection only after consulting with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The standards and regulations shall be applied when issuing, amending, modifying, suspending, or revoking a certificate authorized under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An original type certificate may be issued under section 44704(a) of this title for an aircraft for which substantial noise abatement can be achieved only after the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration prescribes standards and regulations under this section that apply to that aircraft.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Considerations and Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When prescribing a standard or regulation under this section, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:744 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consider relevant information related to aircraft noise and sonic boom;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consult with appropriate departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States Government and State and interstate authorities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) consider whether the standard or regulation is consistent with the highest degree of safety in air transportation or air commerce in the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) consider whether the standard or regulation is economically reasonable, technologically practicable, and appropriate for the applicable aircraft, aircraft engine, appliance, or certificate; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) substantially the same as the proposed regulations submitted by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that amend the proposed regulations; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) publish in the Federal Register&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a notice that no regulation is being prescribed in response to the proposed regulations of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a detailed analysis of, and response to, all information the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency submitted with the proposed regulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a detailed explanation of why no regulation is being prescribed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Consultation and Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency believes that the action of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration under subsection (c)(1)(B) or (2) of this section does not protect the public health and welfare from aircraft noise or sonic boom, consistent with the considerations in subsection (b) of this section, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall consult with the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and may request a report on the advisability of prescribing the regulation as originally proposed. The request, including a detailed statement of the information on which the request is based, shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall report to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency within the time, if any, specified in the request. However, the time specified must be at least 90 days after the date of the request. The report shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be accompanied by a detailed statement of the findings of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the reasons for the findings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) identify any statement related to an action under subsection (c) of this section filed under section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C));</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Under Secretary of Transportation for Security shall provide for the screening of all passengers and property, including United States mail, cargo, carry-on and checked baggage, and other articles, that will be carried aboard a passenger aircraft operated by an air carrier or foreign air carrier in air transportation or intrastate air transportation. In the case of flights and flight segments originating in the United States, the screening shall take place before boarding and shall be carried out by a Federal Government employee (as defined in section 2105 of title 5, United States Code), except as otherwise provided in section 44919 or 44920 and except for identifying passengers and baggage for screening under the CAPPS and known shipper programs and conducting positive bag-match programs.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:756 --><p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Supervision of Screening</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;All screening of passengers and property at airports in the United States where screening is required under this section shall be supervised by uniformed Federal personnel of the Transportation Security Administration who shall have the power to order the dismissal of any individual performing such screening.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Checked Baggage</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A system must be in operation to screen all checked baggage at all airports in the United States as soon as practicable but not later than the 60th day following the date of enactment of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Explosive Detection Systems.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Under Secretary of Transportation for Security shall take all necessary action to ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) explosive detection systems are deployed as soon as possible to ensure that all United States airports described in section 44903(c) have sufficient explosive detection systems to screen all checked baggage no later than December 31, 2002, and that as soon as such systems are in place at an airport, all checked baggage at the airport is screened by those systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) all systems deployed under subparagraph (A) are fully utilized; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if explosive detection equipment at an airport is unavailable, all checked baggage is screened by an alternative means.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Deadline.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, in his discretion or at the request of an airport, the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security determines that the Transportation Security Administration is not able to deploy explosive detection systems required to be deployed under paragraph (1) at all airports where explosive detection systems are required by December 31, 2002, then with respect to each airport for which the Under Secretary makes that determination&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the Under Secretary shall submit to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure a detailed plan (which may be submitted in classified form) for the deployment of the number of explosive detection systems at that airport necessary to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) as soon as practicable at that airport but in no event later than December 31, 2003; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Under Secretary shall take all necessary action to ensure that alternative means of screening all checked baggage is implemented until the requirements of paragraph (1) have been met.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Criteria for determination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In making a determination under subparagraph (A), the Under Secretary shall take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the nature and extent of the required modifications to the airport's terminal buildings, and the technical, engineering, design and construction issues;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the need to ensure that such installations and modifications are effective; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of deploying explosive detection systems in the baggage sorting area or other non-public area rather than the lobby of an airport terminal building.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Response</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Under Secretary shall respond to the request of an airport under subparagraph (A) within 14 days of receiving the request. A denial of request shall create no right of appeal or judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Airport effort required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each airport with respect to which the Under Secretary makes a determination under subparagraph (A) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) cooperate fully with the Transportation Security Administration with respect to screening checked baggage and changes to accommodate explosive detection systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) make security projects a priority for the obligation or expenditure of funds made available under chapter 417 or 471 until explosive detection systems required to be deployed under paragraph (1) have been deployed at that airport.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Until the Transportation Security Administration has met the requirements of paragraph (1), the Under Secretary shall submit a classified report every 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure describing the progress made toward meeting such requirements at each airport.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Mandatory Screening Where EDS Not Yet Available</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As soon as practicable but not later than the 60th day following the date of enactment of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act and until the requirements of subsection (b)(1)(A) are met, the Under Secretary shall require alternative means for screening any piece of checked baggage that is not screened by an explosive detection system. Such alternative means may include 1 or more of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A bag-match program that ensures that no checked baggage is placed aboard an aircraft unless the passenger who checked the baggage is aboard the aircraft.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Manual search.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Search by canine explosive detection units in combination with other means.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Other means or technology approved by the Under Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Cargo Deadline</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A system must be in operation to screen, inspect, or otherwise ensure the security of all cargo that is to be transported in all-cargo aircraft in air transportation and intrastate air transportation as soon as practicable after the date of enactment of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Deployment of Armed Personnel.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Under Secretary shall order the deployment of law enforcement personnel authorized to carry firearms at each airport security screening location to ensure passenger safety and national security.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Minimum requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except at airports required to enter into agreements under <!-- PDFPage:757 -->subsection (c), the Under Secretary shall order the deployment of at least 1 law enforcement officer at each airport security screening location. At the 100 largest airports in the United States, in terms of annual passenger enplanements for the most recent calendar year for which data are available, the Under Secretary shall order the deployment of additional law enforcement personnel at airport security screening locations if the Under Secretary determines that the additional deployment is necessary to ensure passenger safety and national security.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions and Advising Congress on Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Under Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may exempt from this section air transportation operations, except scheduled passenger operations of an air carrier providing air transportation under a certificate issued under section 41102 of this title or a permit issued under section 41302 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall advise Congress of a regulation to be prescribed under this section at least 30 days before the effective date of the regulation, unless the Under Secretary decides an emergency exists requiring the regulation to become effective in fewer than 30 days and notifies Congress of that decision.</p>

When deciding whether additional personnel are needed, the Under Secretary shall consider the number of passengers boarded at the airport, the extent of anticipated risk of criminal violence or aircraft piracy at the airport or to the air carrier aircraft operations at the airport, and the availability of qualified State or local law enforcement personnel at the airport.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Under Secretary may approve a security program of an airport operator, or an amendment in an existing program, that incorporates a security program of an airport tenant (except an air carrier separately complying with part 108 or 129 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations) having access to a secured area of the airport, if the program or amendment incorporates&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the methods the airport operator will use to monitor and audit the tenant's compliance with the security requirements and provides that the tenant will be required to pay monetary penalties to the airport operator if the tenant fails to carry out a security requirement under a contractual provision or requirement imposed by the airport operator.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Under Secretary approves a program or amendment described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the airport operator may not be found to be in violation of a requirement of this subsection or subsection (b) of this section when the airport operator demonstrates that the tenant or an employee, permittee, or invitee of the tenant is responsible for the violation and that the airport operator has complied with all measures in its security program for securing compliance with its security program by the tenant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to carry firearms; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to make arrests without warrant for an offense against the United States committed in the presence of the individual or for a felony under the laws of the United States, if the individual reasonably believes the individual to be arrested has committed or is committing a felony.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

In making that decision, the Under Secretary shall consider factors such as the ability of the equipment alone, or as part of an integrated system, to detect under realistic air carrier operating conditions the amounts, configurations, and types of explosive material that would likely be used to cause catastrophic damage to commercial aircraft. The Under Secretary shall notify the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives of a deployment decision made under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Until such time as the Under Secretary determines that equipment certified under paragraph (1) is commercially available and has successfully completed operational testing as provided in paragraph (1), the Under Secretary shall facilitate the deployment of such approved commercially available explosive detection devices as the Under Secretary determines will enhance aviation security significantly. The Under Secretary shall require that equipment deployed under this paragraph be replaced by equipment certified under paragraph (1) when equipment certified under paragraph (1) becomes commercially available. The Under Secretary is authorized, based on operational considerations at individual airports, to waive the required installation of commercially available equipment under paragraph (1) in the interests of aviation security. The Under Secretary may permit the requirements of this paragraph to be met at airports by the deployment of dogs or other appropriate animals to supplement equipment for screening passengers, baggage, mail, or cargo for explosives or weapons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This subsection does not prohibit the Under Secretary from purchasing or deploying explosive detection equipment described in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Grants</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may provide grants to continue the Explosive Detection K-9 Team Training Program to detect explosives at airports and on aircraft.</p>

The words &ldquo;National Transportation Safety Board&rdquo; <!-- PDFPage:806 -->were substituted for &ldquo;Board&rdquo; in 49 App.:1481 (4th sentence) because 49 App.:1655(d) transferred all functions, duties, and powers of the Civil Aeronautics Board under titles VI and VII of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85&ndash;726, 72 Stat. 775) to the Secretary of Transportation to be carried out through the former National Transportation Safety Board in the Department of Transportation. Title VI includes sections 602 and 609 [49 App.:1422, 1429], that provide for appeals to the Civil Aeronautics Board (subsequently transferred to the National Transportation Safety Board), and section 611(e) [49 App.:1431(e)], that provides for appeals to the National Transportation Safety Board. Under 49 App.:1902(a), the National Transportation Safety Board in the Department of Transportation was replaced by an independent National Transportation Safety Board outside the Department, and 49 App.:1903(a)(9)(A) gave the independent Board the authority to review appeals from actions of the Secretary under 49 App.:1422, 1429, and 1431(e).</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the safe operation of the airport and airway system is the highest aviation priority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that aviation facilities be constructed and operated to minimize current and projected noise impact on nearby communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to give special emphasis to developing reliever airports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that appropriate provisions should be made to make the development and enhancement of cargo hub airports easier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to encourage the development of intermodal connections on airport property between aeronautical and other transportation modes and systems to serve air transportation passengers and cargo efficiently and effectively and promote economic development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) that airport development projects under this subchapter provide for the protection and enhancement of natural resources and the quality of the environment of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) that airport construction and improvement projects that increase the capacity of facilities to accommodate passenger and cargo traffic be undertaken to the maximum feasible extent so that safety and efficiency increase and delays decrease;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) to ensure that nonaviation usage of the navigable airspace be accommodated but not allowed to decrease the safety and capacity of the airspace and airport system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) that artificial restrictions on airport capacity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are not in the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) should be imposed to alleviate air traffic delays only after other reasonably available and less burdensome alternatives have been tried; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) should not discriminate unjustly between categories and classes of aircraft;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) that special emphasis should be placed on converting appropriate former military air bases to civil use and identifying and improving additional joint-use facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) that the airport improvement program should be administered to encourage projects that employ innovative technology (including integrated in-pavement lighting systems for runways and taxiways and other runway and <!-- PDFPage:831 -->taxiway incursion prevention devices), concepts, and approaches that will promote safety, capacity, and efficiency improvements in the construction of airports and in the air transportation system (including the development and use of innovative concrete and other materials in the construction of airport facilities to minimize initial laydown costs, minimize time out of service, and maximize lifecycle durability) and to encourage and solicit innovative technology proposals and activities in the expenditure of funding pursuant to this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) that airport fees, rates, and charges must be reasonable and may only be used for purposes not prohibited by this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) that airports should be as self-sustaining as possible under the circumstances existing at each particular airport and in establishing new fees, rates, and charges, and generating revenues from all sources, airport owners and operators should not seek to create revenue surpluses that exceed the amounts to be used for airport system purposes and for other purposes for which airport revenues may be spent under section 47107(b)(1) of this title, including reasonable reserves and other funds to facilitate financing and cover contingencies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>National Transportation Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) It is a goal of the United States to develop a national intermodal transportation system that transports passengers and property in an efficient manner. The future economic direction of the United States depends on its ability to confront directly the enormous challenges of the global economy, declining productivity growth, energy vulnerability, air pollution, and the need to rebuild the infrastructure of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) United States leadership in the world economy, the expanding wealth of the United States, the competitiveness of the industry of the United States, the standard of living, and the quality of life are at stake.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A national intermodal transportation system is a coordinated, flexible network of diverse but complementary forms of transportation that transports passengers and property in the most efficient manner. By reducing transportation costs, these intermodal systems will enhance the ability of the industry of the United States to compete in the global marketplace.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) All forms of transportation, including aviation and other transportation systems of the future, will be full partners in the effort to reduce energy consumption and air pollution while promoting economic development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) An intermodal transportation system consists of transportation hubs that connect different forms of appropriate transportation and provides users with the most efficient means of transportation and with access to commercial centers, business locations, population centers, and the vast rural areas of the United States, as well as providing links to other forms of transportation and to intercity connections.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Intermodality and flexibility are paramount issues in the process of developing an integrated system that will obtain the optimum yield of United States resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The United States transportation infrastructure must be reshaped to provide the economic underpinnings for the United States to compete in the 21st century global economy. The United States can no longer rely on the sheer size of its economy to dominate international economic rivals and must recognize fully that its economy is no longer a separate entity but is part of the global marketplace. The future economic prosperity of the United States depends on its ability to compete in an international marketplace that is teeming with competitors but in which a full one-quarter of the economic activity of the United States takes place.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The United States must make a national commitment to rebuild its infrastructure through development of a national intermodal transportation system. The United States must provide the foundation for its industries to improve productivity and their ability to compete in the global economy with a system that will transport passengers and property in an efficient manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Capacity Expansion and Noise Abatement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is in the public interest to recognize the effects of airport capacity expansion projects on aircraft noise. Efforts to increase capacity through any means can have an impact on surrounding communities. Noncompatible land uses around airports must be reduced and efforts to mitigate noise must be given a high priority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Consistency With Air Commerce and Safety Policies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each airport and airway program should be carried out consistently with section 40101(a), (b), (d), and (f) of this title to foster competition, prevent unfair methods of competition in air transportation, maintain essential air transportation, and prevent unjust and discriminatory practices, including as the practices may be applied between categories and classes of aircraft.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Adequacy of Navigation Aids and Airport Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subchapter should be carried out to provide adequate navigation aids and airport facilities for places at which scheduled commercial air service is provided. The facilities provided may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) reliever airports; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) heliports designated by the Secretary of Transportation to relieve congestion at commercial service airports by diverting aircraft passengers from fixed-wing aircraft to helicopter carriers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Use of Safety Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subchapter should be carried out consistently with a comprehensive airspace system plan, giving highest priority to commercial service airports, to maximize the use of safety facilities, including installing, operating, and maintaining, to the extent possible with available money and considering other safety needs&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) electronic or visual vertical guidance on each runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) grooving or friction treatment of each primary and secondary runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) distance-to-go signs for each primary and secondary runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a precision approach system, a vertical visual guidance system, and a full approach light system for each primary runway;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:832 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a nonprecision instrument approach for each secondary runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) runway end identifier lights on each runway that does not have an approach light system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) a surface movement radar system at each category III airport;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) a taxiway lighting and sign system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) runway edge lighting and marking;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) radar approach coverage for each airport terminal area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) runway and taxiway incursion prevention devices, including integrated in-pavement lighting systems for runways and taxiways.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Intermodal Planning</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To carry out the policy of subsection (a)(5) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall take each of the following actions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Coordination in development of airport plans and programs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Cooperate with State and local officials in developing airport plans and programs that are based on overall transportation needs. The airport plans and programs shall be developed in coordination with other transportation planning and considering comprehensive long-range land-use plans and overall social, economic, environmental, system performance, and energy conservation objectives. The process of developing airport plans and programs shall be continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive to the degree appropriate to the complexity of the transportation problems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Goals for airport master and system plans</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Encourage airport sponsors and State and local officials to develop airport master plans and airport system plans that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) foster effective coordination between aviation planning and metropolitan planning;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) include an evaluation of aviation needs within the context of multimodal planning; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) are integrated with metropolitan plans to ensure that airport development proposals include adequate consideration of land use and ground transportation access.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Representation of airport operators on mpo's</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Encourage metropolitan planning organizations, particularly in areas with populations greater than 200,000, to establish membership positions for airport operators.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To carry out the policy of subsection (a)(6) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall consult with the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency about any project included in a project grant application involving the location of an airport or runway, or a major runway extension, that may have a significant effect on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) natural resources, including fish and wildlife;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) natural, scenic, and recreation assets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) water and air quality; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) another factor affecting the environment.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Submission and Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An application for a project grant under this subchapter may be submitted to the Secretary of Transportation by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a sponsor; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a State, as the only sponsor, for an airport development project benefitting 1 or more airports in the State or for airport planning for projects for 1 or more airports in the State if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the sponsor of each airport gives written consent that the State be the applicant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the Secretary is satisfied there is administrative merit and aeronautical benefit in the State being the sponsor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) an acceptable agreement exists that ensures that the State will comply with appropriate grant conditions and other assurances the Secretary requires.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before deciding to undertake an airport development project at an airport under this subchapter, a sponsor shall consult with the airport users that will be affected by the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection does not authorize a public agency that is subject to the laws of a State to apply for a project grant in violation of a law of the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Contents and Form</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An application for a project grant under this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall describe the project proposed to be undertaken;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may propose a project only for a public-use airport included in the current national plan of integrated airport systems;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) shall be in the form and contain other information the Secretary prescribes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>State Standards for Airport Development</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may approve standards (except standards for safety of approaches) that a State prescribes for airport development at nonprimary public-use airports in the State. On approval under this subsection, a State's standards apply to the nonprimary public-use airports in the State instead of the comparable standards prescribed by the Secretary under subsection (b)(3) of this section. The Secretary, or the State with the approval of the Secretary, may revise standards approved under this subsection.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:840 --><p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Certification of Compliance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may require a sponsor to certify that the sponsor will comply with this subchapter in carrying out the project.

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Preventive Maintenance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After January 1, 1995, the Secretary may approve an application under this subchapter for the replacement or reconstruction of pavement at an airport only if the sponsor has provided such assurances or certifications as the Secretary may determine appropriate that such airport has implemented an effective airport pavement maintenance-management program. The Secretary may require such reports on pavement condition and pavement management programs as the Secretary determines may be useful.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Notification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The sponsor of an airport for which an amount is apportioned under section 47114(c) of this title shall notify the Secretary of the fiscal year in which the sponsor intends to submit a project grant application for the apportioned amount.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in section 47111 of this title, the United States Government may pay or be obligated to pay, from amounts appropriated to carry out this subchapter, a cost incurred in carrying out a project under this subchapter only if the Secretary of Transportation decides the cost is allowable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Allowable Cost Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A project cost is allowable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if the cost necessarily is incurred in carrying out the project in compliance with the grant agreement made for the project under this subchapter, including any cost a sponsor incurs related to an audit the Secretary requires under section 47121(b) or (d) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) if the cost is incurred after the grant agreement is executed and is for airport development or airport planning carried out after the grant agreement is executed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the cost is incurred after June 1, 1989, by the airport operator (regardless of when the grant agreement is executed) as part of a Government-approved noise compatability program (including project formulation costs) and is consistent with all applicable statutory and administrative requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) if the Government's share is paid only with amounts apportioned under paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 47114(c) of this title and if the cost is incurred&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) after September 30, 1996;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) before a grant agreement is executed for the project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) in accordance with an airport layout plan approved by the Secretary and with all statutory and administrative requirements that would have been applicable to the project if the project had been carried out after the grant agreement had been executed; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) if the cost is incurred after September 11, 2001, for a project described in section 47102(3)(J), 47102(3)(K), or 47102(3)(L) and shall not depend upon the date of execution of a grant agreement made under this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to the extent the cost is reasonable in amount;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) if the cost is not incurred in a project for airport development or airport planning for which other Government assistance has been granted; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) if the total costs allowed for the project are not more than the amount stated in the grant agreement as the maximum the Government will pay (except as provided in section 47108(b) of this title).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Certain Prior Costs as Allowable Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may decide that a project cost under subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section incurred after May 13, 1946, and before the date the grant agreement is executed is allowable if it is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) necessarily incurred in formulating an airport development project, including costs <!-- PDFPage:856 -->incurred for field surveys, plans and specifications, property interests in land or airspace, and administration or other incidental items that would not have been incurred except for the project; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) necessarily and directly incurred in developing the work scope of an airport planning project.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Terminal Development Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may decide that the cost of terminal development (including multi-modal terminal development) in a nonrevenue-producing public-use area of a commercial service airport is allowable for an airport development project at the airport&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if the sponsor certifies that the airport, on the date the grant application is submitted to the Secretary, has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) all the safety equipment required for certification of the airport under section 44706 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) all the security equipment required by regulation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) provided for access, to the area of the airport for passengers for boarding or exiting aircraft, to those passengers boarding or exiting aircraft, except air carrier aircraft;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the cost is directly related to moving passengers and baggage in air commerce within the airport, including vehicles for moving passengers between terminal facilities and between terminal facilities and aircraft; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) under terms necessary to protect the interests of the Government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In making a decision under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary may approve as allowable costs the expenses of terminal development in a revenue-producing area and construction, reconstruction, repair, and improvement in a nonrevenue-producing parking lot if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the airport does not have more than .05 percent of the total annual passenger boardings in the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the sponsor certifies that any needed airport development project affecting safety, security, or capacity will not be deferred because of the Secretary's approval.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Letters of Intent</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may issue a letter of intent to the sponsor stating an intention to obligate from future budget authority an amount, not more than the Government's share of allowable project costs, for an airport development project (including costs of formulating the project) at a primary or reliever airport. The letter shall establish a schedule under which the Secretary will reimburse the sponsor for the Government's share of allowable project costs, as amounts become available, if the sponsor, after the Secretary issues the letter, carries out the project without receiving amounts under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection applies to a project&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) about which the sponsor notifies the Secretary, before the project begins, of the sponsor's intent to carry out the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that will comply with all statutory and administrative requirements that would apply to the project if it were carried out with amounts made available under this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that meets the criteria of section 47115(d) and, if for a project at a commercial service airport having at least 0.25 percent of the boardings each year at all such airports, the Secretary decides will enhance system-wide airport capacity significantly.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A letter of intent issued under paragraph (1) of this subsection is not an obligation of the Government under section 1501 of title 31, and the letter is not deemed to be an administrative commitment for financing. An obligation or administrative commitment may be made only as amounts are provided in authorization and appropriation laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The total estimated amount of future Government obligations covered by all outstanding letters of intent under paragraph (1) of this subsection may not be more than the amount authorized to carry out section 48103 of this title, less an amount reasonably estimated by the Secretary to be needed for grants under section 48103 that are not covered by a letter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <cap-smallcap>Letters of intent</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not require an eligible agency to impose a passenger facility fee under section 40117 in order to obtain a letter of intent under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on statutory construction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the obligation of amounts pursuant to a letter of intent under this subsection in the same fiscal year as the letter of intent is issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Nonallowable Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section and section 47118(f) of this title, a cost is not an allowable airport development project cost if it is for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) constructing a public parking facility for passenger automobiles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) constructing, altering, or repairing part of an airport building, except to the extent the building will be used for facilities or activities directly related to the safety of individuals at the airport;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) providing or installing sculpture or art works.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;47111. Payments under project grant agreements</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After making a project grant agreement under this subchapter and consulting with the sponsor, the Secretary of Transportation may decide when and in what amounts payments under the agreement will be made. Payments totaling not more than 90 percent of the United States Government's share of the project's estimated allowable costs may be made before the project is completed if the sponsor certifies to the Secretary that the total amount expended from the advance payments at any time will not be more than the cost of the airport development work completed on the project at that time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Recovering Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary determines that the total amount of payments made under a grant agreement under this subchapter is more than the Government's share of the total allowable project costs, the Government may recover the excess amount. If the Secretary finds that a project for which an advance payment was made has not been completed within a reasonable time, the Government may recover any part of the advance payment for which the Government received no benefit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Payment Deposits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A payment under a project grant agreement under this subchapter may be made only to an official or depository designated by the sponsor and authorized by law to receive public money.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Withholding Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may withhold a payment under a grant agreement under this subchapter for more than 180 days after the payment is due only if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notifies the sponsor and provides an opportunity for a hearing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) finds that the sponsor has violated the agreement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The 180-day period may be extended by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) agreement of the Secretary and the sponsor; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the hearing officer if the officer decides an extension is necessary because the sponsor did not follow the schedule the officer established.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A person adversely affected by an order of the Secretary withholding a payment may apply for review of the order by filing a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the project is located. The petition must be filed not later than 60 days after the order is served on the petitioner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Action on Grant Assurances Concerning Airport Revenues</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary finds a violation of section 47107(b) of this title, as further defined by the Secretary under section 47107(<em>l</em>) of this title, or a violation of an assurance made under section 47107(b) of this title, and the Secretary has provided an opportunity for the airport sponsor to take corrective action to cure such violation, and such corrective action has not been taken within the period of time set by the Secretary, the Secretary shall withhold approval of any new grant application for funds under this chapter, or any proposed modification to an existing grant that would increase the amount of funds made available under this chapter to the airport sponsor, and withhold approval of any new application to impose a fee under section 40117 of this title. Such applications may thereafter be approved only upon a finding by the Secretary that such corrective action as the Secretary requires has been taken to address the violation and that the violation no longer exists.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:859 --><p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Judicial Enforcement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For any violation of this chapter or any grant assurance made under this chapter, the Secretary may apply to the district court of the United States for any district in which the violation occurred for enforcement. Such court shall have jurisdiction to enforce obedience thereto by a writ of injunction or other process, mandatory or otherwise, restraining any person from further violation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Primary airports.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) $2.60 for each of the next 400,000 passenger boardings at the airport during the prior calendar year;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:861 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) $.65 for each of the next 500,000 passenger boardings at the airport during the prior calendar year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) $.50 for each additional passenger boarding at the airport during the prior calendar year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Minimum and maximum apportionments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not less than $650,000 nor more than $22,000,000 may be apportioned under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph to an airport sponsor for a primary airport for each fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Special rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any fiscal year in which the total amount made available under section 48103 is $3,200,000,000 or more&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount to be apportioned to a sponsor under subparagraph (A) shall be increased by doubling the amount that would otherwise be apportioned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the minimum apportionment to a sponsor under subparagraph (B) shall be $1,000,000 rather than $650,000; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) <cap-smallcap>Use of previous fiscal year's apportionment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Secretary may apportion to an airport sponsor in a fiscal year an amount equal to the amount apportioned to that sponsor in the previous fiscal year if the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) passenger boardings at the airport fell below 10,000 in the calendar year used to calculate the apportionment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the airport had at least 10,000 passenger boardings in the calendar year prior to the calendar year used to calculate apportionments to airport sponsors in a fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the cause of the shortfall in passenger boardings was a temporary but significant interruption in service by an air carrier to that airport due to an employment action, natural disaster, or other event unrelated to the demand for air transportation at the affected airport.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <cap-smallcap>Cargo only airports.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Suballocation formula</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any funds apportioned under subparagraph (A) to sponsors of airports described in subparagraph (A) shall be allocated among those airports in the proportion that the total annual landed weight of aircraft described in subparagraph (A) landing at each of those airports bears to the total annual landed weight of those aircraft landing at all those airports.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Limitation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any fiscal year in which the total amount made available under section 48103 is less than $3,200,000,000, not more than 8 percent of the amount apportioned under subparagraph (A) may be apportioned for any one airport.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Distribution to other airports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before apportioning amounts to the sponsors of airports under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year, the Secretary may set-aside a portion of such amounts for distribution to the sponsors of other airports, selected by the Secretary, that the Secretary finds will be served primarily by aircraft providing air transportation of only cargo.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) <cap-smallcap>Determination of landed weight</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Landed weight under this paragraph is the landed weight of aircraft landing at each airport described in subparagraph (A) during the prior calendar year.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Existence and Amounts in Fund</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation has a discretionary fund. The fund consists of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) amounts subject to apportionment for a fiscal year that are not apportioned under section 47114(c)&ndash;(e) of this title; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:865 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 12.5 percent of amounts not apportioned under section 47114 of this title because of section 47114(f).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Availability of Amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to subsection (c) of this section and section 47117(e) of this title, the fund is available for making grants for any purpose for which amounts are made available under section 48103 of this title that the Secretary considers most appropriate to carry out this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Minimum Percentage for Primary and Reliever Airports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At least 75 percent of the amount in the fund and distributed by the Secretary in a fiscal year shall be used for making grants&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to preserve and enhance capacity, safety, and security at primary and reliever airports; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to carry out airport noise compatibility planning and programs at primary and reliever airports.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In selecting a project for a grant to preserve and enhance capacity as described in subsection (c)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the effect the project will have on the overall national air transportation system capacity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the project benefit and cost, including, in the case of a project at a reliever airport, the number of operations projected to be diverted from a primary airport to the reliever airport as a result of the project, as well as the cost savings projected to be realized by users of the local airport system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the financial commitment from non-United States Government sources to preserve or enhance airport capacity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the airport improvement priorities of the States, and regional offices of the Administration, to the extent such priorities are not in conflict with paragraphs (1) and (2);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the projected growth in the number of passengers that will be using the airport at which the project will be carried out; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) any increase in the number of passenger boardings in the preceding 12-month period at the airport at which the project will be carried out, with priority consideration to be given to projects at airports at which the number of passenger boardings increased by at least 20 percent as compared to the number of passenger boardings in the 12-month period preceding such period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Waiving Percentage Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary decides the Secretary cannot comply with the percentage requirement of subsection (c) of this section in a fiscal year because there are insufficient qualified grant applications to meet that percentage, the amount the Secretary determines will not be distributed as required by subsection (c) is available for obligation during the fiscal year without regard to the requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Consideration of Diversion of Revenues in Awarding Discretionary Grants.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>General rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to paragraph (2), in deciding whether or not to distribute funds to an airport from the discretionary funds established by subsection (a) of this section and section 47116 of this title, the Secretary shall consider as a factor militating against the distribution of such funds to the airport the fact that the airport is using revenues generated by the airport or by local taxes on aviation fuel for purposes other than capital or operating costs of the airport or the local airports system or other local facilities which are owned or operated by the owner or operator of the airport and directly and substantially related to the actual air transportation of passengers or property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Required finding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Paragraph (1) shall apply only when the Secretary finds that the amount of revenues used by the airport for purposes other than capital or operating costs in the airport's fiscal year preceding the date of the application for discretionary funds exceeds the amount of such revenues in the airport's first fiscal year ending after August 23, 1994, adjusted by the Secretary for changes in the Consumer Price Index of All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Minimum Amount To Be Credited.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary decides that an amount required to be used for grants under paragraph (1) of this subsection cannot be used for a fiscal year because there are insufficient qualified grant applications, the amount the Secretary determines cannot be used is available during the fiscal year for grants for other airports or for other purposes for which amounts are authorized for grants under section 48103 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to paragraph (2), if the Secretary finds that all or part of an amount of an apportionment under section 47114 is not required during a fiscal year to fund a grant for which the apportionment may be used, the Secretary may use during such fiscal year the amount not so required to make grants for any purpose for which grants may be made under section 48103. The finding may be based on the notifications that the Secretary receives under section 47105(f) or on other information received from airport sponsors.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the fiscal year for which a finding is made under paragraph (1) with respect to an apportionment is not the last fiscal year of availability of the apportionment under subsection (b), the Secretary shall restore to the apportionment an amount equal to the amount of the apportionment used under paragraph (1) for a discretionary grant whenever a sufficient amount is made available under section 48103.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Period of availability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If restoration under this paragraph is made in the fis<!-- PDFPage:869 -->cal year for which the finding is made or the succeeding fiscal year, the amount restored shall be subject to the original period of availability of the apportionment under subsection (b).

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Use of remaining amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subparagraph (A) does not impair the Secretary's authority under paragraph (1), after a restoration under paragraph (2), to apply all or part of a restored amount that is not required to fund a grant under an apportionment to fund discretionary grants.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Limitations on obligations apply</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the Secretary to incur grant obligations under section 47104 for a fiscal year in an amount greater than the amount made available under section 48103 for such obligations for such fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Limiting Authority of Secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority of the Secretary to make grants during a fiscal year from amounts that were apportioned for a prior fiscal year and remain available for approved airport development project grants under subsection (b) of this section may be impaired only by a law enacted after September 3, 1982, that expressly limits that authority.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall consider only current or former military airports for designation under this section if a grant under section 47117(e)(1)(B) would&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Parking Lots, Fuel Farms, Utilities, Hangars, and Air Cargo Terminals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not more than a total of $7,000,000 for each airport from amounts the Secretary distributes under section 47115 of this title for fiscal years beginning after September 30, 1992, is available to the sponsor of a current or former military airport the Secretary designates under this section to construct, improve, or repair airport surface parking lots, fuel farms, utilities, and hangars and air cargo terminals of an area that is 50,000 square feet or less.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Government Relief From Liability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall ensure that an agreement under this subchapter with a State or a political subdivision of a State to allow the State or subdivision to operate an airport facility in the State or subdivision relieves the United States Government from any liability arising out of, or related to, acts or omissions of employees of the State or subdivision in operating the airport facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Air Traffic Control Contract Program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall continue the low activity (Visual Flight Rules) level I air traffic control tower contract program established under subsection (a) of this section for towers existing on December 30, 1987, and extend the program to other towers as practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may make a contract, on a sole source basis, with a State or a political subdivision of a State to allow the State or subdivision to operate an airport traffic control tower classified as a level I (Visual Flight Rules) tower if the Secretary decides that the State or subdivision has the capability to comply with the <!-- PDFPage:876 -->requirements of this paragraph. The contract shall require that the State or subdivision comply with applicable safety regulations in operating the facility and with applicable competition requirements in making a subcontract to perform work to carry out the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Contract air traffic control tower pilot program.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall establish a pilot program to contract for air traffic control services at Level I air traffic control towers, as defined by the Secretary, that do not qualify for the contract tower program established under subsection (a) and continued under paragraph (1) (in this paragraph referred to as the &ldquo;Contract Tower Program&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Program components</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out the pilot program, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) utilize for purposes of cost-benefit analyses, current, actual, site-specific data, forecast estimates, or airport master plan data provided by a facility owner or operator and verified by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) approve for participation only facilities willing to fund a pro rata share of the operating costs of the air traffic control tower to achieve a 1-to-1 benefit-to-cost ratio using actual site-specific contract tower operating costs in any case in which there is an operating air traffic control tower, as required for eligibility under the Contract Tower Program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Priority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In selecting facilities to participate in the pilot program, the Secretary shall give priority to the following facilities:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Air traffic control towers that are participating in the Contract Tower Program but have been notified that they will be terminated from such program because the Secretary has determined that the benefit-to-cost ratio for their continuation in such program is less than 1.0.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) Air traffic control towers that the Secretary determines have a benefit-to-cost ratio of at least .50.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) Air traffic control towers of the Federal Aviation Administration that are closed as a result of the air traffic controllers strike in 1981.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) Air traffic control towers located at airports or points at which an air carrier is receiving compensation under the essential air service program under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) Air traffic control towers located at airports that are prepared to assume partial responsibility for maintenance costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) Air traffic control towers located at airports with safety or operational problems related to topography, weather, runway configuration, or mix of aircraft.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vii) Air traffic control towers located at an airport at which the community has been operating the tower at its own expense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Costs exceeding benefits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the costs of operating an air traffic tower under the pilot program exceed the benefits, the airport sponsor or State or local government having jurisdiction over the airport shall pay the portion of the costs that exceed such benefit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) <cap-smallcap>Funding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to paragraph (4)(D), of the amounts appropriated pursuant to section 106(k), not more than $6,000,000 per fiscal year may be used to carry out this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <cap-smallcap>Construction of air traffic control towers.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Secretary may provide grants under this subchapter to not more than two airport sponsors for the construction of a low-level activity visual flight rule (level 1) air traffic control tower, as defined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Eligibility</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A sponsor shall be eligible for a grant under this paragraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the sponsor would otherwise be eligible to participate in the pilot program established under paragraph (3) except for the lack of the air traffic control tower proposed to be constructed under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the sponsor agrees to fund not less than 25 percent of the costs of construction of the air traffic control tower.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Request Secretary's Determination.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall issue a determination as to whether a fee imposed upon one or more air carriers (as defined in section 40102 of this title) by the owner or operator of an airport is reasonable if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a written request for such determination is filed with the Secretary by such owner or operator; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a written complaint requesting such determination is filed with the Secretary by an affected air carrier within 60 days after such carrier receives written notice of the establishment or increase of such fee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Calculation of fee</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A fee subject to a determination of reasonableness under this section may be calculated pursuant to either a compensatory or residual fee methodology or any combination thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Secretary not to set fee</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining whether a fee is reasonable under this section, the Secretary may only determine whether the fee is reasonable or unreasonable and shall not set the level of the fee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Fees imposed by privately-owned airports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In evaluating the reasonableness of a fee imposed by an airport receiving an exemption under section 47134 of this title, the Secretary shall consider whether the airport has complied with section 47134(c)(4).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Procedural Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 90 days after August 23, 1994, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register final regulations, policy statements, or guidelines establishing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the procedures for acting upon any written request or complaint filed under subsection (a)(1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the standards or guidelines that shall be used by the Secretary in determining under this section whether an airport fee is reasonable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Decisions By Secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The final regulations, policy statements, or guidelines required in subsection (b) shall provide the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Not more than 120 days after an air carrier files with the Secretary a written complaint relating to an airport fee, the Secretary shall issue a final order determining whether such fee is reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Within 30 days after such complaint is filed with the Secretary, the Secretary shall dismiss the complaint if no significant dispute exists or shall assign the matter to an administrative law judge; and thereafter the matter shall be handled in accordance with part 302 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, or as modified by the Secretary to ensure an orderly disposition of the matter within the 120-day period and any specifically applicable provisions of this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:880 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The administrative law judge shall issue a recommended decision within 60 days after the complaint is assigned or within such shorter period as the Secretary may specify.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If the Secretary, upon the expiration of 120 days after the filing of the complaint, has not issued a final order, the decision of the administrative law judge shall be deemed to be the final order of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Any party to the dispute may seek review of a final order of the Secretary under this subsection in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or the court of appeals in the circuit where the airport which gives rise to the written complaint is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Any findings of fact in a final order of the Secretary under this subsection, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive if challenged in a court pursuant to this subsection. No objection to such a final order shall be considered by the court unless objection was urged before an administrative law judge or the Secretary at a proceeding under this subsection or, if not so urged, unless there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Payment Under Protest; Guarantee of Air Carrier Access.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Payment under protest.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any fee increase or newly established fee which is the subject of a complaint that is not dismissed by the Secretary shall be paid by the complainant air carrier to the airport under protest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Referral or credit</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any amounts paid under this subsection by a complainant air carrier to the airport under protest shall be subject to refund or credit to the air carrier in accordance with directions in the final order of the Secretary within 30 days of such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Assurance of timely repayment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In order to assure the timely repayment, with interest, of amounts in dispute determined not to be reasonable by the Secretary, the airport shall obtain a letter of credit, or surety bond, or other suitable credit facility, equal to the amount in dispute that is due during the 120-day period established by this section, plus interest, unless the airport and the complainant air carrier agree otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Deadline</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The letter of credit, or surety bond, or other suitable credit facility shall be provided to the Secretary within 20 days of the filing of the complaint and shall remain in effect for 30 days after the earlier of 120 days or the issuance of a timely final order by the Secretary determining whether such fee is reasonable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Guarantee of air carrier access</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Contingent upon an air carrier's compliance with the requirements of paragraph (1) and pending the issuance of a final order by the Secretary determining the reasonableness of a fee that is the subject of a complaint filed under subsection (a)(1)(B), an owner or operator of an airport may not deny an air carrier currently providing air service at the airport reasonable access to airport facilities or service, or otherwise interfere with an air carrier's prices, routes, or services, as a means of enforcing the fee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Applicability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section does not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a fee imposed pursuant to a written agreement with air carriers using the facilities of an airport;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) aviation noise management is crucial to the continued increase in airport capacity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) community noise concerns have led to uncoordinated and inconsistent restrictions on aviation that could impede the national air transportation system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a noise policy must be carried out at the national level;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) local interest in aviation noise management shall be considered in determining the national interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) community concerns can be alleviated through the use of new technology aircraft and the use of revenues, including those available from passenger facility fees, for noise management;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) revenues controlled by the United States Government can help resolve noise problems and carry with them a responsibility to the national airport system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) revenues derived from a passenger facility fee may be applied to noise management and increased airport capacity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) a precondition to the establishment and collection of a passenger facility fee is the prescribing by the Secretary of Transportation of a regulation establishing procedures for reviewing airport noise and access restrictions on operations of stage 2 and stage 3 aircraft.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) An air carrier that provided turnaround service in Hawaii on November 5, 1990, using stage 2 aircraft with a maximum weight of more than 75,000 pounds may include in the number of aircraft authorized under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph all stage 2 aircraft with a maximum weight of more than 75,000 pounds that were owned or leased by that carrier on that date, whether or not the aircraft were operated by the carrier on that date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An air carrier may provide turnaround service in Hawaii using stage 2 aircraft with a maximum weight of more than 75,000 pounds only if the carrier provided the service on November 5, 1990.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An air carrier operating stage 2 aircraft under this subsection may transport stage 2 aircraft to or from the 48 contiguous States on a nonrevenue basis in order&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the 2 federally owned airports in the metropolitan area of the District of Columbia constitute an important and growing part of the commerce, transportation, and economic patterns of Virginia, the District of Columbia, and the surrounding region;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Baltimore/Washington International Airport, owned and operated by Maryland, is an air transportation facility that provides service to the greater Metropolitan Washington region together with the 2 federally owned airports, and timely Federal-aid grants to Baltimore/Washington International Airport will provide additional capacity to meet the growing air traffic needs and to compete with other airports on a fair basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the United States Government has a continuing but limited interest in the operation of the 2 federally owned airports, which serve the travel and cargo needs of the entire Metropolitan Washington region as well as the District of Columbia as the national seat of government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) operation of the Metropolitan Washington Airports by an independent local authority will facilitate timely improvements at both airports to meet the growing demand of <!-- PDFPage:913 -->interstate air transportation occasioned by the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95&ndash;504; 92 Stat. 1705);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) all other major air carrier airports in the United States are operated by public entities at the State, regional, or local level;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) any change in status of the 2 airports must take into account the interest of nearby communities, the traveling public, air carriers, general aviation, airport employees, and other interested groups, as well as the interests of the United States Government and State governments involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) in recognition of a perceived limited need for a Federal role in the management of these airports and the growing local interest, the Secretary of Transportation has recommended a transfer of authority from the Federal to the local/State level that is consistent with the management of major airports elsewhere in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) an operating authority with representation from local jurisdictions, similar to authorities at all major airports in the United States, will improve communications with local officials and concerned residents regarding noise at the Metropolitan Washington Airports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) a commission of congressional, State, and local officials and aviation representatives has recommended to the Secretary that transfer of the federally owned airports be as a unit to an independent authority to be created by Virginia and the District of Columbia; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the Federal interest in these airports can be provided through a lease mechanism which provides for local control and operation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) retake possession of the property if the Airports Authority fails to have that part of the property be used for airport purposes within a reasonable period of time, as the Secretary decides.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Airports Authority is subject to section 47107(a)&ndash;(c) and (e) of this title and to the assurances and conditions required of grant recipients under the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (Public Law 97&ndash;248; 96 Stat. 671) as in effect on June 7, 1987.
