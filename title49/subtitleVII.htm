<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Sovereignty and Public Right of Transit</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The United States Government has exclusive sovereignty of airspace of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A citizen of the United States has a public right of transit through the navigable airspace. To further that right, the Secretary of Transportation shall consult with the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board established under section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 792) before prescribing a regulation or issuing an order or procedure that will have a significant impact on the accessibility of commercial airports or commercial air transportation for handicapped individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Use of Airspace</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall develop plans and policy for the use of the navigable airspace and assign by regulation or order the use of the airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace. The Administrator may modify or revoke an assignment when required in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator shall prescribe air traffic regulations on the flight of aircraft (including regulations on safe altitudes) for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) navigating, protecting, and identifying aircraft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) protecting individuals and property on the ground;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) using the navigable airspace efficiently; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) preventing collision between aircraft, between aircraft and land or water vehicles, and between aircraft and airborne objects.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) To establish security provisions that will encourage and allow maximum use of the navigable airspace by civil aircraft consistent with national security, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) establish areas in the airspace the Administrator decides are necessary in the interest of national defense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) by regulation or order, restrict or prohibit flight of civil aircraft that the Administrator cannot identify, locate, and control with available facilities in those areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding the military exception in section 553(a)(1) of title 5, subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5 applies to a regulation prescribed under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Foreign Aircraft</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A foreign aircraft, not part of the armed forces of a foreign country, may be navigated in the United States as provided in section 41703 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Aircraft of Armed Forces of Foreign Countries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Aircraft of the armed forces of a foreign country may be navigated in the United States only when authorized by the Secretary of State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>No Exclusive Rights at Certain Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person does not have an exclusive right to use an air navigation facility on which Government money has been expended. However, providing services at an airport by only one fixed-based operator is not an exclusive right if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is unreasonably costly, burdensome, or impractical for more than one fixed-based operator to provide the services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) allowing more than one fixed-based operator to provide the services requires a reduction in space leased under an agreement existing on September 3, 1982, between the operator and the airport.</p>

<p class="note-body">(2) For the purpose of this convention the expression &ldquo;international transportation&rdquo; shall mean any transportation in which, according to the contract made by the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the transportation or a transshipment, are situated either within the territories of two High Contracting Parties, or within the territory of a single High Contracting Party, if there is an agreed stopping place within a territory subject to the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate or authority of another power, even though that power is not a party to this convention. Transportation without such an agreed stopping place between territories subject to the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate, or authority of the same High Contracting Party shall not be deemed to be international for the purposes of this convention.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Transportation to be performed by several successive air carriers shall be deemed, for the purposes of this convention, to be one undivided transportation, if it has been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it has been agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it shall not lose its international character merely because one contract or series of contracts is to be performed entirely within a territory subject to the sovereignty, suzerainty, mandate, or authority of the same High Contracting Party.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Order of Civil Aeronautics Board Approving Increases in Liability Limitations of Warsaw Convention and Hague Protocol</h4>
<p class="note-body">Adopted by the Civil Aeronautics Board at its office in Washington, D.C., on the 13th day of May 1966.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Transportation by Air, generally known as the Warsaw Convention, creates a uniform body of law with respect to the rights and responsibilities of passengers, shippers, and air carriers in international air transportation. The United States became a party to the Convention in 1934, and eventually over 90 countries likewise became parties to the Convention.<sup><a href="#40105_1_target" name="40105_1">1</a></sup> On November 15, 1965, the U.S. Government gave notice of denunciation of the Convention, emphasizing that such action was solely because of the Convention's low limits of liability for personal injury or death to passengers. Pursuant to Article 39 of the Con<!-- PDFPage:520 -->vention this notice would become effective upon 6 months&rsquo; notice, in this case, May 15, 1966. Subsequently, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) made efforts to effect an arrangement among air carriers, foreign air carriers, and other carriers (including carriers not members of IATA) providing the major portions of international air carriage to and from the United States to increase the limitations of liability now applicable to claims for personal injury and death under the Convention and the Protocol. The purpose of such action is to provide a basis upon which the United States could withdrawn its notice of denunciation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The arrangement proposed has been embodied in an agreement (Agreement CAB 18900) between various air carriers, foreign air carriers, and other carriers which has been filed with the Board pursuant to section 412(a) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and Part 261 of the Board's economic regulations and assigned the abovedesignated CAB number.</p>
<p class="note-body">By this agreement, the parties thereto bind themselves to include in their tariffs, effective May 16, 1966, a special contract in accordance with Article 22(1) of the Convention or the Protocol providing for a limit of liability for each passenger for death, wounding, or other bodily injury of $75,000 inclusive of legal fees, and, in case of a claim brought in a State where provision is made for separate award of legal fees and costs, a limit of $58,000 exclusive of legal fees and costs. These limitations shall be applicable to international transportation by the carrier as defined in the Convention or Protocol which includes a point in the United States as a point of origin, point of destination, or agreed stopping place. The parties further agree to provide in their tariffs that the Carrier shall not, with respect to any claim arising out of the death, wounding, or other bodily injury of a passenger, avail itself of any defense under Article 20(1) of the Convention or the Convention as amended by the Protocol. The tariff provisions would stipulate, however, that nothing therein shall be deemed to affect the rights and liabilities of the Carrier with regard to any claim brought by, on behalf of, or in respect of any person who has willfully caused damage which results in death, wounding, or other bodily injury of a passenger.</p>
<p class="note-body">The carriers by the agreement further stipulate that they will, at time of delivery of the tickets, furnish to each passenger governed by the Convention or the Protocol and by the special contract described above, a notice in 10 point type advising international passengers of the limitations of liability established by the Convention or the Protocol, or the higher liability agreed to by the special contracts pursuant to the Convention or Protocol as described above. The agreement is to become effective upon arrival by this Board, and any carrier may become a party to it by signing a counterpart thereof and depositing it with the Board. Withdrawal from the agreement may be effected by giving 12 months&rsquo; written notice to the Board and the other Carrier parties thereto.</p>
<p class="note-body">As indicated, the decision of the U.S. Government to serve notice to denounce the Convention was predicated upon the low liability limits therein for personal injury and death. The Government announced, however, that it would be prepared to withdraw the Notice of Denunciation if, prior to its effective date, there is a reasonable prospect for international agreement on limits of liability for international transportation in the area of $100,000 per passenger or on uniform rules without any limit of liability, and if pending such international agreement there is a provisional arrangement among the principal international air carriers providing for liability up to $75,000 per passenger.</p>
<p class="note-body">Steps, have been taken by the signing carriers to have tariffs become effective May 16, 1966, upon approval of this agreement, which will increase by special contract their liability for personal injury or death as described herein. The signatory carriers provide by far the greater portion of international transportation to, from, and within the United States. The agreement will result in a salutory increase in the protection given to passengers from the increased liability amounts and the waiver of defenses under Article 20(1) of the Convention or Protocol. The U.S. Government has concluded that such arrangements warrant withdrawal of the Notice of Denunciation of the Warsaw Convention. Implementation of the agreement will permit continued adherence to the Convention with the benefits to be derived therefrom, but without the imposition of the low liability limits therein contained upon most international travel involving travel to or from the United States. The stipulation that no tariff provision shall be deemed to affect the rights and liabilities of the carrier with regard to any claim brought by, on behalf of, or in respect of any person who has willfully caused damage which results in death, wounding or other bodily injury of a passenger operates to diminish any incentive for sabotage.</p>
<p class="note-body">Upon consideration of the agreement, and of matters relating thereto of which the Board takes notice, the Board does not find that the agreement is adverse to the public interest or in violation of the Act and it will be approved.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, and particularly sections 102, 204(a), and 412 thereof:</p>
<p class="note-body"><em>It is ordered</em>, That: 1. Agreement CAB 18900 is approved.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Air Carriers and Foreign Air Carriers Not Engaged Directly in Operating Aircraft</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may exempt from subpart II of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an air carrier not engaged directly in operating aircraft in air transportation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a foreign air carrier not engaged directly in operating aircraft in foreign air transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The exemption is effective to the extent and for periods that the Secretary decides are in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Safety Regulation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may grant an exemption from a regulation prescribed in carrying out sections 40103(b)(1) and (2), 40119, <!-- PDFPage:524 -->44901, 44903, 44906, and 44935&ndash;44937 of this title when the Administrator decides the exemption is in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Other Economic Regulation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in this section, the Secretary may exempt to the extent the Secretary considers necessary a person or class of persons from a provision of chapter 411, chapter 413 (except sections 41307 and 41310(b)&ndash;(f)), chapter 415 (except sections 41502, 41505, and 41507&ndash;41509), chapter 417 (except sections 41703, 41704, 41710, 41713, and 41714), chapter 419, subchapter II of chapter 421, and sections 44909 and 46301(b) of this title, or a regulation or term prescribed under any of those provisions, when the Secretary decides that the exemption is consistent with the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Labor Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not exempt an air carrier from section 42112 of this title. However, the Secretary may exempt from section 42112(b)(1) and (2) an air carrier not providing scheduled air transportation, and the operations conducted during daylight hours by an air carrier providing scheduled air transportation, when the Secretary decides that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) because of the limited extent of, or unusual circumstances affecting, the operation of the air carrier, the enforcement of section 42112(b)(1) and (2) of this title is or would be an unreasonable burden on the air carrier that would obstruct its development and prevent it from beginning or continuing operations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the exemption would not affect adversely the public interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Flying Hours</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not exempt an air carrier under this section from a provision referred to in subsection (c) of this section, or a regulation or term prescribed under any of those provisions, that sets maximum flying hours for pilots or copilots.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Smaller Aircraft</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An air carrier is exempt from section 41101(a)(1) of this title, and the Secretary may exempt an air carrier from another provision of subpart II of this part, if the air carrier&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) provides passenger transportation only with aircraft having a maximum capacity of 55 passengers; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) provides the transportation of cargo only with aircraft having a maximum payload of less than 18,000 pounds; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) complies with liability insurance requirements and other regulations the Secretary prescribes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may increase the passenger or payload capacities when the public interest requires.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) An exemption under this subsection applies to an air carrier providing air transportation between 2 places in Alaska, or between Alaska and Canada, only if the carrier is authorized by Alaska to provide the transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may limit the number or location of places that may be served by an air carrier providing transportation only in Alaska under an exemption from section 41101(a)(1) of this title, or the frequency with which the transportation may be provided, only when the Secretary decides that providing the transportation substantially impairs the ability of an air carrier holding a certificate issued by the Secretary to provide its authorized transportation, including the minimum transportation requirement for Alaska specified under section 41732(b)(1)(B) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Emergency Air Transportation by Foreign Air Carriers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To the extent that the Secretary decides an exemption is in the public interest, the Secretary may exempt by order a foreign air carrier from the requirements and limitations of this part for not more than 30 days to allow the foreign air carrier to carry passengers or cargo in interstate air transportation in certain markets if the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) because of an emergency created by unusual circumstances not arising in the normal course of business, air carriers holding certificates under section 41102 of this title cannot accommodate traffic in those markets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) all possible efforts have been made to accommodate the traffic by using the resources of the air carriers, including the use of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) foreign aircraft, or sections of foreign aircraft, under lease or charter to the air carriers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the air carriers&rsquo; reservations systems to the extent practicable;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the exemption is necessary to avoid unreasonable hardship for the traffic in the markets that cannot be accommodated by the air carriers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) granting the exemption will not result in an unreasonable advantage to any party in a labor dispute where the inability to accommodate traffic in a market is a result of the dispute.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Secretary grants an exemption to a foreign air carrier under this subsection, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ensure that air transportation that the foreign air carrier provides under the exemption is made available on reasonable terms;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) monitor continuously the passenger load factor of air carriers in the market that hold certificates under section 41102 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) review the exemption at least every 30 days to ensure that the unusual circumstances that established the need for the exemption still exist.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may renew an exemption (including renewals) under this subsection for not more than 30 days. An exemption may continue for not more than 5 days after the unusual circumstances that established the need for the exemption cease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Notice and Opportunity for Hearing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may act under subsections (d) and (f)(3)(B) of this section only after giving the air carrier notice and an opportunity for a hearing.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When making a contract under this section, the Administrator shall be guided by the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The part of the cost of a plant or equipment amortized as a cost of contract performance may not be more than the ratio between the period of contract performance and the anticipated useful commercial life (instead of physical life) of the plant or equipment, considering the location and specialized nature of the plant or equipment, obsolescence, and other similar factors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Administrator shall consider the desirability of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) obtaining an option to renew the contract for a reasonable period of not more than 3 years, at a price that does not include charges for nonrecurring costs already amortized; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reserving in the Administrator the right, on payment of the unamortized part of the cost of the plant or equipment, to take title to the plant or equipment under appropriate circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Ending Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contract made under this section shall be ended if amounts are not made available to continue the contract into a subsequent fiscal year. The cost of ending the contract may be paid from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an appropriation originally available for carrying out the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an appropriation currently available for procuring the type of service concerned and not otherwise obligated; or</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding section 1341(a)(1)(B) of title 31 and to the extent that amounts otherwise are available for obligation, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may make a contract of more than one but not more than 5 fiscal years to purchase property, except a contract to construct, alter, or make a major repair or improvement to real property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Required Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may make a contract under this section if the Administrator finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the contract will promote the safety or efficiency of the national airspace system and will result in reduced total contract costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the minimum need for the property to be purchased is expected to remain substantially unchanged during the proposed contract period in terms of production rate, procurement rate, and total quantities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) there is a reasonable expectation that throughout the proposed contract period the Administrator will request appropriations for the contract at the level required to avoid cancellation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) there is a stable design for the property to be acquired and the technical risks associated with the property are not excessive; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the estimates of the contract costs and the anticipated savings from the contract are realistic.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall prescribe regulations for acquiring property under this section to promote the use of contracts under this section in a way that will allow the most efficient use of those contracts. The regulations may provide for a cancellation provision in the contract to the extent the provision is necessary and in the best interest of the United States. The provision may include <!-- PDFPage:530 -->consideration of recurring and nonrecurring costs of the contractor associated with producing the item to be delivered under the contract. The regulations shall provide that, to the extent practicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to broaden the aviation industrial base&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a contract under this section shall be used to seek, retain, and promote the use under that contract of subcontractors, vendors, or suppliers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on accrual of a payment or other benefit accruing on a contract under this section to a subcontractor, vendor, or supplier participating in the contract, the payment or benefit shall be delivered in the most expeditious way practicable; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) this section and regulations prescribed under this section may not be carried out in a way that precludes or curtails the existing ability of the Administrator to provide for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) competition in producing items to be delivered under a contract under this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) ending a prime contract when performance is deficient with respect to cost, quality, or schedule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Contract Provisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A contract under this section may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be used for the advance procurement of components, parts, and material necessary to manufacture equipment to be used in the national airspace system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provide that performance under the contract after the first year is subject to amounts being appropriated; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) contain a negotiated priced option for varying the number of end items to be procured over the period of the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If feasible and practicable, an advance procurement contract may be made to achieve economic-lot purchases and more efficient production rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Cancellation Payment and Notice of Cancellation Ceiling</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If a contract under this section provides that performance is subject to an appropriation being made, it also may provide for a cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if the appropriation is not made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before awarding a contract under this section containing a cancellation ceiling of more than $100,000,000, the Administrator shall give written notice of the proposed contract and cancellation ceiling to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives. The contract may not be awarded until the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date of the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Ending Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contract made under this section shall be ended if amounts are not made available to continue the contract into a subsequent fiscal year. The cost of ending the contract may be paid from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an appropriation originally available for carrying out the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an appropriation currently available for procuring the type of property concerned and not otherwise obligated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) amounts appropriated for payments to end the contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:535 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;airport&rdquo;, &ldquo;commercial service airport&rdquo;, and &ldquo;public agency&rdquo; have the same meanings given those terms in section 47102 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;eligible agency&rdquo; means a public agency that controls a commercial service airport.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) &ldquo;eligible airport-related project&rdquo; means a project&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for airport development or airport planning under subchapter I of chapter 471 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for terminal development described in section 47110(d) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) for airport noise capability planning under section 47505 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to carry out noise compatibility measures eligible for assistance under section 47504 of this title, whether or not a program for those measures has been approved under section 47504; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) for constructing gates and related areas at which passengers board or exit aircraft.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) &ldquo;passenger facility fee&rdquo; means a fee imposed under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) &ldquo;passenger facility revenue&rdquo; means revenue derived from a passenger facility fee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may authorize under this section an eligible agency to impose a passenger facility fee of $1, $2, or $3 on each paying passenger of an air carrier or foreign air carrier boarding an aircraft at an airport the agency controls to finance an eligible airport-related project, including making payments for debt service on indebtedness incurred to carry out the project, to be carried out in connection with the airport or any other airport the agency controls.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A State, political subdivision of a State, or authority of a State or political subdivision that is not the eligible agency may not regulate or prohibit the imposition or collection of a passenger facility fee or the use of the passenger facility revenue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A passenger facility fee may be imposed on a passenger of an air carrier or foreign air carrier originating or connecting at the commercial service airport that the agency controls.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Applications</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An eligible agency must submit to the Secretary an application for authority to impose a passenger facility fee. The application shall contain information and be in the form that the Secretary may require by regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before submitting an application, the eligible agency must provide reasonable notice to, and an opportunity for consultation with, air carriers and foreign air carriers operating at the airport. The Secretary shall prescribe regulations that define reasonable notice and contain at least the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The agency must provide written notice of individual projects being considered for financing by a passenger facility fee and the date and location of a meeting to present the projects to air carriers and foreign air carriers operating at the airport.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Not later than 30 days after written notice is provided under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, each air carrier and foreign air carrier operating at the airport must provide to the agency written notice of receipt of the notice. Failure of a carrier to provide the notice may be deemed certification of agreement with the project by the carrier under subparagraph (D) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Not later than 45 days after written notice is provided under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the agency must conduct a meeting to provide air carriers and foreign air carriers with descriptions of projects and justifications and a detailed financial plan for projects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Not later than 30 days after the meeting, each air carrier and foreign air carrier must provide to the agency certification of agreement or disagreement with projects (or total plan for the projects). Failure to provide the certification is deemed certification of agreement with the project by the carrier. A certification of disagreement is void if it does not contain the reasons for the disagreement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) After receiving an application, the Secretary shall provide notice and an opportunity to air carriers, foreign air carriers, and other interested persons to comment on the application. The Secretary shall make a final decision on the application not later than 120 days after receiving it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Limitations on Approving Applications</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may approve an application that an eligible agency has submitted under subsection (c) of this section to finance a specific project only if the Secretary finds, based on the application, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount and duration of the proposed passenger facility fee will result in revenue (including interest and other returns on the revenue) that is not more than the amount necessary to finance the specific project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) each project is an eligible airport-related project that will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) preserve or enhance capacity, safety, or security of the national air transportation system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reduce noise resulting from an airport that is part of the system; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provide an opportunity for enhanced competition between or among air carriers and foreign air carriers; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the application includes adequate justification for each of the specific projects.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Limitations on Imposing Fees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An eligible agency may impose a passenger facility fee only&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if the Secretary approves an application that the agency has submitted under subsection (c) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) subject to terms the Secretary may prescribe to carry out the objectives of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A passenger facility fee may not be collected from a passenger&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for more than 2 boardings on a one-way trip or a trip in each direction of a round trip;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for the boarding to an eligible place under subchapter II of chapter 417 of this title for which essential air service compensation is paid under subchapter II; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:536 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) enplaning at an airport if the passenger did not pay for the air transportation which resulted in such enplanement, including any case in which the passenger obtained the ticket for the air transportation with a frequent flier award coupon without monetary payment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Limitations on Contracts, Leases, and Use Agreements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A contract between an air carrier or foreign air carrier and an eligible agency made at any time may not impair the authority of the agency to impose a passenger facility fee or to use the passenger facility revenue as provided in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A project financed with a passenger facility fee may not be subject to an exclusive long-term lease or use agreement of an air carrier or foreign air carrier, as defined by regulations of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A lease or use agreement of an air carrier or foreign air carrier related to a project whose construction or expansion was financed with a passenger facility fee may not restrict the eligible agency from financing, developing, or assigning new capacity at the airport with passenger facility revenue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Treatment of Revenue</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Passenger facility revenue is not airport revenue for purposes of establishing a price under a contract between an eligible agency and an air carrier or foreign air carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An eligible agency may not include in its price base the part of the capital costs of a project paid for by using passenger facility revenue to establish a price under a contract between the agency and an air carrier or foreign air carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For a project for terminal development, gates and related areas, or a facility occupied or used by at least one air carrier or foreign air carrier on an exclusive or preferential basis, a price payable by an air carrier or foreign air carrier using the facilities must at least equal the price paid by an air carrier or foreign air carrier using a similar facility at the airport that was not financed with passenger facility revenue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Passenger facility revenues that are held by an air carrier or an agent of the carrier after collection of a passenger facility fee constitute a trust fund that is held by the air carrier or agent for the beneficial interest of the eligible agency imposing the fee. Such carrier or agent holds neither legal nor equitable interest in the passenger facility revenues except for any handling fee or retention of interest collected on unremitted proceeds as may be allowed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Compliance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) As necessary to ensure compliance with this section, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations requiring recordkeeping and auditing of accounts maintained by an air carrier or foreign air carrier and its agent collecting a passenger facility fee and by the eligible agency imposing the fee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary periodically shall audit and review the use by an eligible agency of passenger facility revenue. After review and a public hearing, the Secretary may end any part of the authority of the agency to impose a passenger facility fee to the extent the Secretary decides that the revenue is not being used as provided in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may set off amounts necessary to ensure compliance with this section against amounts otherwise payable to an eligible agency under subchapter I of chapter 471 of this title if the Secretary decides a passenger facility fee is excessive or that passenger facility revenue is not being used as provided in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall prescribe regulations necessary to carry out this section. The regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may prescribe the time and form by which a passenger facility fee takes effect; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) require an air carrier or foreign air carrier and its agent to collect a passenger facility fee that an eligible agency imposes under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establish procedures for handling and remitting money collected;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) ensure that the money, less a uniform amount the Secretary determines reflects the average necessary and reasonable expenses (net of interest accruing to the carrier and agent after collection and before remittance) incurred in collecting and handling the fee, is paid promptly to the eligible agency for which they are collected; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) require that the amount collected for any air transportation be noted on the ticket for that air transportation.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Restrictions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe a regulation or issue an order restricting the marketability, flexibility, accessibility, or variety of charter air transportation provided under a certificate issued under section 41102 of this title only to the extent required by the public interest. A regulation prescribed or order issued under this subsection may not be more restrictive than a regulation related to charter air transportation that was in effect on October 1, 1978.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Alaska</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier holding a certificate issued under section 41102 of this title may provide charter air transportation between places in Alaska only to the extent the Secretary decides the transportation is required by public convenience and necessity. The Secretary may make that decision when issuing, amending, or modifying the certificate. This subsection does not apply to a certificate issued under section 41102 to a citizen of the United States who, before July 1, 1977&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) maintained a principal place of business in Alaska; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) conducted air transport operations between places in Alaska with aircraft with a certificate for gross takeoff weight of more than 40,000 pounds.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Suspensions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall suspend for not more than 30 days any part of the certificate of a charter air carrier if the Secretary decides that the failure of the carrier to comply with the requirements described in sections 41110(e) and 41112 of this title, or a regulation or order of the Secretary under section 41110(e) or 41112, requires immediate suspension in the interest of the rights, welfare, or safety of the public. The Secretary may act under this paragraph without notice or a hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall begin immediately a hearing to decide if the certificate referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection should be amended, modified, suspended, or revoked. Until the hearing is completed, the Secretary may suspend the certificate for additional periods totaling not more than 60 days. If the Secretary decides that the carrier is complying with the requirements described in sections 41110(e) and 41112 of this title and regulations and orders under sections 41110(e) and 41112, the Secretary immediately may end the suspension period and proceeding begun under this subsection. However, the Secretary is not prevented from imposing a civil penalty on the carrier for violating the requirements described in section 41110(e) or 41112 or a regulation or order under section 41110(e) or 41112.</p>

The bond or security must be sufficient to ensure the carrier adequately will pay the passengers and shippers when the transportation the carrier agrees to provide is not provided. The Secretary shall prescribe the amounts to be paid under this subsection.</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. The Secretary of Transportation is designated and empowered to receive on behalf of the President any decision of the Department of Transportation (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;DOT&rdquo;) subject to Section 801 of the Federal Aviation Act, as amended.

<p class="note-body">(c) At the same time that decisions of the DOT are received by the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to section 2 of this Order, the DOT shall transmit copies thereof to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and any other Executive department or agency that the DOT deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, or their designees, shall review the decisions of the DOT transmitted pursuant to section 3(c) of this Order and shall promptly advise the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs or his designee whether action pursuant to Executive Order No. 12356 is deemed appropriate. If, after considering these recommendations, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs determines that classification under Executive Order No. 12356 is appropriate, he shall take such action and immediately so inform the DOT. Action pursuant to this subsection shall be completed by the persons designated herein within 5 days of the transmission of the decision.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) On and after the 6th day following transmission of a DOT decision pursuant to section 3(c) of this Order, or upon earlier notification by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs or his designee, the DOT is authorized to disclose all unclassified portions of the text of such decision. Nothing in this section is intended to affect the ability to withhold material under any Executive order or statute other than Section 801.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. (a) Departments and agencies outside of the Executive Office of the President shall raise only matters of national defense or foreign relations in the course of the presidential review established by this Order. All other matters, including those related to regulatory policy, shall be presented to the DOT in accordance with the procedures of the DOT.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Departments and agencies outside of the Executive Office of the President that identify matters of national defense or foreign relations while a decision is pending before the DOT shall, except as confidentiality is required for reasons of defense or foreign policy, make those matters known to the DOT in the course of its proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. (a) The DOT shall receive the recommendations, addressed to the President, of the departments and agencies referred to in section 3(c) of this Order.</p>

(a) In advising the President with respect to his review of a decision pursuant to Section 801, departments and agencies outside of the Executive Office of the President shall identify with particularity the defense or foreign policy implications of the DOT decision that are deemed appropriate for consideration.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) If any department or agency that made recommendations to the President pursuant to Section 801 believes that, if the President decides not to disapprove a decision, the letter so advising the DOT should include a statement that the decision not to disapprove was based on national defense or foreign relations reasons, it should so indicate separately and explain why.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. Individuals within the Executive Office of the President shall follow a policy of: (a) refusing to discuss matters relating to the disposition of a case subject to the review of the President under Section 801 with any interested private party, or an attorney or agent for any such party, prior to the decision by the President or his designee; and (b) referring any written communication from an interested private party, or an <!-- PDFPage:557 -->attorney or agent for any such party, to the appropriate department or agency outside of the Executive Office of the President.

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. Departments and agencies outside of the Executive Office of the President that regularly make recommendations in connection with the presidential review pursuant to Section 801 shall, consistent with applicable law, including the provisions of Chapter 5 of Title 5 of the United States Code:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) establish public dockets for all written communications (other than those requiring confidential treatment for defense or foreign policy reasons) between their officers and employees and private parties in connection with the preparation of such recommendations; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) prescribe such other procedures governing oral and written communications as they deem appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9. This Order is intended solely for the internal guidance of the departments and agencies in order to facilitate the presidential review process. This Order does not confer rights on any private parties.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 10. None of the time deadlines specified in this Order shall be construed as a limitation on expedited presidential review of any decision under Section 801.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 11. The provisions of this Order shall become effective upon publication in the Federal Register and shall govern the review of any proposed decisions of the DOT that have not become final prior to that date under Executive Order No. 12547.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;41310. Discriminatory practices</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier or foreign air carrier may not subject a person, place, port, or type of traffic in foreign air transportation to unreasonable discrimination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Review and Negotiation of Discriminatory Foreign Charges</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation shall survey charges imposed on an air carrier by the government of a foreign country or another foreign entity for the use of airport property or airway property in foreign air transportation. If the Secretary of Transportation decides that a charge is discriminatory, the Secretary promptly shall report the decision to the Secretary of State. The Secretaries of State and Transportation promptly shall begin negotiations with the appropriate government to end the discrimination. If the discrimination is not ended in a reasonable time through negotiation, the Secretary of Transportation shall establish a compensating charge equal to the discriminatory charge. With the approval of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury shall impose the compensating charge on a foreign air carrier of that country as a condition to accepting the general declaration of the aircraft of the foreign air carrier when it lands or takes off.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:559 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of the Treasury shall maintain an account to credit money collected under paragraph (1) of this subsection. An air carrier shall be paid from the account an amount certified by the Secretary of Transportation to compensate the air carrier for the discriminatory charge paid to the government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Actions Against Discriminatory Activity</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation may take actions the Secretary considers are in the public interest to eliminate an activity of a government of a foreign country or another foreign entity, including a foreign air carrier, when the Secretary, on the initiative of the Secretary or on complaint, decides that the activity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is an unjustifiable or unreasonable discriminatory, predatory, or anticompetitive practice against an air carrier; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) imposes an unjustifiable or unreasonable restriction on access of an air carrier to a foreign market.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation may deny, amend, modify, suspend, revoke, or transfer under paragraph (1) of this subsection a foreign air carrier permit or tariff under section 41302, 41303, 41304(a), 41504(c), 41507, or 41509 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Filing of, and Acting on, Complaints</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An air carrier or a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government may file a complaint under subsection (c) of this section with the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary shall approve, deny, or dismiss the complaint, set the complaint for a hearing or investigation, or begin another proceeding proposing remedial action not later than 60 days after receiving the complaint. The Secretary may extend the period for acting for additional periods totaling not more than 30 days if the Secretary decides that with additional time it is likely that a complaint can be resolved satisfactorily through negotiations with the government of the foreign country or foreign entity. The Secretary must act not later than 90 days after receiving the complaint. However, the Secretary may extend this 90-day period for not more than an additional 90 days if, on the last day of the initial 90-day period, the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) negotiations with the government have progressed to a point that a satisfactory resolution of the complaint appears imminent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an air carrier has not been subjected to economic injury by the government or entity as a result of filing the complaint; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the public interest requires additional time before the Secretary acts on the complaint.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In carrying out paragraph (1) of this subsection and subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) solicit the views of the Secretaries of Commerce and State and the United States Trade Representative;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) give an affected air carrier or foreign air carrier reasonable notice and an opportunity to submit written evidence and arguments within the time limits of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) submit to the President under section 41307 or 41509(f) of this title actions proposed by the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretaries of State, the Treasury, and Transportation and the heads of other departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Government shall keep under review, to the extent of each of their jurisdictions, each form of discrimination or unfair competitive practice to which an air carrier is subject when providing foreign air transportation. Each Secretary and head shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) take appropriate action to eliminate any discrimination or unfair competitive practice found to exist; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) request Congress to enact legislation when the authority to eliminate the discrimination or unfair practice is inadequate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation shall report to Congress annually on each action taken under paragraph (1) of this subsection and on the continuing program to eliminate discrimination and unfair competitive practices. The Secretaries of State and the Treasury each shall give the Secretary of Transportation information necessary to prepare the report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 30 days after acting on a complaint under this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall report to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate on action taken under this section on the complaint.</p>

The words &ldquo;foreign air transportation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;air transportation&rdquo; because 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(C) provides that 49 App.:1374 no longer applies to interstate or overseas air transportation except insofar as 49 App.:1374 requires air carriers to provide safe and adequate service.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Filing and Contents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the way prescribed by regulation by the Secretary of Transportation, every air carrier and foreign air carrier shall file with the Secretary, publish, and keep open to public inspection, tariffs showing the prices for the foreign air transportation provided between places served by the carrier and provided between places served by the carrier and places served by another air carrier or foreign air carrier with which through service and joint prices have been established. A tariff&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall contain&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:563 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to the extent the Secretary requires by regulation, a description of the classifications, rules, and practices related to the foreign air transportation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a statement of the prices in money that is not money of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) information that is required under the laws of a foreign country in or to which the air carrier or foreign air carrier is authorized to operate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Changes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, an air carrier or foreign air carrier may change a price or a classification, rule, or practice affecting that price or the value of the transportation provided under that price, specified in a tariff of the carrier for foreign air transportation only after 30 days after the carrier has filed, published, and posted notice of the proposed change in the same way as required for a tariff under subsection (a) of this section. However, the Secretary may prescribe an alternative notice requirement, of at least 25 days, to allow an air carrier or foreign air carrier to match a proposed change in a passenger fare or a charge of another air carrier or foreign air carrier. A notice under this paragraph must state plainly the change proposed and when the change will take effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the effect of a proposed change would be to begin a passenger fare that is outside of, or not covered by, the range of passenger fares specified under section 41509(e)(2) and (3) of this title, the proposed change may be put into effect only on the expiration of 60 days after the notice is filed under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Rejection of Changes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may reject a tariff or tariff change that is not consistent with this section and regulations prescribed by the Secretary. A tariff or change that is rejected is void.</p>

<p class="note-body">In this section, the words &ldquo;foreign air transportation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;air transportation&rdquo; because 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(B) provides that 49 App.:1373 no longer applies to interstate or overseas air transportation and 49 App.:1376(a)&ndash;(e), restated in section 41901 of the revised title, governs rates for the transportation of mail by aircraft. See section 40102(a) of the revised title defining &ldquo;air transportation&rdquo; to mean interstate or foreign air transportation or the transportation of mail by aircraft. The words &ldquo;passenger fare&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;fare&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the word &ldquo;print&rdquo; is omitted as being included in &ldquo;publish&rdquo;.

In clause (1)(A), the word &ldquo;services&rdquo; is omitted as being included in &ldquo;practices&rdquo;. In clauses (1)(B) and (2)(A), the word &ldquo;lawful&rdquo; is omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;for foreign air transportation&rdquo; are added because of 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(B).

The words &ldquo;proposed change in a passenger fare or a charge of another air carrier or foreign air carrier&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;fares or charges specified in another air carrier's or foreign air carrier's proposed tariff&rdquo; for clarity and consistency in this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;not covered by&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;to which such range of fares does not apply&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 1482(d)(4) of this Appendix .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. section 1482(d)(7) of this Appendix&rdquo; are omitted because those sections related to interstate and overseas air transportation and the source provisions restated in this section relate to foreign air transportation. In addition, the text of 49 App.:1551(a)(5)(D) provides that 49 App.:1482(d) ceased to be in effect on January 1, 1985, except as related to foreign air transportation. The reference in the source provisions to &ldquo;section 1482(j)(9) of this Appendix&rdquo; has been restated as though it were a reference to 49 App.:1482(j)(10) to correct an apparent error in the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979 (Public Law 96&ndash;192, 94 Stat. 35). Section 24(b) of S. 1300 of the 96th Congress (the derivative source for the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979), as originally passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, restated section 403(c)(2) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85&ndash;726, 72 Stat. 759) to read as it now does with a cross&ndash;reference to section 1002(j)(9) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. Also contained in those versions of S. 1300 in section 24(a) was an amendment to section 1002(j) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to add a paragraph (9) that contained language identical to what is now section 1002(j)(10) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. When S. 1300 was reported by the conference committee and enacted into law as the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979, section 24(a) had been changed so that a different paragraph (9) was added and what had been paragraph (9) was now designated as a new paragraph (10) to be added. Apparently, when the conference committee redesignated section 1002(j)(9) as <!-- PDFPage:564 -->1002(j)(10) it did not make a corresponding change in the cross&ndash;reference in section 403(c)(2). See 125 Cong. Rec. 26936, 32147, 36939.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, &ldquo;commuter air carrier&rdquo; means an air carrier providing transportation under section 40109(f) of this title that provides at least 5 scheduled roundtrips a week between the same 2 places.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, when the Secretary of Transportation prescribes under section 41508 or 41509 of this title a uniform method generally applicable to establishing joint prices and divisions of joint prices for and between air carriers holding certificates issued under section 41102 of this title, the Secretary shall make that uniform method apply to establishing joint prices and divisions of joint prices for and between air carriers and commuter air carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Notice Required Before Modifying, Suspending, or Ending Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A commuter air carrier that has an agreement with an air carrier to provide transportation for passengers and property that includes through service by the commuter air carrier over the commuter air carrier's routes and air transportation provided by the air carrier shall give the air carrier and the Secretary at least 90 days&rsquo; notice before modifying, suspending, or ending the transportation. If the commuter air carrier does not give that notice, the uniform method of establishing joint prices and divisions of joint prices referred to in subsection (b) of this section does not apply to the commuter air carrier.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the text of 49 App.:1482a(2)(A) is omitted as unnecessary because the definition of &ldquo;air carrier&rdquo; in 49 App.:1301(3) is restated in section 40102(a) of the revised title and applies to this section and because the functions of the Civil Aeronautics Board under 49 App.:1482a were transferred to the Secretary of Transportation by 49 App.:1551(b)(1)(E) and the complete name of the Secretary is used the first time the term appears in a section. The text of 49 App.:1482a(3) is omitted as executed. The reference in the source provisions to &ldquo;section 416(b)(3) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 [49 App. U.S.C. 1386(b)(3)]&rdquo; has been restated as though it were a reference to section 416(b)(4) to correct an apparent error in the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95&ndash;504, 92 Stat. 1705). Section 24 of H.R. 12611 of the 95th Congress (the derivative source for 416(b)(4)), added section 416(b)(3) to the Federal Aviation Act. Section 29(c) added provisions that eventually were classified as 49 App.:1482a. Those provisions contained a reference to section 416(b)(3). When S. 2493 (passed in lieu of the House bill after being amended to contain much of the text of the House bill) was reported by the conference committee and enacted into law, section 32 added what had been a new 416(b)(3) as a new 416(b)(4). However, the conference committee did not make a corresponding change in the cross-reference in section 37(c), that added 49 App.:1482a. See 124 Cong. Rec. 30714, 30716, 36521, 36524. The word &ldquo;scheduled&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;pursuant to flight schedules&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the Secretary of Transportation decides that a division between air carriers, foreign air carriers, or both, of a joint price for foreign air transportation is or will be unreasonable or unreasonably discriminatory against any of those carriers, the Secretary shall prescribe a reasonable division of the joint price among those carriers. The Secretary may order the adjustment in the division of the joint price to be made retroactively to the date the complaint was filed, the date the order for an investigation was made, or a later date the Secretary decides is reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>When Secretary May Act</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may act under this section on the Secretary's own initiative or on a complaint filed with the Secretary and only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;41509. Authority of the Secretary of Transportation to suspend, cancel, and reject tariffs for foreign air transportation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Cancellation and Rejection</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) On the initiative of the Secretary of Transportation or on a complaint filed with the Secretary, the Secretary may conduct a hearing to decide whether a price for foreign air transportation contained in an existing or newly filed tariff of an air carrier or foreign air carrier, a classification, rule, or practice affecting that price, or the value of the transportation provided under that price, is lawful. The Secretary may begin the hearing at once and without an answer or another formal pleading by the air carrier or foreign air carrier, but only after reasonable notice. If, after the hearing, the Secretary decides that the price, classification, rule, or practice is or will be unreasonable or unreasonably discriminatory, the Secretary may cancel or reject the tariff and prevent the use of the price, classification, rule, or practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With or without a hearing, the Secretary may cancel or reject an existing or newly filed tariff of a foreign air carrier and prevent the use of a price, classification, rule, or practice when the Secretary decides that the cancellation or rejection is in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In deciding whether to cancel or reject a tariff of an air carrier or foreign air carrier under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:566 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effect of the price on the movement of traffic;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the need in the public interest of adequate and efficient transportation by air carriers and foreign air carriers at the lowest cost consistent with providing the transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the standards prescribed under law related to the character and quality of transportation to be provided by air carriers and foreign air carriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the inherent advantages of transportation by aircraft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the need of the air carrier and foreign air carrier for revenue sufficient to enable the air carrier and foreign air carrier, under honest, economical, and efficient management, to provide adequate and efficient air carrier and foreign air carrier transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) whether the price will be predatory or tend to monopolize competition among air carriers and foreign air carriers in foreign air transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) reasonably estimated or foreseeable future costs and revenues for the air carrier or foreign air carrier for a reasonably limited future period during which the price would be in effect; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) other factors.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Suspension</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) Pending a decision under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary may suspend a tariff and the use of a price contained in the tariff or a classification, rule, or practice affecting that price.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may suspend a tariff of a foreign air carrier and the use of a price, classification, rule, or practice when the suspension is in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A suspension becomes effective when the Secretary files with the tariff and delivers to the air carrier or foreign air carrier affected by the suspension a written statement of the reasons for the suspension. To suspend a tariff, reasonable notice of the suspension must be given to the affected carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The suspension of a newly filed tariff may be for periods totaling not more than 365 days after the date the tariff otherwise would go into effect. The suspension of an existing tariff may be for periods totaling not more than 365 days after the effective date of the suspension. The Secretary may rescind at any time the suspension of a newly filed tariff and allow the price, classification, rule, or practice to go into effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Effective Tariffs and Prices When Tariff Is Suspended, Canceled, or Rejected</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If a tariff is suspended pending the outcome of a proceeding under subsection (a) of this section and the Secretary does not take final action in the proceeding during the suspension period, the tariff goes into effect at the end of that period subject to cancellation when the proceeding is concluded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) During the period of suspension, or after the cancellation or rejection, of a newly filed tariff (including a tariff that has gone into effect provisionally), the affected air carrier or foreign air carrier shall maintain in effect and use&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the corresponding seasonal prices, or the classifications, rules, and practices affecting those prices or the value of transportation provided under those prices, that were in effect for the carrier immediately before the new tariff was filed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) another price provided for under an applicable intergovernmental agreement or understanding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the suspended, canceled, or rejected tariff is the first tariff of the carrier for the covered transportation, the carrier, for the purpose of operations during the period of suspension or pending effectiveness of a new tariff, may file another tariff containing a price or another classification, rule, or practice affecting the price, or the value of the transportation provided under the price, that is in effect (and not subject to a suspension order) for any air carrier providing the same transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If an existing tariff is suspended or canceled, the affected air carrier or foreign air carrier, for the purpose of operations during the period of suspension or pending effectiveness of a new tariff, may file another tariff containing a price or another classification, rule, or practice affecting the price, or the value of the transportation provided under the price, that is in effect (and not subject to a suspension order) for any air carrier providing the same transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Response to Refusal of Foreign Country To Allow Air Carrier To Charge a Price</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the Secretary finds that the government or an aeronautical authority of a foreign country has refused to allow an air carrier to charge a price contained in a tariff filed and published under section 41504 of this title for foreign air transportation to the foreign country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary, without a hearing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may suspend any existing tariff of a foreign air carrier providing transportation between the United States and the foreign country for periods totaling not more than 365 days after the date of the suspension; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may order the foreign air carrier to charge, during the suspension periods, prices that are the same as those contained in a tariff (designated by the Secretary) of an air carrier filed and published under section 41504 of this title for foreign air transportation to the foreign country; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a foreign air carrier may continue to provide foreign air transportation to the foreign country only if the government or aeronautical authority of the foreign country allows an air carrier to start or continue foreign air transportation to the foreign country at the prices designated by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Standard Foreign Fare Level</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) In this subsection, &ldquo;standard foreign fare level&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) for a class of fares existing on October 1, 1979, the fare between 2 places (as adjusted under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph) filed for and allowed by the Civil Aeronautics Board to go into effect after September 30, 1979, and before August 13, 1980 (with seasonal fares adjusted by the percentage difference that prevailed between seasons in 1978), or the fare established under section 1002(j)(8) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85&ndash;726, 72 Stat. 731), as added by section 24(a) of the International Air Transportation Competi<!-- PDFPage:567 -->tion Act of 1979 (Public Law 96&ndash;192, 94 Stat. 46); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for a class of fares established after October 1, 1979, the fare between 2 places in effect on the effective date of the establishment of the new class.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) At least once every 60 days for fuel costs, and at least once every 180 days for other costs, the Secretary shall adjust the standard foreign fare level for the particular foreign air transportation to which the standard foreign fare level applies by increasing or decreasing that level by the percentage change from the last previous period in the actual operating cost for each available seat-mile. In adjusting a standard foreign fare level, the Secretary may not make an adjustment to costs actually incurred. In establishing a standard foreign fare level and making adjustments in the level under this paragraph, the Secretary may use all relevant or appropriate information reasonably available to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not decide that a proposed fare for foreign air transportation is unreasonable on the basis that the fare is too low or too high if the proposed fare is neither more than 5 percent higher nor 50 percent lower than the standard foreign fare level for the same or essentially similar class of transportation. The Secretary by regulation may increase the 50 percent specified in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Paragraph (2) of this subsection does not apply to a proposed fare that is not more than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 5 percent higher than the standard foreign fare level when the Secretary decides that the proposed fare may be unreasonably discriminatory or that suspension of the fare is in the public interest because of an unreasonable regulatory action by the government of a foreign country that is related to a fare proposal of an air carrier; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 50 percent lower than the standard foreign fare level when the Secretary decides that the proposed fare may be predatory or discriminatory or that suspension of the fare is required because of an unreasonable regulatory action by the government of a foreign country that is related to a fare proposal of an air carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Submission of Orders to President</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall submit to the President an order made under this section suspending, canceling, or rejecting a price for foreign air transportation, and an order rescinding the effectiveness of such an order, before publishing the order. Not later than 10 days after its submission, the President may disapprove the order on finding disapproval is necessary for United States foreign policy or national defense reasons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Compliance as Condition of Certificate or Permit</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section and compliance with an order of the Secretary under this section are conditions to any certificate or permit held by an air carrier or foreign air carrier. An air carrier or foreign air carrier may provide foreign air transportation only as long as the carrier maintains prices for that transportation that comply with this section and orders of the Secretary under this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Making Slots Available for Essential Air Service.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Operational authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If basic essential air service under subchapter II of this chapter is to be provided from an eligible point to a high density airport (other than Washington National Airport), the Secretary of Transportation shall ensure that the air carrier providing or selected to provide such service has sufficient operational authority at the high density airport to provide such service. The operational authority shall allow flights at reasonable times taking into account the needs of passengers with connecting flights.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If necessary to carry out the objectives of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall by order grant exemptions from the requirements of subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at high density airports), to air carriers using Stage 3 aircraft or to commuter air carriers, unless such an exemption would significantly increase operational delays.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Assurance of access</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary finds that an exemption under paragraph (2) would significantly increase operational delays, the Secretary shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that an air carrier providing or selected to provide basic essential air service is able to obtain access to a high density airport; except that the Secretary shall not be required to make slots available at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, if the number of slots available for basic essential air service (including slots specifically designated as essential air service slots and slots used for such purposes) to and from such airport is at least 132 slots.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Action by the secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall issue a final order under this subsection on or before the 60th day after receiving a request from an air carrier for operational authority under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Slots for Foreign Air Transportation.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary finds it to be in the public interest at a high density airport (other than Washington National Airport), the Secretary may grant by order exemptions from the requirements of subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at high density airports), to enable air carriers and foreign air carriers to provide foreign air transportation using Stage 3 aircraft.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Slot withdrawals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not withdraw a slot from an air carrier in order to allocate that slot to a carrier to provide foreign air transportation if the withdrawal of that slot would result in the withdrawal of slots from an air carrier at O'Hare International Airport under section 93.223 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, in excess of the total withdrawn from that air carrier as of October 31, 1993.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Equivalent rights of access</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall not take a slot at a high density airport from an air carrier and award such slot to a foreign air carrier if the Secretary determines that air carriers are not provided equivalent rights of access to airports in the country of which such foreign air carrier is a citizen.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Period of effectiveness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subsection and exemptions issued under this subsection shall cease to be in effect when the final rules issued under subsection (f) become effective.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Slots for New Entrants.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary finds it to be in the public interest and the circumstances to be exceptional, the Secretary may by order grant exemptions from the requirements under subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at high density airports), to enable new entrant air carriers to provide air transportation at high density airports (other than Washington National Airport).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Period of effectiveness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Exemptions issued under this subsection shall cease to be in effect on or after the date on which the final rules issued under subsection (f) become effective.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Special Rules for Washington National Airport.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding sections 6005(c)(5) and 6009(e) of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Act of 1986, or any provision of this section, the Secretary may, only under circumstances determined by the Secretary to be exceptional, grant by order to an air carrier currently holding or operating a slot at Washington National Airport an exemption from requirements under subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at Washington National Airport), to enable that carrier to provide air transportation with Stage 3 aircraft at Washington National Airport; except that such exemption shall not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) result in an increase in the total number of slots per day at Washington National Airport;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) result in an increase in the total number of slots at Washington National Airport from 7:00 ante meridiem to 9:59 post meridiem;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) increase the number of operations at Washington National Airport in any 1-hour period by more than 2 operations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) result in the withdrawal or reduction of slots operated by an air carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) result in a net increase in noise impact on surrounding communities resulting from changes in timing of operations permitted under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) continue in effect on or after the date on which the final rules issued under subsection (f) become effective.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on applicability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this subsection shall adversely affect Exemption No. 5133, as from time-to-time amended and extended.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Study.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<!-- PDFPage:576 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Matters to be considered</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall continue the Secretary's current examination of slot regulations and shall ensure that the examination includes consideration of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether improvements in technology and procedures of the air traffic control system and the use of quieter aircraft make it possible to eliminate the limitations on hourly operations imposed by the high density rule contained in part 93 of title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations or to increase the number of operations permitted under such rule;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the effects of the elimination of limitations or an increase in the number of operations allowed on each of the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the impact of such allocation process upon the ability of new entrant air carriers to obtain slots in time periods that enable them to provide service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the impact of such allocation process on the ability of foreign air carriers to obtain slots;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the fairness of such process to air carriers and the extent to which air carriers are provided equivalent rights of access to the air transportation market in the countries of which foreign air carriers holding slots are citizens;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the impact, on the ability of air carriers to provide domestic and international air service, of the withdrawal of slots from air carriers in order to provide slots for foreign air carriers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) the impact of the prohibition on slot withdrawals in subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section on the aviation relationship between the United States Government and foreign governments, including whether the prohibition in such subsections will require the withdrawal of slots from general and military aviation in order to meet the needs of air carriers and foreign air carriers providing foreign air transportation (and the impact of such withdrawal on general aviation and military aviation) and whether slots will become available to meet the needs of air carriers and foreign air carriers to provide foreign air transportation as a result of the planned relocation of Air Force Reserve units and the Air National Guard at O'Hare International Airport.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than January 31, 1995, the Secretary shall complete the current examination of slot regulations and shall transmit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives a report containing the results of such examination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Weekend Operations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall consider the advisability of revising section 93.227 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, so as to eliminate weekend schedules from the determination of whether the 80 percent standard of subsection (a)(1) of that section has been met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section and section 41734(h), the following definitions apply:</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Decisions Made Before October</cap-smallcap> 1, 1988.&mdash;For each eligible place for which a decision was made before October 1, 1988, under section 419 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, establishing the level of essential air transportation, the level of basic essential air service for that place shall be the level established by the Secretary of Transportation for that place by not later than December 29, 1988.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Decisions Not Made Before October</cap-smallcap> 1, 1988.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall decide on the level of basic essential air service for each eligible place for which a decision was not made before October 1, 1988, establishing the level of essential air transportation, when the Secretary receives notice that service to that place will be provided by only one air carrier. The Secretary shall make the decision by the last day of the 6-month period beginning on the date the Secretary receives the notice. The Secretary may impose notice requirements necessary to carry out this subsection. Before making a decision, the Secretary shall consider the views of any interested community and the appropriate State authority of the State in which the community is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Until the Secretary has made a decision on a level of basic essential air service for an eligible place under this subsection, the Secretary, on petition by an appropriate representative of the place, shall prohibit an air carrier from ending, suspending, or reducing air transportation to that place that appears to deprive the place of basic essential air service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Availability of Compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Secretary decides that basic essential air service will not be provided to an eligible place without compensation, the Secretary shall provide notice that an air carrier may apply to provide basic essential air service to the place for compensation under this section. In selecting an applicant, the Secretary shall consider, among other factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the demonstrated reliability of the applicant in providing scheduled air service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the contractual and marketing arrangements the applicant has made with a larger carrier to ensure service beyond the hub airport;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the interline arrangements that the applicant has made with a larger carrier to allow passengers and cargo of the applicant at the hub airport to be transported by the larger carrier through one reservation, ticket, and baggage check-in;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the preferences of the actual and potential users of air transportation at the eligible place, giving substantial weight to the views of the elected officials representing the users; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) for an eligible place in Alaska, the experience of the applicant in providing, in Alaska, scheduled air service, or significant patterns of non-scheduled air service under an exemption granted under section 40109(a) and (c)&ndash;(h) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under guidelines prescribed under section 41737(a) of this title, the Secretary shall pay the rate of compensation for providing basic essential air service under this section and section 41734 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Compensation Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall pay compensation under this section at times and in the way the Secretary decides is appropriate. The Secretary shall end payment of compensation to an air carrier for providing basic essential air service to an eligible place when the Secretary decides the compensation is no longer necessary to maintain basic essential air service to the place.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall review periodically the level of basic essential air service for each eligible place. Based on the review and consultations with an interested community and the appropriate State authority of the State in which the community is located, the Secretary may make appropriate adjustments in the level of service.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Notice Required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier may end, suspend, or reduce air transportation to an eligible place below the level of basic essential air service established for that place under section 41733 of this title only after giving the Secretary of Transportation, the appropriate State authority, and the affected communities at least 90 days&rsquo; notice before ending, suspending, or reducing that transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Continuation of Service for</cap-smallcap> 30 <cap-smallcap>Days After Notice Period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If at the end of the notice period under subsection (a) of this section the Secretary has not found another air carrier to provide basic essential air service to the eligible place, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing notice to continue to provide basic essential air service to the place for an additional 30-day period or until another carrier begins to provide basic essential air service to the place, whichever occurs first.</p>

At the end of each 30-day period, the Secretary shall decide if another carrier will provide service on a continuing basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Continuation of Compensation After Notice Period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If an air carrier receiving compensation under section 41733 of this title for providing basic essential air service to an eligible place is required to continue to provide service to the place under this section after the 90-day notice period under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall continue to pay that compensation after the last day of that period. The Secretary shall pay the compensation until the Secretary finds another carrier to provide the service to the place or the 90th day after the end of that notice period, whichever is earlier. If, after the 90th day after the end of the 90-day notice period, the Secretary has not found another carrier to provide the service, the carrier required to continue to provide that service shall receive compensation sufficient&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to pay for the fully allocated actual cost to the carrier of performing the basic essential air service that was being provided when the 90-day notice was given under subsection (a) of this section plus a reasonable return on investment that is at least 5 percent of operating costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide the carrier an additional return that recognizes the demonstrated additional lost profits from opportunities foregone and the likelihood that those lost profits increase as the period during which the carrier is required to provide the service continues.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Compensation to Air Carriers Originally Providing Service Without Compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary requires an air carrier providing basic essential air service to an eligible place without compensation under section 41733 of this title to continue providing that service after the 90-day notice period required by subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall provide the carrier with compensation after the end of the 90-day notice period that is sufficient&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to pay for the fully allocated actual cost to the carrier of performing the basic essential air service that was being provided when the 90-day notice was given under subsection (a) of this section plus a reasonable return on investment that is at least 5 percent of operating costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide the carrier an additional return that recognizes the demonstrated additional lost profits from opportunities foregone and the likelihood that those lost profits increase as the period during which the carrier is required to provide the service continues.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Finding Replacement Carriers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the Secretary requires an air carrier to continue to provide basic essential air service to an eligible place, the Secretary shall continue to make every effort to find another carrier to provide at least that basic essential air service to the place on a continuing basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Transfer of Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If an air carrier, providing basic essential air service under section 41733 of this title between an eligible place and an airport at which the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration limits the number of instrument flight rule takeoffs and landings of aircraft, provides notice under subsection (a) of this section of an intention to end, suspend, or reduce that service and another carrier is found to provide the service, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing notice to transfer any operational authority the carrier has to land or take off at that airport related to the service to the eligible place to the carrier that will provide the service, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the carrier that will provide the service needs the authority; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the authority to be transferred is being used to provide air service to another eligible place.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Nonconsideration of Slot Availability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining what is basic essential air service and in selecting an air carrier to provide such service, the Secretary shall not consider as a factor whether slots at a high density airport are available for providing such service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Compensation Guidelines</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe guidelines governing the rate of compensation payable under this subchapter. The guidelines shall be used to determine the reasonable amount of compensation required to ensure the continuation of air service or air transportation under this subchapter. The guidelines shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide for a reduction in compensation when an air carrier does not provide service or transportation agreed to be provided;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) consider amounts needed by an air carrier to promote public use of the service or transportation for which compensation is being paid; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) include expense elements based on representative costs of air carriers providing scheduled air transportation of passengers, property, and mail on aircraft of the type the Secretary decides is appropriate for providing the service or transportation for which compensation is being provided.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Promotional amounts described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall be a special, segregated element of the compensation provided to a carrier under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Required Finding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may pay compensation to an air carrier for providing air service or air transportation under this subchapter only if the Secretary finds the carrier is able to provide the service or transportation in a reliable way.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Claims</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 15 days after receiving a written claim from an air carrier for compensation under this subchapter, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) pay or deny the United States Government's share of a claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if denying the claim, notify the carrier of the denial and the reasons for the denial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Make Agreements and Incur Obligations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may make agreements and incur obligations from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund established under section 9502 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 9502) to pay compensation under this subchapter. An agreement by the Secretary under this subsection is a contractual obligation of the Government to pay the Government's share of the compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not more than $38,600,000 is available to the Secretary out of the Fund for each of the fiscal years ending September 30, 1993&ndash;1998, to incur obligations under this section. Amounts made available under this section remain available until expended.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is substituted for 49 App.:1551(b)(1)(D) to make clear that the United States Postal Service derives its authority to provide for the transportation of mail by aircraft in interstate transportation from 39:5402(d) and (f). The text of 49 App.:1376(a) (1st sentence related to non-Alaska interstate and overseas air transportation less words between parentheses) is omitted as superseded by 39:5402(d).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;Except as provided in section 5402 of title 39&rdquo; are added for clarity. The words &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; in 49 App.:1376(a) are omitted as surplus. The text of 49 App.:1376(a) (2d, last sentences) is omitted as executed. In clauses (1) and (2), the word &ldquo;prices&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;rates of compensation&rdquo; for consistency in this part. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;an opportunity for a hearing on the record&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;hearing&rdquo; for clarity and consistency with subsection (f) of this section.

See the revision notes for subsection (d) of this section. The words &ldquo;out of appropriations for the transportation of mail by aircraft&rdquo; are omitted as being superseded by chapters 20 and 24 of title 39, United States Code. The text of 49 App.:1376(c) (2d sentence) is omitted as expired because of 49 App.:1376(c) (last sentence). The text of 49 App.:1376(c) (last sentence) is omitted as executed. The words &ldquo;and to make such rates effective from such date as it shall determine to be proper&rdquo; in 49 App.:1376(a) are omitted because the power to determine when rates go into effect is included in the power to prescribe rates. The words &ldquo;transportation of mail by aircraft in foreign air transportation or between places in Alaska&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;transportation of mail by aircraft&rdquo; because 49 App.:1551(b)(1)(D) and (E) provides that transportation of mail in interstate or overseas air transportation (except transportation of mail between 2 places in Alaska) is transferred to the jurisdiction of the United States Postal Service leaving the balance of authority under 49 App.:1376(a) with the Secretary of Transportation.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the text of 49 App.:1376(b) (2d sentence words after 2d semicolon, 5th&ndash;7th sentences) and (d) is omitted as obsolete because under 49 App.:1376(c) and 1376a, payments by the Board under 49 App.:1376 were terminated. The text of 49 App.:1376(b) (3d, 4th sentences) is omitted as obsolete because it applies only to rates paid for service performed between October 24, 1978, and January 1, 1983. The text of 49 App.:1376(b) (last sentence) is omitted as executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (g) is substituted for 49 App.:1551(b)(3) and 1553(c) because the date on which the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to provide for the transportation of mail by aircraft expires is set out in 39:5402(f). The source provisions of 49 App.:1551(b)(3) providing for the transfer of that authority from the Secretary to the Postal Service are restated in section 5(k) of this bill.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) &ldquo;protected employee&rdquo; means an individual who on October 24, 1978, had been employed for at least 4 years by an air carrier that held a certificate under section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, but does not include a director or officer of a corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) &ldquo;qualifying dislocation&rdquo; means a bankruptcy or major contraction of an air carrier holding a certificate under section 41102 of this title when the Secretary of Transportation finds the bankruptcy or contraction occurred after December 31, 1978, and before January 1, 1989, the major cause of which was the change in regulatory structure provided by the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Major Contraction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may find a reduction of less than 7.5 percent of the number of full-time employees is part of a major contraction if the Secretary decides another reduction is likely to occur within the 12-month period in which the first reduction occurs that, when included with the first reduction, will result in a total reduction of more than 7.5 percent.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, &ldquo;controlled substance&rdquo; has the same meaning given that term in section 102 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 802).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Revocations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall issue an order revoking the certificate of registration for an aircraft issued to an owner under section 44103 of this title and any other certificate of registration that the owner of the aircraft holds under section 44103, if the Administrator finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the aircraft was used to carry out, or facilitate, an activity that is punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year under a law of the United States or a State related to a controlled substance (except a law related to simple possession of a controlled substance); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the owner of the aircraft permitted the use of the aircraft knowing that the aircraft was to be used for the activity described in clause (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An aircraft owner that is not an individual is deemed to have permitted the use of the aircraft knowing that the aircraft was to be used for the activity described in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection only if a majority of the individuals who control the owner of the aircraft or who are involved in forming the major policy of the owner permitted the use of the aircraft knowing that the aircraft was to be used for the activity described in paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Advice to Holders and Opportunity To Answer</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before the Administrator revokes a certificate under subsection (b) of this section, the Administrator shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) advise the holder of the certificate of the charges or reasons on which the Administrator bases the proposed action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide the holder of the certificate an opportunity to answer the charges and state why the certificate should not be revoked.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Appeals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person whose certificate is revoked by the Administrator under subsection (b) of this section may appeal the revocation order to the National Transportation Safety Board. The Board shall affirm or reverse the order after providing notice and a hearing on the record. In conducting the hearing, the Board is not bound by the findings of fact of the Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When a person files an appeal with the Board under this subsection, the order of the Administrator revoking the certificate is stayed. However, if the Administrator advises the Board that safety in air transportation or air commerce requires the immediate effectiveness of the order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the order remains effective; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Board shall dispose of the appeal not later than 60 days after notification by the Administrator under this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A person substantially affected by an order of the Board under this subsection may seek judicial review of the order under section 46110 of this title. The Administrator shall be made a party to that judicial proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Acquittal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator may not revoke, and the Board may not affirm a revocation of, a certificate of registration under this section on the basis of an activity described in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section if the holder of the certificate is acquitted of all charges related to a controlled substance in an indictment or information arising from the activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Administrator has revoked a certificate of registration of a person under this section because of an activity described in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section, the Administrator shall reissue a certificate to the person if the person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) subsequently is acquitted of all charges related to a controlled substance in an indictment or information arising from the activity; and</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall issue an airman certificate to an individual when the Administrator finds, after investigation, that the individual is qualified for, and physically able to perform the duties related to, the position to be authorized by the certificate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Contents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An airman certificate shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be numbered and recorded by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) contain the name, address, and description of the individual to whom the certificate is issued;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) contain terms the Administrator decides are necessary to ensure safety in air commerce, including terms on the duration of the certificate, periodic or special examinations, and tests of physical fitness;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) specify the capacity in which the holder of the certificate may serve as an airman with respect to an aircraft; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) designate the class the certificate covers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A certificate issued to a pilot serving in scheduled air transportation shall have the designation &ldquo;airline transport pilot&rdquo; of the appropriate class.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Appeals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An individual whose application for the issuance or renewal of an airman certificate has been denied may appeal the denial to the National Transportation Safety Board, except if the individual holds a certificate that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is suspended at the time of denial; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) was revoked within one year from the date of the denial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Board shall conduct a hearing on the appeal at a place convenient to the place of residence or employment of the applicant. The Board is not bound by findings of fact of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration but is bound by all validly adopted interpretations of laws and regulations the Administrator carries out unless the Board finds an interpretation is arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not according to law. At the end of the hearing, the Board shall decide whether the in<!-- PDFPage:624 -->dividual meets the applicable regulations and standards. The Administrator is bound by that decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Restrictions and Prohibitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) restrict or prohibit issuing an airman certificate to an alien; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as provided in section 44710(e)(2) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Modifications in System</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall make modifications in the system for issuing airman certificates necessary to make the system more effective in serving the needs of pilots and officials responsible for enforcing laws related to the regulation of controlled substances (as defined in section 102 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 802)). The modifications shall ensure positive and verifiable identification of each individual applying for or holding a certificate and shall address at least each of the following deficiencies in, and abuses of, the existing system:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the use of fictitious names and addresses by applicants for those certificates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the use of stolen or fraudulent identification in applying for those certificates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the use by an applicant of a post office box or &ldquo;mail drop&rdquo; as a return address to evade identification of the applicant's address.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the use of counterfeit and stolen airman certificates by pilots.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the absence of information about physical characteristics of holders of those certificates.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall prescribe regulations to carry out paragraph (1) of this subsection and provide a written explanation of how the regulations address each of the deficiencies and abuses described in paragraph (1). In prescribing the regulations, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall consult with the Administrator of Drug Enforcement, the Commissioner of Customs, other law enforcement officials of the United States Government, representatives of State and local law enforcement officials, representatives of the general aviation aircraft industry, representatives of users of general aviation aircraft, and other interested persons.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Type Certificates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall issue a type certificate for an aircraft, aircraft engine, or propeller, or for an appliance specified under paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection when the Administrator finds that the aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance is properly designed and manufactured, performs properly, and meets the regulations and minimum standards prescribed under section 44701(a) of this title. On receiving an application for a type certificate, the Administrator shall investigate the application and may conduct a hearing. The Administrator shall make, or require the applicant to make, tests the Administrator considers necessary in the interest of safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specify in regulations those appliances that reasonably require a type certificate in the interest of safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) include in a type certificate terms required in the interest of safety; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) record on the certificate a numerical specification of the essential factors related to the performance of the aircraft, aircraft engine, or propeller for which the certificate is issued.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Supplemental Type Certificates.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Issuance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may issue a type certificate designated as a supplemental type certificate for a change to an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Contents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A supplemental type certificate issued under paragraph (1) shall consist of the change to the aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance with respect to the previously issued type certificate for the aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the holder of a supplemental type certificate agrees to permit another person to use the certificate to modify an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance, the holder shall provide the other person with written evidence, in a form acceptable to the Administrator, of that agreement. A person may change an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance based on a supplemental type certificate only if the person requesting the change is the holder of the supplemental type certificate or has permission from the holder to make the change.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Production Certificates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall issue a production certificate authorizing the production of a duplicate of an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance for which a type certificate has been issued when the Administrator finds the duplicate will conform to the certificate. On receiving an application, the Administrator shall inspect, and may require testing of, a duplicate to ensure that it conforms to the requirements of the certificate. The Administrator may include in a production certificate terms required in the interest of safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Airworthiness Certificates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The registered owner of an aircraft may apply to the Administrator for an airworthiness certificate for the aircraft. The Administrator shall issue an airworthiness certificate when the Administrator finds that the aircraft conforms to its type certificate and, after inspection, is in condition for safe operation. The Administrator shall register each airworthiness certificate and may include appropriate information in the certificate. The certificate number or other individual designation the Administrator requires shall be displayed on the aircraft. The Administrator may include in an airworthiness certificate terms required in the interest of safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person applying for the issuance or renewal of an airworthiness certificate for an aircraft for which ownership has not been recorded under section 44107 or 44110 of this title must submit with the application information related to the ownership of the aircraft the Administrator decides is necessary to identify each person having a property interest in the aircraft and the kind and extent of the interest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any part of a certificate issued under this chapter if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Administrator decides after conducting a reinspection, reexamination, or other investigation that safety in air commerce or air transportation and the public interest require that action; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Board may modify a suspension or revocation of a certificate to imposition of a civil penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) When conducting a hearing under this subsection, the Board is not bound by findings of fact of the Administrator but is bound by all validly adopted interpretations of laws and regulations the Administrator carries out and of written agency policy guidance available to the public related to sanctions to be imposed under this section unless the Board finds an interpretation is arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not according to law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) When an individual files an appeal with the Board under this subsection, the order of the Administrator revoking the certificate is stayed. However, if the Administrator advises the Board that safety in air transportation or air commerce requires the immediate effectiveness of the order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the order remains effective; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Administrator, as the Administrator deems appropriate, shall provide for the participation of a representative of the Environmental Protection Agency on such advisory committees or associated working groups that advise the Administrator on matters related to the environmental effects of aircraft and aircraft engines.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may prescribe standards and regulations under this subsection only after consulting with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The standards and regulations shall be applied when issuing, amending, modifying, suspending, or revoking a certificate authorized under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An original type certificate may be issued under section 44704(a) of this title for an aircraft for which substantial noise abatement can be achieved only after the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration prescribes standards and regulations under this section that apply to that aircraft.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Considerations and Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When prescribing a standard or regulation under this section, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall&mdash;</p>

<!-- PDFPage:634 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) consider the extent to which the standard or regulation will carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Proposed Regulations of Administrator of Environmental Protection Agency</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall submit to the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration proposed regulations to control and abate aircraft noise and sonic boom (including control and abatement through the use of the authority of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration) that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency considers necessary to protect the public health and welfare. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall consider those proposed regulations and shall publish them in a notice of proposed regulations not later than 30 days after they are received. Not later than 60 days after publication, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall begin a hearing at which interested persons are given an opportunity for oral and written presentations. Not later than 90 days after the hearing is completed and after consulting with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prescribe regulations as provided by this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) substantially the same as the proposed regulations submitted by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that amend the proposed regulations; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) publish in the Federal Register&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a notice that no regulation is being prescribed in response to the proposed regulations of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a detailed analysis of, and response to, all information the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency submitted with the proposed regulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a detailed explanation of why no regulation is being prescribed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Consultation and Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency believes that the action of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration under subsection (c)(1)(B) or (2) of this section does not protect the public health and welfare from aircraft noise or sonic boom, consistent with the considerations in subsection (b) of this section, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall consult with the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and may request a report on the advisability of prescribing the regulation as originally proposed. The request, including a detailed statement of the information on which the request is based, shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall report to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency within the time, if any, specified in the request. However, the time specified must be at least 90 days after the date of the request. The report shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be accompanied by a detailed statement of the findings of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the reasons for the findings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) identify any statement related to an action under subsection (c) of this section filed under section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C));</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) specify whether and where that statement is available for public inspection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) be published in the Federal Register unless the request proposes specific action by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the report indicates that action will be taken.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Supplemental Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency may request the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to file a supplemental report if the report under subsection (d) of this section indicates that the proposed regulations under subsection (c) of this section, for which a statement under section 102(2)(C) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is not required, should not be prescribed. The supplemental report shall be published in the Federal Register within the time the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency specifies. However, the time specified must be at least 90 days after the date of the request. The supplemental report shall contain a comparison of the environmental effects, including those that cannot be avoided, of the action of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration and the proposed regulations of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An exemption from a standard or regulation prescribed under this section may be granted only if, before granting the exemption, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration consults with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. However, if the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration finds that safety in air transportation or air commerce requires an exemption before the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency can be consulted, the exemption may be granted. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall consult with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency as soon as practicable after the exemption is granted.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, &ldquo;law enforcement personnel&rdquo; means individuals&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) authorized to carry and use firearms;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) vested with the degree of the police power of arrest the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration considers necessary to carry out this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) identifiable by appropriate indicia of authority.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Protection Against Violence and Piracy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall prescribe regulations to protect passengers and property on an aircraft operating in air transportation or intrastate air transportation against an act of criminal violence or aircraft piracy. When prescribing a regulation under this subsection, the Administrator shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consult with the Secretary of Transportation, the Attorney General, the heads of other departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States Government, and State and local authorities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consider whether a proposed regulation is consistent with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) protecting passengers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the public interest in promoting air transportation and intrastate air transportation;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to the maximum extent practicable, require a uniform procedure for searching and detaining passengers and property to ensure&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) their safety; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Security Programs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator shall prescribe regulations under subsection (b) of this section that require each operator of an airport regularly serving an air carrier holding a certificate issued by the Secretary of Transportation to establish an air transportation security program that provides a law enforcement presence and capability at each of those airports that is adequate to ensure the safety of passengers. The regulations shall authorize the operator to use the services of qualified State, local, and private law enforcement personnel. When the Administrator decides, after being notified by an operator in the form the Administrator prescribes, that not enough qualified State, local, and private law enforcement personnel are available to carry out subsection (b), the Administrator may authorize the operator to use, on a reimbursable basis, personnel employed by the Administrator, or by another department, agency, or instrumentality of the Government with the consent of the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality, to supplement State, local, and private law enforcement personnel. When deciding whether additional personnel are needed, the Administrator shall consider the number of passengers boarded at the airport, the extent of anticipated risk of criminal violence or aircraft piracy at the airport or to the air carrier aircraft operations at the airport, and the availability of qualified State or local law enforcement personnel at the airport.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Administrator may approve a security program of an airport operator, or an amendment in an existing program, that incorporates a security program of an airport tenant <!-- PDFPage:643 -->(except an air carrier separately complying with part 108 or 129 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations) having access to a secured area of the airport, if the program or amendment incorporates&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the measures the tenant will use, within the tenant's leased areas or areas designated for the tenant's exclusive use under an agreement with the airport operator, to carry out the security requirements imposed by the Administrator on the airport operator under the access control system requirements of section 107.14 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, or under other requirements of part 107 of title 14; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the methods the airport operator will use to monitor and audit the tenant's compliance with the security requirements and provides that the tenant will be required to pay monetary penalties to the airport operator if the tenant fails to carry out a security requirement under a contractual provision or requirement imposed by the airport operator.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Administrator approves a program or amendment described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the airport operator may not be found to be in violation of a requirement of this subsection or subsection (b) of this section when the airport operator demonstrates that the tenant or an employee, permittee, or invitee of the tenant is responsible for the violation and that the airport operator has complied with all measures in its security program for securing compliance with its security program by the tenant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Authorizing Individuals To Carry Firearms and Make Arrests</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;With the approval of the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Transportation may authorize an individual who carries out air transportation security duties&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to carry firearms; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to make arrests without warrant for an offense against the United States committed in the presence of the individual or for a felony under the laws of the United States, if the individual reasonably believes the individual to be arrested has committed or is committing a felony.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Exclusive Responsibility Over Passenger Safety</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator has the exclusive responsibility to direct law enforcement activity related to the safety of passengers on an aircraft involved in an offense under section 46502 of this title from the moment all external doors of the aircraft are closed following boarding until those doors are opened to allow passengers to leave the aircraft. When requested by the Administrator, other departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Government shall provide assistance necessary to carry out this subsection.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Deployment and Purchase of Equipment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A deployment or purchase of explosive detection equipment under section 108.7(b)(8) or 108.20 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, or similar regulation is required only if the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration certifies that the equipment alone, or as part of an integrated system, can detect under realistic air carrier operating conditions the amounts, configurations, and types of explosive material that would likely be used to cause catastrophic damage to commercial aircraft. The Administrator shall base the certification on the results of tests conducted under protocols developed in consultation with expert scientists outside of the Administration. Those tests shall be completed not later than April 16, 1992.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before completion of the tests described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, but not later than April 16, 1992, the Administrator may require deployment of explosive detection equipment described in paragraph (1) if the Administrator decides that deployment will enhance aviation security significantly. In making that decision, the Administrator shall consider factors such as the ability of the equipment alone, or as part of an integrated system, to detect under realistic air carrier operating conditions the amounts, configurations, and types of explosive material that would likely be used to cause catastrophic damage to commercial aircraft. The Administrator shall notify the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives of a deployment decision made under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Until such time as the Administrator determines that equipment certified under paragraph (1) is commercially available and has successfully completed operational testing as provided in paragraph (1), the Administrator shall facilitate the deployment of such approved commercially available explosive detection devices as the Administrator determines will enhance aviation security significantly. The Administrator shall require that equipment deployed under this paragraph be replaced by equipment certified under paragraph (1) when equipment certified under paragraph (1) becomes commercially available. The Administrator is authorized, based on operational considerations at individual airports, to waive the required installation of commercially available equipment under paragraph (1) in the interests of aviation security. The Administrator may permit the requirements of this paragraph to be met at airports by the deployment of dogs or other appropriate animals to supplement equipment for screening passengers, baggage, mail, or cargo for explosives or weapons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This subsection does not prohibit the Administrator from purchasing or deploying explosive detection equipment described in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Grants</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may provide grants to continue the Explosive Detection K-9 Team Training Program to detect explosives at airports and on aircraft.</p>

Title VI includes sections 602 and 609 [49 App.:1422, 1429], that provide for appeals to the Civil Aeronautics Board (subsequently transferred to the National Transportation Safety Board), and section 611(e) [49 App.:1431(e)], that provides for appeals to the National Transportation Safety Board. Under 49 App.:1902(a), the National Transportation Safety Board in the Department of Transportation was replaced by an independent National Transportation Safety Board outside the Department, and 49 App.:1903(a)(9)(A) gave the independent Board the authority to review appeals from actions of the Secretary under 49 App.:1422, 1429, and 1431(e).</p>

The action shall conform as nearly as practicable to a civil action in admiralty, regardless of the place an aircraft in a civil action in rem is seized. However, a party may demand a jury trial of an issue of fact in an action involving a civil penalty under this chapter (except a penalty imposed by the Secretary of Transportation that formerly was imposed by the Civil Aeronautics Board) if the value of the matter in controversy is more than $20.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;47101. Policies</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the safe operation of the airport and airway system is the highest aviation priority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that aviation facilities be constructed and operated to minimize current and projected noise impact on nearby communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to give special emphasis to developing reliever airports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that appropriate provisions should be made to make the development and enhancement of cargo hub airports easier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to encourage the development of transportation systems that use various modes of transportation in a way that will serve the States and local communities efficiently and effectively;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) that airport development projects under this subchapter provide for the protection and enhancement of natural resources and the quality of the environment of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) that airport construction and improvement projects that increase the capacity of facilities to accommodate passenger and cargo traffic be undertaken to the maximum feasible extent so that safety and efficiency increase and delays decrease;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) to ensure that nonaviation usage of the navigable airspace be accommodated but not allowed to decrease the safety and capacity of the airspace and airport system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) that artificial restrictions on airport capacity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are not in the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) should be imposed to alleviate air traffic delays only after other reasonably available and less burdensome alternatives have been tried; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) should not discriminate unjustly between categories and classes of aircraft;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) that special emphasis should be placed on converting appropriate former military air bases to civil use and identifying and improving additional joint-use facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) that the airport improvement program should be administered to encourage projects that employ innovative technology, concepts, and approaches that will promote safety, capacity, and efficiency improvements in the construction of airports and in the air transportation system (including the development and use of innovative concrete and other materials in the construction of airport facilities to minimize initial laydown costs, minimize time out of service, and maximize lifecycle durability) and to encourage and solicit innovative technology proposals and activities in the expenditure of funding pursuant to this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) that airport fees, rates, and charges must be reasonable and may only be used for purposes not prohibited by this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) that airports should be as self-sustaining as possible under the circumstances existing at each particular airport and in establishing new fees, rates, and charges, and generating revenues from all sources, airport owners and operators should not seek to create revenue surpluses that exceed the amounts to be used for airport system purposes and for other purposes for which airport revenues may be spent under section 47107(b)(1) of this title, including reasonable reserves and other funds to facilitate financing and cover contingencies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>National Transportation Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) It is a goal of the United States to develop a national intermodal transportation system that transports passengers and property in an efficient manner. The future economic direction of the United States depends on its ability to confront directly the enormous challenges of the global economy, declining productivity growth, energy vulnerability, air pollution, and the need to rebuild the infrastructure of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) United States leadership in the world economy, the expanding wealth of the United States, the competitiveness of the industry of the United States, the standard of living, and the quality of life are at stake.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A national intermodal transportation system is a coordinated, flexible network of diverse but complementary forms of transportation that transports passengers and property in the most efficient manner. By reducing transportation costs, these intermodal systems will enhance the ability of the industry of the United States to compete in the global marketplace.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) All forms of transportation, including aviation and other transportation systems of the future, will be full partners in the effort to reduce energy consumption and air pollution while promoting economic development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) An intermodal transportation system consists of transportation hubs that connect different forms of appropriate transportation and provides users with the most efficient means of transportation and with access to commercial centers, business locations, population centers, and the vast rural areas of the United States, as well as providing links to other forms of transportation and to intercity connections.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Intermodality and flexibility are paramount issues in the process of developing an integrated system that will obtain the optimum yield of United States resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The United States transportation infrastructure must be reshaped to provide the economic underpinnings for the United States to compete in the 21st century global economy. The United States can no longer rely on the sheer size of its economy to dominate international economic rivals and must recognize fully that its economy is no longer a separate entity but is part of the global marketplace. The future economic prosperity of the United States depends on its ability to compete in an international marketplace that is teeming with competitors but in which a full one-quarter of the <!-- PDFPage:688 -->economic activity of the United States takes place.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The United States must make a national commitment to rebuild its infrastructure through development of a national intermodal transportation system. The United States must provide the foundation for its industries to improve productivity and their ability to compete in the global economy with a system that will transport passengers and property in an efficient manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Capacity Expansion and Noise Abatement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is in the public interest to recognize the effects of airport capacity expansion projects on aircraft noise. Efforts to increase capacity through any means can have an impact on surrounding communities. Noncompatible land uses around airports must be reduced and efforts to mitigate noise must be given a high priority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Consistency With Air Commerce and Safety Policies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each airport and airway program should be carried out consistently with section 40101(a), (b), (d), and (f) of this title to foster competition, prevent unfair methods of competition in air transportation, maintain essential air transportation, and prevent unjust and discriminatory practices, including as the practices may be applied between categories and classes of aircraft.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Adequacy of Navigation Aids and Airport Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subchapter should be carried out to provide adequate navigation aids and airport facilities for places at which scheduled commercial air service is provided. The facilities provided may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) reliever airports; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) heliports designated by the Secretary of Transportation to relieve congestion at commercial service airports by diverting aircraft passengers from fixed-wing aircraft to helicopter carriers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Use of Safety Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subchapter should be carried out consistently with a comprehensive airspace system plan, giving highest priority to commercial service airports, to maximize the use of safety facilities, including installing, operating, and maintaining, to the extent possible with available money and considering other safety needs&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) electronic or visual vertical guidance on each runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) grooving or friction treatment of each primary and secondary runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) distance-to-go signs for each primary and secondary runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a precision approach system, a vertical visual guidance system, and a full approach light system for each primary runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a nonprecision instrument approach for each secondary runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) runway end identifier lights on each runway that does not have an approach light system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) a surface movement radar system at each category III airport;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) a taxiway lighting and sign system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) runway edge lighting and marking; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) radar approach coverage for each airport terminal area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Intermodal Planning</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To carry out the policy of subsection (a)(5) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall take each of the following actions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Coordination in development of airport plans and programs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Cooperate with State and local officials in developing airport plans and programs that are based on overall transportation needs. The airport plans and programs shall be developed in coordination with other transportation planning and considering comprehensive long-range land-use plans and overall social, economic, environmental, system performance, and energy conservation objectives. The process of developing airport plans and programs shall be continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive to the degree appropriate to the complexity of the transportation problems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Goals for airport master and system plans</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Encourage airport sponsors and State and local officials to develop airport master plans and airport system plans that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) foster effective coordination between aviation planning and metropolitan planning;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) include an evaluation of aviation needs within the context of multimodal planning; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) are integrated with metropolitan plans to ensure that airport development proposals include adequate consideration of land use and ground transportation access.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Representation of airport operators on mpo's</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Encourage metropolitan planning organizations, particularly in areas with populations greater than 200,000, to establish membership positions for airport operators.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To carry out the policy of subsection (a)(6) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall consult with the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency about any project included in a project grant application involving the location of an airport or runway, or a major runway extension, that may have a significant effect on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) natural resources, including fish and wildlife;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) natural, scenic, and recreation assets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) water and air quality; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) another factor affecting the environment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Submission and Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An application for a project grant under this subchapter may be submitted to the Secretary of Transportation by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a sponsor; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a State, as the only sponsor, for an airport development project benefitting 1 or more airports in the State or for airport planning for projects for 1 or more airports in the State if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the Secretary is satisfied there is administrative merit and aeronautical benefit in the State being the sponsor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) an acceptable agreement exists that ensures that the State will comply with appropriate grant conditions and other assurances the Secretary requires.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before deciding to undertake an airport development project at an airport under this subchapter, a sponsor shall consult with the airport users that will be affected by the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection does not authorize a public agency that is subject to the laws of a State to apply for a project grant in violation of a law of the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Contents and Form</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An application for a project grant under this subchapter&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>State Standards for Airport Development</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may approve standards (except standards for safety of approaches) that a State prescribes for airport development at nonprimary public-use airports in the State. On approval under this subsection, a State's standards apply to the nonprimary public-use airports in the State instead of the comparable standards prescribed by the Secretary under subsection (b)(3) of this section. The Secretary, or the State with the approval of the Secretary, may revise standards approved under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Certification of Compliance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may require a sponsor to certify that the sponsor will comply with this subchapter in carrying out the project.

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Preventive Maintenance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After January 1, 1995, the Secretary may approve an application under this subchapter for the replacement or reconstruction of pavement at an airport only if the sponsor has provided such assurances or certifications as the Secretary may determine appropriate that such airport has implemented an effective airport pavement maintenance-management program. The Secretary may require such reports on pavement condition and pavement management programs as the Secretary determines may be useful.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Notification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The sponsor of an airport for which an amount is apportioned under section 47114(c) of this title shall notify the Secretary of the fiscal year in which the sponsor intends to submit a project grant application for the apportioned amount.

However, the revenue resulting during a Hawaiian fiscal year may be used only if the amount of the revenue, plus amounts Hawaii receives in the fiscal year from all other sources for costs Hawaii incurs for operating all airports it operates and for debt service related to capital projects for the airports (including interest and amortization of principal costs), is more than 150 percent of the projected costs for the fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Revenue from sales referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection in a Hawaiian fiscal year that Hawaii may use may not be more than the amount that is greater than 150 percent as determined under paragraph (2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Hawaii shall determine costs, revenue, and projected revenue increases referred to in this subsection and shall submit the determinations to the Secretary of Transportation. A determination is approved unless the Secretary disapproves it not later than 30 days after it is submitted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Hawaii is not eligible for a grant under section 47115 of this title in a fiscal year in which Hawaii uses under paragraph (2) of this subsection revenue from sales referred to in paragraph (2).

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After making a project grant agreement under this subchapter and consulting with the sponsor, the Secretary of Transportation may decide when and in what amounts payments under the agreement will be made. Payments totaling not more than 90 percent of the United States Government's share of the project's estimated allowable costs may be made before the project is completed if the sponsor certifies to the Secretary that the total amount expended from the advance payments at any time will not be more than the cost of the airport development work completed on the project at that time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Recovering Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary determines that the total amount of payments made under a grant agreement under this subchapter is more than the Government's share of the total allowable project costs, the Government may recover the excess amount. If the Secretary finds that a project for which an advance payment was made has not been completed within a reasonable time, the Government may recover any part of the advance payment for which the Government received no benefit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Payment Deposits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A payment under a project grant agreement under this subchapter may be made only to an official or depository designated by the sponsor and authorized by law to receive public money.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Withholding Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may withhold a payment under a grant agreement under this subchapter for more than 180 days after the payment is due only if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notifies the sponsor and provides an opportunity for a hearing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) finds that the sponsor has violated the agreement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The 180-day period may be extended by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) agreement of the Secretary and the sponsor; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the hearing officer if the officer decides an extension is necessary because the sponsor did not follow the schedule the officer established.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A person adversely affected by an order of the Secretary withholding a payment may apply for review of the order by filing a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the project is located. The petition must be filed not later than 60 days after the order is served on the petitioner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Action on Grant Assurances Concerning Airport Revenues</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary finds a violation of section 47107(b) of this title, as further defined by the Secretary under section 47107(<em>l</em>) of this title, or a violation of an assurance made under section 47107(b) of this title, and the Secretary has provided an opportunity for the airport sponsor to take corrective action to cure such violation, and such corrective action has not been taken within the period of time set by the Secretary, the Secretary shall withhold approval of any new grant application for funds under this chapter, or any proposed modification to an existing grant that would increase the amount of funds made available under this chapter to the airport sponsor, and withhold approval of any new application to impose a fee under section 40117 of this title. Such applications may thereafter be approved only upon a finding by the Secretary that such corrective action as the Secretary requires has been taken to address the violation and that the violation no longer exists.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Judicial Enforcement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For any violation of this chapter or any grant assurance made under this chapter, the Secretary may apply to the district court of the United States for any district in which the violation occurred for enforcement. Such court shall have jurisdiction to enforce obedience thereto by a writ of injunction or other process, mandatory or otherwise, restraining any person from further violation.</p>

However, in apportioning amounts for a fiscal year under this subsection, the Secretary shall apportion&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for each primary airport at least as much as would be apportioned for the airport under subsection (c)(1) of this section; and</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;47115. Discretionary fund</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Existence and Amounts in Fund</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation has a discretionary fund. The fund consists of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) amounts subject to apportionment for a fiscal year that are not apportioned under section 47114(c)&ndash;(e) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 25 percent of amounts not apportioned under section 47114 of this title because of section 47114(f).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Availability of Amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to subsection (c) of this section and section 47117(e) of this title, the fund is available for making grants for any purpose for which amounts are made available under section 48103 of this title that the Secretary considers most appropriate to carry out this subchapter. However, 50 percent of amounts not apportioned under section 47114 of this title because of section 47114(f) and added to the fund is available for making grants for projects at small hub airports (as defined in section 41731 of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Minimum Percentage for Primary and Reliever Airports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At least 75 percent of the amount in the fund and distributed by the Secretary in a fiscal year shall be used for making grants&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to preserve and enhance capacity, safety, and security at primary and reliever airports; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to carry out airport noise compatibility planning and programs at primary and reliever airports.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In selecting a project for a grant to preserve and enhance capacity as described in subsection (c)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the effect the project will have on the overall national air transportation system capacity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the project benefit and cost, including, in the case of a project at a reliever airport, the number of operations projected to be diverted from a primary airport to the reliever airport as a result of the project, as well as the cost savings projected to be realized by users of the local airport system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the financial commitment from non-United States Government sources to preserve or enhance airport capacity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the airport improvement priorities of the States, and regional offices of the Administration, to the extent such priorities are not in conflict with paragraphs (1) and (2);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the projected growth in the number of passengers that will be using the airport at which the project will be carried out; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) any increase in the number of passenger boardings in the preceding 12-month period at the airport at which the project will be carried out, with priority consideration to be given to projects at airports at which the number of passenger boardings increased by at least 20 percent as compared to the number of passenger boardings in the 12-month period preceding such period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Waiving Percentage Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary decides the Secretary cannot comply with the percentage requirement of subsection (c) of this section in a fiscal year because there are insufficient qualified grant applications to meet that percentage, the amount the Secretary determines will not be distributed as required by subsection (c) is available for obligation during the fiscal year without regard to the requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Consideration of Diversion of Revenues in Awarding Discretionary Grants.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>General rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to paragraph (2), in deciding whether or not to distribute funds to an airport from the discretionary funds established by subsection (a) of this section and section 47116 of this title, the Secretary shall consider as a factor militating against the distribution of such funds to the airport the fact that the airport is using revenues generated by the airport or by local taxes on aviation fuel for purposes other than capital or operating costs of the airport or the local airports system or other local facilities which are owned or operated by the owner or operator of the airport and directly and substantially related to the actual air transportation of passengers or property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Required finding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Paragraph (1) shall apply only when the Secretary finds that the amount of revenues used by the airport for purposes other than capital or operating costs in the airport's fiscal year preceding the date of the application for discretionary funds exceeds the amount of such revenues in the airport's first fiscal year ending after August 23, 1994, adjusted by the Secretary for changes in the Consumer Price Index of All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Minimum Amount To Be Credited.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<!-- PDFPage:717 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>General rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In a fiscal year, there shall be credited to the fund, out of amounts made available under section 48103 of this title, an amount that is at least equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) $148,000,000; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the total amount required from the fund to carry out in the fiscal year letters of intent issued before January 1, 1996, under section 47110(e) of this title or the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The amount credited is exclusive of amounts that have been apportioned in a prior fiscal year under section 47114 of this title and that remain available for obligation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Reduction of apportionments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In a fiscal year in which the amount credited under subsection (a) is less than the minimum amount to be credited under paragraph (1), the total amount calculated under paragraph (3) shall be reduced by an amount that, when credited to the fund, together with the amount credited under subsection (a), equals such minimum amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Amount of reduction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For a fiscal year, the total amount available to make a reduction to carry out paragraph (2) is the total of the amounts determined under sections 47114(c)(1)(A), 47114(c)(2), 47114(d), and 47117(e) of this title. Each amount shall be reduced by an equal percentage to achieve the reduction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Special rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For a fiscal year in which the amount credited to the fund under this subsection exceeds $300,000,000, the Secretary shall allocate the amount of such excess as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 1/3 shall be made available to airports for which apportionments are made under section 47114(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 1/3 shall be made available for airport noise compatibility planning under section 47505(a)(2) of this title and for carrying out noise compatibility programs under section 47504(c)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) 1/3 shall be made available to current or former military airports for which grants may be made under section 47117(e)(1)(B) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Priority for Letters of Intent</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In making grants in a fiscal year with funds made available under this section, the Secretary shall fulfill intentions to obligate under section 47110(e).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Period of Availability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An amount apportioned under section 47114 of this title is available to be obligated for grants under the apportionment only during the fiscal year for which the amount was apportioned and the 2 fis<!-- PDFPage:719 -->cal years immediately after that year or the 3 fiscal years immediately following that year in the case of a primary airport that had less than .05 percent of the total boardings in the United States in the preceding calendar year. If the amount is not obligated under the apportionment within that time, it shall be added to the discretionary fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Primary Airports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An amount apportioned to a sponsor of a primary airport under section 47114(c)(1) of this title is available for grants for any public-use airport of the sponsor included in the national plan of integrated airport systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A sponsor of a primary airport may make an agreement with the Secretary of Transportation waiving any part of the amount apportioned for the airport under section 47114(c)(1) of this title if the Secretary makes the waived amount available for a grant for another public-use airport in the same State or geographical area as the primary airport.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>State Use</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An amount apportioned to a State under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) section 47114(d)(2)(A) of this title is available for grants for airports located in the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) section 47114(d)(2)(B) or (C) of this title is available for grants for airports described in section 47114(d)(2)(B) or (C) and located in the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Special Apportionment Categories</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall use amounts available to the discretionary fund under section 47115 of this title for each fiscal year as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) At least 31 percent for grants for airport noise compatibility planning under section 47505(a)(2) of this title and for carrying out noise compatibility programs under section 47504(c) of this title. The Secretary may count the amount of grants made for such planning and programs with funds apportioned under section 47114 in that fiscal year in determining whether or not such 31 percent requirement is being met in that fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) At least 4 percent for each fiscal year thereafter to sponsors of current or former military airports designated by the Secretary under section 47118(a) of this title for grants for developing current and former military airports to improve the capacity of the national air transportation system and to sponsors of noncommercial service airports for grants for operational and maintenance expenses at any such airport if the amount of such grants to the sponsor of the airport does not exceed $30,000 in that fiscal year, if the Secretary determines that the airport is adversely affected by the closure or realignment of a military base, and if the sponsor of the airport certifies that the airport would otherwise close if the airport does not receive the grant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary decides that an amount required to be used for grants under paragraph (1) of this subsection cannot be used for a fiscal year because there are insufficient qualified grant applications, the amount the Secretary determines cannot be used is available during the fiscal year for grants for other airports or for other purposes for which amounts are authorized for grants under section 48103 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Limitation for Commercial Service Airport in Alaska</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not make a grant for a commercial service airport in Alaska of more than 110 percent of the amount apportioned for the airport for a fiscal year under section 47114(e) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Discretionary Use of Apportionments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, if the Secretary finds, based on the notices the Secretary receives under section 47105(f) of this title or otherwise, that an amount apportioned under section 47114 of this title will not be used for grants during a fiscal year, the Secretary may use an equal amount for grants during that fiscal year for any of the purposes for which amounts are authorized for grants under section 48103 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may make a grant under paragraph (1) of this subsection only if the Secretary decides that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the total amount used for grants for the fiscal year under section 48103 of this title will not be more than the amount made available under section 48103 for that fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amounts authorized for grants under section 48103 of this title for later fiscal years are sufficient for grants of the apportioned amounts that were not used for grants under the apportionment during the fiscal year and that remain available under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Limiting Authority of Secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority of the Secretary to make grants during a fiscal year from amounts that were apportioned for a prior fiscal year and remain available for approved airport development project grants under subsection (b) of this section may be impaired only by a law enacted after September 3, 1982, that expressly limits that authority.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Request Secretary's Determination.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall issue a determination as to whether a fee imposed upon one or more air carriers (as defined in section 40102 of this title) by the owner or operator of an airport is reasonable if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a written request for such determination is filed with the Secretary by such owner or operator; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a written complaint requesting such determination is filed with the Secretary by an affected air carrier within 60 days after such carrier receives written notice of the establishment or increase of such fee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Calculation of fee</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A fee subject to a determination of reasonableness under this section may be calculated pursuant to either a compensatory or residual fee methodology or any combination thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Secretary not to set fee</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining whether a fee is reasonable under this section, the Secretary may only determine whether the fee is reasonable or unreasonable and shall not set the level of the fee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Fees imposed by privately-owned airports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In evaluating the reasonableness of a fee imposed by an airport receiving an exemption under section 47134 of this title, the Secretary shall consider whether the airport has complied with section 47134(c)(4).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Procedural Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 90 days after August 23, 1994, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register final regulations, policy statements, or guidelines establishing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the procedures for acting upon any written request or complaint filed under subsection (a)(1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the standards or guidelines that shall be used by the Secretary in determining under this section whether an airport fee is reasonable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Decisions By Secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The final regulations, policy statements, or guidelines required in subsection (b) shall provide the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Not more than 120 days after an air carrier files with the Secretary a written complaint relating to an airport fee, the Secretary shall issue a final order determining whether such fee is reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Within 30 days after such complaint is filed with the Secretary, the Secretary shall dismiss the complaint if no significant dispute exists or shall assign the matter to an administrative law judge; and thereafter the matter shall be handled in accordance with part 302 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, or as modified by the Secretary to ensure an orderly disposition of the matter within the 120-day period and any specifically applicable provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The administrative law judge shall issue a recommended decision within 60 days after the complaint is assigned or within such shorter period as the Secretary may specify.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If the Secretary, upon the expiration of 120 days after the filing of the complaint, has not issued a final order, the decision of the administrative law judge shall be deemed to be the final order of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Any party to the dispute may seek review of a final order of the Secretary under this subsection in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or the court of appeals in the circuit where the airport which gives rise to the written complaint is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Any findings of fact in a final order of the Secretary under this subsection, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive if challenged in a court pursuant to this subsection. No objection to such a final order shall be considered by the court unless objection was urged before an administrative law judge or the Secretary at a proceeding under this subsection or, if not so urged, unless there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Payment Under Protest; Guarantee of Air Carrier Access.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Payment under protest.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any fee increase or newly established fee which is the subject of a complaint that is not dismissed by the Secretary shall be paid by the complainant air carrier to the airport under protest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Referral or credit</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any amounts paid under this subsection by a complainant air carrier to the airport under protest shall be subject to refund or credit to the air carrier in accordance with directions in the final order of the Secretary within 30 days of such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Assurance of timely repayment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In order to assure the timely repayment, with interest, of amounts in dispute determined not to be reasonable by the Secretary, the airport shall obtain a letter of credit, or surety bond, or other suitable credit facility, equal to the amount in dispute that is due during the 120-day period established by this section, plus interest, unless the airport and the complainant air carrier agree otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Deadline</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The letter of credit, or surety bond, or other suitable credit facility shall be provided to the Secretary within 20 days of the filing of the complaint and shall remain in effect for 30 days after the earlier of 120 days or the issuance of a timely final order by the Secretary determining whether such fee is reasonable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Guarantee of air carrier access</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Contingent upon an air carrier's compliance with the requirements of paragraph (1) and pending <!-- PDFPage:729 -->the issuance of a final order by the Secretary determining the reasonableness of a fee that is the subject of a complaint filed under subsection (a)(1)(B), an owner or operator of an airport may not deny an air carrier currently providing air service at the airport reasonable access to airport facilities or service, or otherwise interfere with an air carrier's prices, routes, or services, as a means of enforcing the fee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Applicability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section does not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a fee imposed pursuant to a written agreement with air carriers using the facilities of an airport;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Effect On Existing Agreements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section shall adversely affect&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the rights of any party under any existing written agreement between an air carrier and the owner or operator of an airport; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the ability of an airport to meet its obligations under a financing agreement, or covenant, that is in force as of August 23, 1994.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;fee&rdquo; means any rate, rental charge, landing fee, or other service charge for the use of airport facilities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) aviation noise management is crucial to the continued increase in airport capacity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) community noise concerns have led to uncoordinated and inconsistent restrictions on aviation that could impede the national air transportation system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a noise policy must be carried out at the national level;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) local interest in aviation noise management shall be considered in determining the national interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) community concerns can be alleviated through the use of new technology aircraft and the use of revenues, including those available from passenger facility fees, for noise management;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) revenues controlled by the United States Government can help resolve noise problems and carry with them a responsibility to the national airport system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) revenues derived from a passenger facility fee may be applied to noise management and increased airport capacity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) a precondition to the establishment and collection of a passenger facility fee is the prescribing by the Secretary of Transportation of a regulation establishing procedures for reviewing airport noise and access restrictions on operations of stage 2 and stage 3 aircraft.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The national aviation noise policy established under section 47523 of this title shall provide for establishing by regulation a national program for reviewing airport noise and access restrictions on the operation of stage 2 and stage 3 aircraft. The program shall provide for adequate public notice <!-- PDFPage:744 -->and opportunity for comment on the restrictions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Stage</cap-smallcap> 2 <cap-smallcap>Aircraft</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, an airport noise or access restriction may include a restriction on the operation of stage 2 aircraft proposed after October 1, 1990, only if the airport operator publishes the proposed restriction and prepares and makes available for public comment at least 180 days before the effective date of the proposed restriction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an analysis of the anticipated or actual costs and benefits of the existing or proposed restriction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a description of alternative restrictions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a description of the alternative measures considered that do not involve aircraft restrictions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a comparison of the costs and benefits of the alternative measures to the costs and benefits of the proposed restriction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Stage</cap-smallcap> 3 <cap-smallcap>Aircraft</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, an airport noise or access restriction on the operation of stage 3 aircraft not in effect on October 1, 1990, may become effective only if the restriction has been agreed to by the airport proprietor and all aircraft operators or has been submitted to and approved by the Secretary of Transportation after an airport or aircraft operator's request for approval as provided by the program established under this section. Restrictions to which this paragraph applies include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a restriction on noise levels generated on either a single event or cumulative basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a restriction on the total number of stage 3 aircraft operations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a noise budget or noise allocation program that would include stage 3 aircraft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a restriction on hours of operations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) any other restriction on stage 3 aircraft.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 180 days after the Secretary receives an airport or aircraft operator's request for approval of an airport noise or access restriction on the operation of a stage 3 aircraft, the Secretary shall approve or disapprove the restriction. The Secretary may approve the restriction only if the Secretary finds on the basis of substantial evidence that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the restriction is reasonable, nonarbitrary, and nondiscriminatory;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the restriction does not create an unreasonable burden on interstate or foreign commerce;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the restriction is not inconsistent with maintaining the safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the restriction does not conflict with a law or regulation of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) an adequate opportunity has been provided for public comment on the restriction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the restriction does not create an unreasonable burden on the national aviation system.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection do not apply if the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, before November 5, 1990, has formed a working group (outside the process established by part 150 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations) with a local airport operator to examine the noise impact of air traffic control procedure changes at the airport. However, if an agreement on noise reductions at that airport is made between the airport proprietor and one or more air carriers or foreign air carriers that constitute a majority of the carrier use of the airport, this paragraph applies only to a local action to enforce the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may reevaluate an airport noise or access restriction previously agreed to or approved under this subsection on request of an aircraft operator able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that there has been a change in the noise environment of the affected airport that justifies a reevaluation. The Secretary shall establish by regulation procedures for conducting a reevaluation. A reevaluation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall be based on the criteria in paragraph (2) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may be conducted only after 2 years after a decision under paragraph (2) of this subsection has been made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Nonapplication</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subsections (b) and (c) of this section do not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a local action to enforce a negotiated or executed airport noise or access agreement between the airport operator and the aircraft operators in effect on November 5, 1990;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a local action to enforce a negotiated or executed airport noise or access restriction agreed to by the airport operator and the aircraft operators before November 5, 1990;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an intergovernmental agreement including an airport noise or access restriction in effect on November 5, 1990;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a subsequent amendment to an airport noise or access agreement or restriction in effect on November 5, 1990, that does not reduce or limit aircraft operations or affect aircraft safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5)(A) an airport noise or access restriction adopted by an airport operator not later than October 1, 1990, and stayed as of October 1, 1990, by a court order or as a result of litigation, if any part of the restriction is subsequently allowed by a court to take effect; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a new restriction imposed by an airport operator to replace any part of a restriction described in subclause (A) of this clause that is disallowed by a court, if the new restriction would not prohibit aircraft operations in effect on November 5, 1990; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) a local action that represents the adoption of the final part of a program of a staged airport noise or access restriction if the initial part of the program was adopted during 1988 and was in effect on November 5, 1990.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Grant Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Beginning on the 91st day after the Secretary prescribes a regulation under subsection (a) of this section, a sponsor of a facility operating under an airport noise or access restriction on the operation of stage 3 aircraft that first became effective after October 1, 1990, is eligible for a grant under section 47104 of this title and is eligible to impose a passenger facility fee under section 40117 of this title only if the restriction has been&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) agreed to by the airport proprietor and aircraft operators;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an analysis of the impact of aircraft noise on individuals residing near airports.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Annual Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Beginning with calendar year 1992&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) each air carrier shall submit to the Secretary an annual report on the progress the carrier is making toward complying with the requirements of this section and regulations prescribed under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary shall submit to Congress an annual report on the progress being made toward that compliance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Hawaiian Operations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;turnaround service&rdquo; means a flight between places only in Hawaii.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) An air carrier or foreign air carrier may not operate in Hawaii, or between a place in Hawaii and a place outside the 48 contiguous States, a greater number of stage 2 aircraft with a maximum weight of more than 75,000 pounds than it operated in Hawaii, or between a place in Hawaii and a place outside the 48 contiguous States, on November 5, 1990.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An air carrier that provided turnaround service in Hawaii on November 5, 1990, using stage 2 aircraft with a maximum weight of more than 75,000 pounds may include in the number of aircraft authorized under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph all stage 2 aircraft with a maximum weight of more than 75,000 pounds that were owned or leased by that carrier on that date, whether or not the aircraft were operated by the carrier on that date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An air carrier may provide turnaround service in Hawaii using stage 2 aircraft with a maximum weight of more than 75,000 pounds only if the carrier provided the service on November 5, 1990.</p>
