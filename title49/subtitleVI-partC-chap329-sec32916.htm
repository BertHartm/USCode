<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;a report on the review by the Secretary&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;a review&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;beginning in 1977&rdquo; and the text of 15:2002(a) (2d, last sentences) are omitted as executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), before clause (A), reference to section 32904(b)(4) the 2d time it appears is substituted for &ldquo;the amendment made to section 2003(b) of this title by section 4(a)(1) of the Automobile Fuel Efficiency Act of 1980&rdquo; for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. Clause (B) is substituted for &ldquo;achieves the purposes of that Act&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the reference to &ldquo;subsection (a) of this section&rdquo; is restated to refer to 15:2002(a) rather than 15:2012(a) to reflect the apparent intent of Congress. Although 15:2012(c)(2) refers to an annual report under 15:2012(a), that provision does not provide for an annual report.</p>
