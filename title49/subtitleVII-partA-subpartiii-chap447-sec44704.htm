<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Production Certificates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall issue a production certificate authorizing the production of a duplicate of an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance for which a type certificate has been issued when the Administrator finds the duplicate will conform to the certificate. On receiving an application, the Administrator shall inspect, and may require testing of, a duplicate to ensure that it conforms to the requirements of the certificate. The Administrator may include in a production certificate terms required in the interest of safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Airworthiness Certificates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The registered owner of an aircraft may apply to the Administrator for an airworthiness certificate for the aircraft.

The Administrator shall register each airworthiness certificate and may include appropriate information in the certificate. The certificate number or other individual designation the Administrator requires shall be displayed on the aircraft. The Administrator may include in an airworthiness certificate terms required in the interest of safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A person applying for the issuance or renewal of an airworthiness certificate for an aircraft for which ownership has not been recorded under section 44107 or 44110  of this title must submit with the application information related to the ownership of the aircraft the Administrator decides is necessary to identify each person having a property interest in the aircraft and the kind and extent of the interest.</p>
