<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) When a person delivers property to a rail carrier for transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, the person may direct the carrier to transport the property over an established through route. When competing rail lines constitute a part of the route, the person shipping the property may <!-- PDFPage:275 -->designate the lines over which the property will be transported. The designation must be in writing. A carrier may be directed to transport property over a particular through route when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there are at least 2 through routes over which the property could be transported;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a through rate has been established for transportation over each of those through routes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the carrier is a party to those routes and rates.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A carrier directed to route property transported under paragraph (1) of this subsection must issue a through bill of lading containing the routing instructions and transport the property according to the instructions. When the property is delivered to a connecting carrier, that carrier must also receive and transport it according to the routing instructions and deliver it to the next succeeding carrier or consignee according to the instructions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If no direction is made under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission may designate the route over which the property may be transported after arrival at the end of the route of one carrier or at a junction with the route of another carrier when the property is to be delivered to another carrier for further transportation. The Commission may act under this subsection when the public interest and a fair distribution of traffic require that action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission may prescribe exceptions to the authority of a person to direct the movement of traffic under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
