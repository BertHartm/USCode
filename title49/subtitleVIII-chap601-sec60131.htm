<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall review the qualification program of each pipeline operator and verify its compliance with the standards and criteria described in subsection (b) and that it includes the elements described in subsection (d). The Secretary shall record the results of that review for use in the next review of an operator's program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Deadline for completion</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Reviews and verifications under this subsection shall be completed not later than 3 years after the date of the enactment of this section.</p>
