<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the enumerated laws are substituted for &ldquo;through financial assistance under this Act&rdquo;, meaning the Rail Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (Pub. L. 94&ndash;210, 90 Stat. 31) and laws amended by that Act. The laws cited in the subsection are substituted for &ldquo;through financial assistance under this Act&rdquo; for clarity. The enumerated laws include provisions of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 that amend other laws as well as provisions that are not amendments to other laws. A reference to the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 (Pub. L. 88&ndash;365, 78 Stat. 302) is omitted because this section related to that Act is superseded by 49:1615.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the word &ldquo;decides&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;determines&rdquo; for consistency. The word &ldquo;ensure&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;assure&rdquo; as being more precise.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretaries of Commerce, Energy, and Defense, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Public Works, and the heads of other interested agencies, shall lead and coordinate Federal efforts in the research and development of high-speed ground transportation technologies in order to foster the implementation of magnetic levitation and high-speed steel wheel on rail transportation systems as alternatives to existing transportation systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary may award contracts and grants for demonstrations to determine the contributions that high-speed ground transportation could make to more efficient, safe, and economical intercity transportation systems. Such demonstrations shall be designed to measure and evaluate such factors as the public response to new equipment, higher speeds, variations in fares, improved comfort and convenience, and more frequent service. In connection <!-- PDFPage:59 -->with grants and contracts for demonstrations under this section, the Secretary shall provide for financial participation by private industry to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In connection with the authority provided under paragraph (1), there is established a national high-speed ground transportation technology demonstration program, which shall be separate from the national magnetic levitation prototype development program established under section 1036(b) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 and shall be managed by the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Any eligible applicant may submit to the Secretary a proposal for demonstration of any advancement in a high-speed ground transportation technology or technologies to be incorporated as a component, subsystem, or system in any revenue service high-speed ground transportation project or system under construction or in operation at the time the application is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Grants or contracts shall be awarded only to eligible applicants showing demonstrable benefit to the research and development, design, construction, or ultimate operation of any maglev technology or high-speed steel wheel on rail technology. Criteria to be considered in evaluating the suitability of a proposal under this paragraph shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) feasibility of guideway or track design and construction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) safety and reliability;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) impact on the environment in comparison to other high-speed ground transportation technologies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) minimization of land use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(V) effect on human factors related to high-speed ground transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(VI) energy and power consumption and cost;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(VII) integration of high-speed ground transportation systems with other modes of transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(VIII) actual and projected ridership; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IX) design of signaling, communications, and control systems.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For the purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;eligible applicant&rdquo; means any United States private business, State government, local government, organization of State or local government, or any combination thereof. The term does not include any business owned in whole or in part by the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The amount and distribution of grants or contracts made under this paragraph shall be determined by the Secretary. No grant or contract may be awarded under this paragraph to demonstrate a technology to be incorporated into a project or system located in a State that prohibits under State law the expenditure of non-Federal public funds or revenues on the construction or operation of such project or system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Recipients of grants or contracts made pursuant to this paragraph shall agree to submit a report to the Secretary detailing the results and benefits of the technology demonstration proposed, as required by the Secretary.</p>
