<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Action of the Commission under subsection (a) of this section may not remain in effect for more than 60 days. However, the Commission may extend that period for an additional designated period of not more than 180 days if cause exists.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may not take action that would&mdash;</p>

The carrier must submit a current record of those total expenses to the Commission. The Commission shall certify promptly, to the Secretary of the Treasury, the amount to be paid. The Secretary shall pay that amount by the 90th day after the end of the period during which the direction of the Commission is effective, and funds are authorized to be appropriated for that payment.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title shall make a reasonable distribution of cars for transportation of coal among the coal mines served by it whether the mines are located on its line or are customarily dependent on it for car supply. If the supply of available cars does not equal the requirements of the mines, the carrier shall maintain and apply reasonable ratings of the mines and count each car furnished to or used by a mine for transportation of coal against that mine. However, coal cars supplied by shippers or receivers are deemed not to be a part of the carrier's fleet and are not counted in determining a question about distribution or car count under subsection (b) of this section or section 10102, 10501, 10701&ndash;10703, 10707, 10721(b), 10722(c)&ndash;(d), 10723(a)&ndash;(b)(1), 10724(a), 10741&ndash;10744, 10746, 10749, 10750, 10901, 10902, 10907, 11101, 11103&ndash;11105, 11121&ndash;11125, 11127, 11128(a)(1), 11501(f), 11505(a), 11702(a)(1), 11703, 11901(d)&ndash;(e)(2), 11902, 11903, 11905, 11907, 11915, or 11916 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;unit-train service&rdquo; means the movement of a single shipment of coal of at least 4,500 tons, tendered to one carrier, on one bill of lading, at one origin, on one day, and destined to one consignee, at one plant, at one destination, over one route.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Unit-train service and non-unit-train service are deemed to be separate and distinct classes of service. A distinction shall be made between them and between the cars used in each class of service. A question about the reasonableness of, or discrimination in, the distribution of cars shall be determined within each class and not between them, notwithstanding a section referred to in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
