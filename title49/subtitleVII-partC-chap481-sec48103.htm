<p class="note-body">In this section, references to the aggregate amounts for fiscal years ending before October 1, 1987&ndash;1992, are omitted as obsolete. The words &ldquo;of which $475,000,000 shall be credited to the supplementary discretionary fund established by section 2206(a)(3)(B)&rdquo; are omitted as executed. In restating section 505(a) (2d sentence) of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (Public Law 97&ndash;248, 96 Stat. 676), the cross-reference to the discretionary fund was retained but is incorrect because of the restatement of section 507 of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (Public Law 97&ndash;248, 96 Stat. 679) by section 426(a) of the Highway Improvement Act of 1982 (Public Law 97&ndash;424, 96 Stat. 2167).
