<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission to act under this subchapter is exclusive. The Commission may approve and authorize a carrier, as defined in section 11301(a)(1) of this title, to change (1) a part of a class of its securities, as defined in section 11301(a)(2) of this title, or (2) a part of an instrument under which a class of its securities is issued or a class of its obligations is secured. When a change is approved and authorized by the Commission under this subchapter, the carrier may carry out the change notwithstanding an express provision in the affected instrument or a State law and without getting other approval from the Commission or from a State authority. A person participating in carrying out a change that is approved and authorized under this subchapter is exempt from all other law, including State and municipal law, as necessary to let that person carry out the change.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may not approve an application filed under this section by a carrier that is in equity receivership or reorganization under subchapter IV of chapter 11 of title 11.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A power granted to a carrier under this subchapter changes its powers under its corporate charter and under State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) This subchapter does not affect the negotiability of a security of a carrier or of the obligation of a carrier that assumed liability related to a security. This subchapter does not apply to an equipment-trust certificate under which a carrier is obligated, to an evidence of indebtedness of a carrier the payment of which is secured solely by equipment, or to another instrument under which that equipment-trust certificate or evidence of indebtedness was issued or by which either of them is secured.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;11362. Criteria for approval and authority</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A carrier may apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission for approval and authority to make a change under this subchapter. To approve a proposed change, the Commission must find that the proposed change&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is within the scope of section 11361 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will be in the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) will be in the best interests of the carrier, of each class of its stockholders, and of the holders of each class of the carrier's obligations that are affected by the change; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) will not be against the interests of a creditor of the carrier who is not affected by the change.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the change involves an issuance of securities, the Commission must also make the findings required under section 11301(d)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Commission shall begin a proceeding under this section on receipt of an application but may require an applicant to get assurances of assent to the change from the holders of the outstanding shares of the securities that will be affected by the change before continuing with the proceeding. The Commission may determine the percentage of the principal amount or number of those shares needed to establish assurance of assent to the change. A class of securities is considered to be affected by a proposed change only if the change is proposed to a part of that class or to a part of an instrument under which that class was issued or by which it is secured. However, if a proposed change is to an instrument under which at least 2 classes of securities were issued and are outstanding or secured by that instrument, only those classes to which the change is related are considered to be affected. The Commission shall divide the securities to be affected by a proposed change under this subchapter into reasonable classes for purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) On receipt of an application of a carrier under this section the Commission shall notify, and file a copy of the application with, the chief executive officer of each State in which that carrier operates. The appropriate authorities of those States are entitled to be admitted as parties to a proceeding under this section to represent the rights and interests of their people and States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The carrier must give notice of the proceeding to the holders of the class of securities affected. The Commission may direct the carrier to give notice to other persons the Commission determines to have an interest in the proceeding. The carrier may give notice under this subsection only after it gets assurances of assent when they are required under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Commission may impose conditions governing the proposed change. The Commission may determine the effective date for a change it approves and authorizes under this subchapter and may allow it to become effective on publication of a declaration to that effect by the carrier. After an application is approved, the Commission may change a condition imposed and impose supplemental requirements for good cause shown subject to the requirements of this subchapter.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;11363. Assent of holders of securities and certain other instruments</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) After making the findings required under section 11362(a) of this title, the Commission may approve and authorize the change if it is assented to by the holders of at least 75 percent of the aggregate principal amount or number of outstanding shares of each class of securities affected by the change. The Commission may increase the percentage required for assent under this subsection for a class of shares when an increase is in the public interest and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 75 percent of the shares in that class are held by less than 25 security holders; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that class is entitled to vote for the election of directors of the carrier and the Commission determines that the assent of at least 25 percent of the security holders of that class are controlled by the carrier or a person controlling the carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The carrier may withdraw its application after the Commission makes the findings required under section 11362(a) of this title. If the application is not withdrawn, the Commission must require the carrier to submit the proposed change, with conditions imposed by the Commission, to the holders of each class of its securities affected by the change for their assent or rejection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In determining the percentage of outstanding securities when making a finding under section 11362(a) of this title, a security that secures an evidence of indebtedness of the carrier or of a company controlling or controlled by the carrier is considered to be outstanding unless the Commission determines that the proposed change does not materially affect the interest of the holder of that evidence of indebtedness. When that security is considered to be outstanding, assent to a proposed change may be given, notwithstanding another instrument, only&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if the security is pledged as security under an instrument under which an evidence of indebtedness was issued and is outstanding, by the holder of a majority of the principal amount of the evidence of indebtedness; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the security secures an evidence of indebtedness not issued under an instrument under which an evidence of indebtedness was issued, by the holder of the evidence of indebtedness.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to a submission required under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission shall require the carrier to submit a proposed change to a security referred to in this subsection, with requirements imposed by the Commission, to the holder of the evidence of indebtedness referred to in paragraph (1)(A) and (B) of this subsection as appropriate, for assent or rejection. A carrier is not required to submit the change to the trustee of the instrument referred to in that paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If the Commission determines that the assent of the holder of a security not entitled to vote for the election of directors of the carrier or an evidence of indebtedness is in the control of the carrier or of a person controlling the carrier, that security or evidence of indebtedness is not considered to be outstanding.</p>
