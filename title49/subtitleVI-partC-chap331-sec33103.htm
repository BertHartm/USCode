<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than October 25, 1994, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe a vehicle theft standard that conforms to the requirements of this chapter for covered major parts that manufacturers install in passenger motor vehicles (except light duty trucks) in not more than 50 percent of the lines not designated under section 33104 of this title as high theft lines.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Extension of Application</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than 3 years after the standard is prescribed under subsection (a) of this section and based on the finding of the Attorney General under subsection (c) of this section to apply the standard, the Secretary shall apply that standard to covered major parts and major replacement parts for covered parts that manufacturers install in the lines of passenger motor vehicles (except light duty trucks)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) not designated under section 33104 of this title as high theft lines; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) not covered by the standard prescribed under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall include as part of the regulatory proceeding under this subsection the finding of, and the record developed by, the Attorney General under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Initial Review of Effectiveness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before the Secretary begins a regulatory proceeding <!-- PDFPage:701 -->under subsection (b) of this section, the Attorney General shall make a finding that the Secretary shall apply the standard prescribed under subsection (a) of this section unless the Attorney General finds, based on information collected and analyzed under section 33112 of this title and other information the Attorney General develops after providing notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, that applying the standard prescribed in subsection (a) to the remaining lines of passenger motor vehicles (except light duty trucks) not covered by that standard would not substantially inhibit chop shop operations and motor vehicle thefts. The Attorney General also shall consider and include in the record additional costs, effectiveness, competition, and available alternative factors. The Attorney General shall submit to the Secretary the finding and record on which the finding is based.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Long Range Review of Effectiveness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than December 31, 1999, the Attorney General shall make separate findings, after notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, on the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) whether the application of the standard under subsection (a) or (b) of this subsection, or both, have been effective in substantially inhibiting the operation of chop shops and motor vehicle theft.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) whether the anti-theft devices for which the Secretary has granted exemptions under section 33106 of this title are an effective substitute for parts marking in substantially inhibiting motor vehicle theft.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In making the finding under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection, the Attorney General shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) consider the additional cost, competition, and available alternatives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) base that finding on information collected and analyzed under section 33112 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) consider the effectiveness, the extent of use, and the extent to which civil and criminal penalties under section 33115(b) of this title and section 2322 of title 18 on chop shops have been effective in substantially inhibiting operation of chop shops and motor vehicle theft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) base that finding on the 3-year and 5-year reports issued by the Secretary under section 33113 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) base that finding on other information the Attorney General develops and includes in the public record.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Attorney General shall submit a finding under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection promptly to the Secretary. If the Attorney General finds that the application of the standard under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, or both, has not been effective, the Secretary shall issue, not later than 180 days after receiving that finding, an order terminating the standard the Attorney General found was ineffective. The termination is effective for the model year beginning after the order is issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In making a finding under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the Secretary shall consider the additional cost, competition, and available alternatives. If the Attorney General finds that the anti-theft devices are an effective substitute, the Secretary shall continue to grant exemptions under section 33106 of this title for the model years after model year 2000 at one of the following levels that the Attorney General decides: at the level authorized before October 25, 1992, or at the level provided in section 33106(b)(2)(C) of this title for model year 2000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Effective Date of Standard</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A standard prescribed under this section takes effect at least 6 months after the date the standard is prescribed, except that the Secretary may prescribe an earlier effective date if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) decides with good cause that the earlier date is in the public interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) publishes the reasons for the decision.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Notification of Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary and the Attorney General shall inform the appropriate legislative committees of Congress with jurisdiction over this part and section 2322 of title 18 of actions taken or planned under this section.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1), the words &ldquo;to apply the standard&rdquo; are added for clarity. The words &ldquo;shall apply that standard to covered major parts and major replacement parts for covered parts that manufacturers install in the lines of passenger motor vehicles (except light duty trucks) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not designated under section 33104 of this title as high theft lines; and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not covered by the standard prescribed under subsection (a) of this section&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the Secretary .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall designate all the remaining such lines of such passenger motor vehicles (other than light-duty trucks) and apply such standard to such lines in conformance with the requirements of this subchapter&rdquo; for clarity and because of the restatement.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;The Secretary shall include as part of the regulatory proceeding under this subsection .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. developed by the Attorney General under subsection (c) of this section&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall be a part of the Secretary's rulemaking record&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;Before the Secretary begins a regulatory proceeding under subsection (b) of this section&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;prior to the Secretary's initiation and promulgation of a rule&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;applying the standard prescribed in subsection (a) to the remaining lines of passenger motor vehicles (except light duty trucks) not covered by that standard&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;requiring such <!-- PDFPage:702 -->additional parts marking for all of the applicable passenger motor vehicles&rdquo; for clarity and because of the restatement.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d)(1)(A), the words &ldquo;whether the application of the standard under subsection (a) or (b) of this subsection, or both&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;whether one or both rules promulgated under this subsection&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d)(2)(A)(iii), the words &ldquo;civil .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. penalties under section 33115(b) of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;civil .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. penalties under section 2027(b) of this title&rdquo; to correct an erroneous cross-reference.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d)(3), the words &ldquo;for the model years after model year 2000&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Nothing in this paragraph affects exemptions granted in model year 2000 or earlier to any manufacturer&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;at one of the following levels that the Attorney General decides&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;as determined by the Attorney General&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the text of 15:2022(c)(4) (related to the standard under 15:2022(c)(1)) is omitted as obsolete because the standard under 15:2022(c)(1) has already been prescribed. See 49 C.F.R. 541.</p>
