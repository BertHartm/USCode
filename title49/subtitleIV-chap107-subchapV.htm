<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10785. Finality of valuation: notice, protest, and review</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission shall notify the carrier, the Attorney General, and the chief executive officer of each State in which property being valued under this subchapter is located, of the completion of a tentative valuation of that property. The Commission may also notify other parties. The notice must be sent by certified mail and must indicate the valuation established for each of that carrier's classes of property. A valuation of property under this subchapter becomes final if a protest is not filed within 30 days after notice of the tentative valuation of that property is given. When the tentative valuation becomes final under this subsection, the effective date is the date of the tentative valuation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When a carrier files a protest of a tentative valuation, the Commission shall begin a proceeding to consider the protest. If the Commission decides that a tentative valuation should be changed, it may make the necessary changes. The tentative valuation, as changed, becomes final and is effective on the date of the final action of the Commission under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission shall publish final valuations and classifications of property established under this subchapter. A final valuation or classification that has become effective under this subchapter is prima facie evidence of the value of the property in a proceeding under this subtitle and in a judicial proceeding to enforce, enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend an action of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When evidence is introduced at the trial of an action involving a final valuation of property established by the Commission and found by the court to be different from the evidence offered to the Commission during a proceeding under subsection (b) of this section or in addition to that evidence and substantially affecting the valuation, the court shall send a copy of that evidence to the Commission and stay further proceedings in the action. The court may determine the duration of the stay of proceedings. The Commission shall consider the evidence and may change the final valuation established under this subchapter. The Commission shall complete its action and report to the court in the time determined by the court. If the Commission changes the valuation, the court must substitute the valuation as changed for the original valuation and give its judgment on the substituted valuation. If the Commission does <!-- PDFPage:282 -->not change the original valuation, the court must give judgment on the original valuation.</p>
