<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) When, under section 553(e) of title 5, an interested person (including a governmental authority) petitions the Interstate Commerce Commission to begin a rulemaking proceeding in a matter related to a rail carrier providing transportation subject to this subtitle, the Commission, or a division, an individual Commissioner, an employee board, an employee delegated to act under section 10305 of this title, or another person authorized to act on behalf of the Commission for any part of the proceeding, shall grant or deny that petition by the 120th day after receiving it. If the petition is granted, the Commission, or its delegate, shall begin an <!-- PDFPage:184 -->appropriate proceeding as soon as practicable. If the petition is denied, the reasons for the denial shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) If a petition is denied or action is not taken within the 120-day period under subsection (a) of this section, the petitioner may begin a civil action in an appropriate court of appeals of the United States for an order directing the Commission to begin a proceeding to take the action requested in the petition. A civil action under this subsection must be filed by the 60th day after the date of the denial or by the 60th day after the end of the 120-day period, whichever is appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The court of appeals shall order the Commission to begin the action requested in the petition to the Commission if the court finds that the action requested in that petition is necessary and failure to take that action will result in the continuation of practices that are not consistent with the public interest or are not in accordance with this subtitle. The finding of the court must be based on a preponderance of the evidence in the record before the Commission or its delegate, or, if the civil action is based on a petition on which action was not taken, in a new proceeding before the court. The court may not require the Commission to take action under this subtitle other than to begin a rulemaking proceeding.</p>

<p class="note-body">The section restates the source provision for clarity. In subsection (a), the word &ldquo;an employee delegated to act under section 10305 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;administrative law judge&rdquo; for consistency in view of section 3105 of title 5 and because the delegation under section 10305 may only be made to an administrative law judge.</p>
