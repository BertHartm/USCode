<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the cross-reference to chapter 7 of title 5 is omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the text of 49 App.:1481 (4th sentence words after last comma) is omitted as obsolete. The words &ldquo;National Transportation Safety Board&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;Board&rdquo; in 49 App.:1481 (4th sentence) because 49 App.:1655(d) transferred all functions, duties, and powers of the Civil Aeronautics Board under titles VI and VII of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85&ndash;726, 72 Stat. 775) to the Secretary of Transportation to be carried out through the former National Transportation Safety Board in the Department of Transportation. Title VI includes sections 602 and 609 [49 App.:1422, 1429], that provide for appeals to the Civil Aeronautics Board (subsequently transferred to the National Transportation Safety Board), and section 611(e) [49 App.:1431(e)], that provides for appeals to the National Transportation Safety Board. Under 49 App.:1902(a), the National Transportation Safety Board in the Department of Transportation was replaced by an independent National Transportation Safety Board outside the Department, and 49 App.:1903(a)(9)(A) gave the independent Board the authority to review appeals from actions of the Secretary under 49 App.:1422, 1429, and 1431(e).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;vote and&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words &ldquo;officer or employee of the Administration&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;member&rdquo; for clarity and consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words &ldquo;hearing or&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;referred to in subsection (a) of this section&rdquo; are added for clarity.</p>
