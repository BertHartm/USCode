<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a division, individual commissioner, employee board, or an employee delegated under section 10305 of this title to make an initial decision in a matter related to a carrier (other than a rail carrier), or, in the case of a matter referred to a joint board under section 10341 of this title, such joint board&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall, in any case in which an oral hearing is held or the Commission has found that an issue of general transportation importance is involved, complete all evidentiary proceedings related to the matter not later than the 180th day following institution of the proceeding and shall issue in writing the initial decision not later than the 270th day following institution of the proceeding; and</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 1(1) of the bill amends section 10324(c) of title 49, United States Code.

Finally, the words &ldquo;those sections&rdquo; [in section 2 of the bill] were inadvertently substituted for the words &ldquo;that section&rdquo;.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) When, under section 553(e) of title 5, an interested person (including a governmental authority) petitions the Interstate Commerce Commission to begin a rulemaking proceeding in a matter related to a rail carrier providing transportation subject to this subtitle, the Commission, or a division, an individual Commissioner, an employee board, an employee delegated to act under section 10305 of this title, or another person authorized to act on behalf of the Commission for any part of the proceeding, shall grant or deny that petition by the 120th day after receiving it. If the petition is granted, the Commission, or its delegate, shall begin an <!-- PDFPage:184 -->appropriate proceeding as soon as practicable. If the petition is denied, the reasons for the denial shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) If a petition is denied or action is not taken within the 120-day period under subsection (a) of this section, the petitioner may begin a civil action in an appropriate court of appeals of the United States for an order directing the Commission to begin a proceeding to take the action requested in the petition. A civil action under this subsection must be filed by the 60th day after the date of the denial or by the 60th day after the end of the 120-day period, whichever is appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The court of appeals shall order the Commission to begin the action requested in the petition to the Commission if the court finds that the action requested in that petition is necessary and failure to take that action will result in the continuation of practices that are not consistent with the public interest or are not in accordance with this subtitle. The finding of the court must be based on a preponderance of the evidence in the record before the Commission or its delegate, or, if the civil action is based on a petition on which action was not taken, in a new proceeding before the court. The court may not require the Commission to take action under this subtitle other than to begin a rulemaking proceeding.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10327. Commission action and appellate procedure in rail carrier proceedings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) This section applies to a matter before the Interstate Commerce Commission involving a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title. However, other sections of this subtitle related to action of the Commission in proceedings involving rail carriers supersede this section to the extent that they are inconsistent with the provisions of this section related to deadlines.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A division, individual Commissioner, employee board, or employee delegated under section 10305 of this title to make an initial decision in a matter related to one of those rail carriers shall complete all evidentiary proceedings related to the matter by the 180th day after assignment of the matter. The initial decision shall be submitted to the Commission in writing. If evidence is submitted in writing or testimony is taken at a public hearing, the initial decision shall be submitted to the Commission in writing by the 120th day after completion of all evidentiary proceedings and shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) specific findings of fact;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) specific and separate conclusions of law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an order; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) justification of the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission, or a division designated by the Commission, may void the requirement of an initial decision under subsection (b) of this section and may require the matter to be considered by the Commission or that division on finding that the matter involves a question of Commission policy, a new or novel issue of law, or an issue of general transportation importance, or that it is required for the timely execution of its functions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In a proceeding under this section, after the parties have had at least an opportunity to submit evidence in written form, the Commission shall give them an opportunity for briefs, written statements, or conferences of the parties. A conference of the parties must be chaired by a division, an individual Commissioner, an employee board, an employee delegated to act under section 10305 of this title, or an employee designated by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Copies of an initial decision under subsection (b) of this section shall be served on the interested parties. An initial decision becomes an action of the Commission on the 20th day after it is served on the interested parties, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an interested party files an appeal during the 20-day period, or by the end of an additional period of not more than 20 days, if authorized by the Commission or division designated by the Commission; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Commission stays or postpones the initial decision under subsection (g)(2) or (j) of this section within the period or additional period referred to in clause (1) of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Before an initial decision becomes an action of the Commission, the Commission, or a division or board designated by the Commission, may review the initial decision on its own initiative, and shall review an initial decision if an appeal is filed under subsection (e)(1) of this section. However, a board may not decide an appeal from an initial decision if the appeal may be further appealed to the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An initial decision may be reviewed on the record on which it is based or by a further hearing. If an initial decision is reviewed, it shall be stayed pending final determination of the matter, and it is an action of the Commission only after the final determination is made. If an appeal is filed under subsection (e)(1) of this section, the final determination shall be made by the 180th day after the appeal is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Review of, or appeal from, an initial decision shall be conducted under section 557 of title 5. The Commission may prescribe rules limiting and defining the issues and pleadings on review under section 557(b) of that title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) The Commission may, at any time on its own initiative because of material error, new evidence, or substantially changed circumstances&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reopen a proceeding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) grant rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration of an action of the Commission; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:185 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) change an action of the Commission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">An interested party may petition to reopen and reconsider an action of the Commission under this paragraph under regulations of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may grant a rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration of an action of the Commission that was taken by a division designated by the Commission if it finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the action involves a matter of general transportation importance; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the action would be affected materially because of clear and convincing new evidence or changed circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">An interested party may petition for rehearing, reargument, or reconsideration of an action of the Commission under this paragraph under regulations of the Commission. The Commission may stay an action pending a final determination under this paragraph. The Commission shall complete reconsideration and take final action by the 120th day after the petition is granted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) An action of the Commission under this section and an action of a designated division under subsection (c) of this section is effective on the 30th day after service on the parties to the proceeding unless the Commission provides for it to become effective on an earlier date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Notwithstanding this subtitle, an action of the Commission under this section and an action of a designated division under subsection (c) of this section is final on the date on which it is served, and a civil action to enforce, enjoin, suspend, or set aside the action may be filed after that date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) The Commission may extend a time period established by this section for a period of not more than 90 days. The extension shall be granted if a majority of the Commissioners agree to it by public vote.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) If an extension granted under subsection (j) of this section is not sufficient to allow for completion of necessary proceedings, the Commission may grant a further extension in an extraordinary situation if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a majority of the Commissioners agree to the further extension by public vote; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) not later than the 15th day before expiration of the extension granted under subsection (j) of this section, the Commission submits a written report to the Congress that a further extension has been granted. The report shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a full explanation of the reasons for the further extension;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the anticipated duration of the further extension;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the issues involved in the matter before the Commission; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the names of personnel of the Commission working on the matter.</p>
