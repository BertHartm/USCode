<p class="note-body">In this section, the words &ldquo;foreign air transportation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; and &ldquo;in the case of overseas or foreign air transportation&rdquo; because 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(B) provides that 49 App.:1373 no longer applies to interstate or overseas air transportation and 49 App.:1376(a)&ndash;(e), restated in section 41901 of the revised title, governs rates for the transportation of mail by aircraft. See section 40102(a) of the revised title defining &ldquo;air transportation&rdquo; to mean interstate or foreign air transportation or the transportation of mail by aircraft. The word &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; is omitted as being included in &ldquo;terms&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(7), the words &ldquo;or other emergency&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;other calamitous visitation&rdquo; for consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;no longer gainfully employed&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;retired&rdquo; and &ldquo;For purposes of this subsection, the term &lsquo;retired&rsquo; means no longer gainfully employed as defined by the Board&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(4), the words &ldquo;an individual who has severely impaired vision or hearing or another physical or mental handicap&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;handicapped person&rdquo; and &ldquo;For the purposes of this subsection, the term &lsquo;handicapped person&rsquo; means any person who has severely impaired vision or hearing, and any other physically or mentally handicapped person, as defined by the Board&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
