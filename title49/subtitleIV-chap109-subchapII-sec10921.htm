<p class="note-body">The section consolidates and restates the source provisions for clarity. The words &ldquo;may provide transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter II, III, or IV of chapter 105 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;section 302(c) of this title, subsection (b) of this section, in the exception in subsection (a)(14) of this section&rdquo; in 49:303(c), for &ldquo;for-hire transportation business by motor vehicle, in interstate or foreign commerce&rdquo; in 49:303(c), and for &ldquo;transportation subject to this chapter&rdquo; in 49:909(a), 909(f), and 1010(a)(1), for clarity and to conform to the style of the revised subtitle. In 49:303(c) and 306(a)(1), the words &ldquo;on any public highway or within any reservation under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States&rdquo; are omitted because this requirement is included in section 10521 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;for compensation sell or offer for sale transportation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or shall make any contract, agreement, or arrangement to provide, procure, furnish, or arrange for such transportation or shall hold himself or itself out by advertisement, solicitation, or otherwise as one who sells, provides, procures, contracts, or arranges&rdquo; in 49:311(a) are omitted as surplus in view of the definition of &ldquo;broker&rdquo; in section 10102 of the revised title that includes the omitted words.</p>
