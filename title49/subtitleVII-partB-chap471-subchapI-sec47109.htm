<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Except as otherwise provided in this chapter&rdquo; because subsections (b) and (c) restate the only parts of the chapter that provide exceptions to the general rule stated in subsection (a). In clauses (1) and (2), the words &ldquo;for a project&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;payable on account of any project contained in an approved project grant application submitted in accordance with this chapter&rdquo; in 49 App.:2209(a) and &ldquo;payable on account of any project contained in an approved project grant application&rdquo; in 49 App.:2209(b) for consistency in this chapter and to eliminate unnecessary words. A project cost is allowable only if it is incurred under a grant agreement made under the chapter, and a grant agreement may be made only if the project grant application is approved. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;number of passenger boardings&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;enplaning .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. passengers enplaned&rdquo; because of the definition of &ldquo;passenger boardings&rdquo; in section 47102 of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;If, under subsection (a) of this section, the Government's share of allowable costs .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is less than the share applied on June 30, 1975, under section 17(b) of the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970&rdquo; and &ldquo;(3) the percentage necessary to increase the Government's share to the percentage that applied on June 30, 1975, under section 17(b) of the Act&rdquo; are substituted for 49 App.:2209(c) (last sentence) for clarity. The words &ldquo;of the total of all lands therein&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter&rdquo; because subsections (a) and (b) are the only other parts of the chapter that specify the United States Government's share of allowable project costs.</p>
