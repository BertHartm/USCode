<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;shall include provisions prohibiting&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;At a minimum .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall prohibit&rdquo; because of the restatement. In restating 49 App.:2804(c)(1), the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; is omitted before &ldquo;food&rdquo; the first time it appears and added before &ldquo;food&rdquo; the 2d time it appears to reflect the probable intent of Congress. Compare the location of the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; in 49 App.:2804(c)(2).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the word &ldquo;decides&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;determined&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title. The words &ldquo;of the nonfood products&rdquo; are added for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;in making such arrangement&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
