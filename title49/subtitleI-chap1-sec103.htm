<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;To carry out&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;for purposes of administering and enforcing&rdquo; in 49:1652a for consistency and to eliminate surplus words. The words &ldquo;under those laws&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;pursuant to Federal railroad safety laws&rdquo; to eliminate surplus words. The words &ldquo;is responsible&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall retain full and final responsibility&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall be responsible&rdquo; to eliminate surplus words. The words &ldquo;and for the establishment of all policies with respect to implementation of such laws&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;Each of these components&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;vested in the Secretary&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;as set forth in the statutes transferred to the Secretary&rdquo; in 49:1655(f)(3)(A) for clarity and consistency. The words &ldquo;section 6(e)(1), (2), and (6)(A) of the Department of Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. 1655(e)(1), (2), and (6)(A))&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;subsection (e) of this section (other than subsection (e)(4) of this section)&rdquo; in 49:1655(f)(3)(A) for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the word &ldquo;law&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;statute&rdquo; in 49:1652(e)(4) for consistency. The words after &ldquo;administratively final&rdquo; in 49:1655(f)(3)(C) are omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement of the revised title and those laws giving a right to appeal.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 5(m)(1) amends 49:103(c)(1) to include a reference to section 20134(c) of the revised title. The reference is included because 45:445 on which section 20134(c) is based provides that the duties and powers under that provision are to be carried out by the Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration rather than the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
