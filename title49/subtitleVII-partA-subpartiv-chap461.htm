<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the text of 49 App.:1481 (4th sentence words after last comma) is omitted as obsolete. The words &ldquo;National Transportation Safety Board&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;Board&rdquo; in 49 App.:1481 (4th sentence) because 49 App.:1655(d) transferred all functions, duties, and powers of the Civil Aeronautics Board under titles VI and VII of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85&ndash;726, 72 Stat. 775) to the Secretary of Transportation to be carried out through the former National Transportation Safety Board in the Department of Transportation. Title VI includes sections 602 and 609 [49 App.:1422, 1429], that provide for appeals to the Civil Aeronautics Board (subsequently transferred to the National Transportation Safety Board), and section 611(e) [49 App.:1431(e)], that provides for appeals to the National Transportation Safety Board. Under 49 App.:1902(a), the National Transportation Safety Board in the Department of Transportation was replaced by an independent National Transportation Safety Board outside the Department, and 49 App.:1903(a)(9)(A) gave the independent Board the authority to review appeals from actions of the Secretary under 49 App.:1422, 1429, and 1431(e).</p>

The petition must be filed not later than 60 days after the order is issued. The court may allow the petition to be filed after the 60th day only if there are reasonable grounds for not filing by the 60th day.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Judicial Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a petition is filed under subsection (a) of this section, the clerk of the court immediately shall send a copy of the petition to the Secretary or Administrator, as appropriate.

Findings of fact by the Secretary or Administrator, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Requirement for Prior Objection</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In reviewing an order under this section, the court may consider an objection to an order of the Secretary or Administrator only if the objection was made in the proceeding conducted by the Secretary or Administrator or if there was a reasonable ground for not making the objection in the proceeding.</p>
