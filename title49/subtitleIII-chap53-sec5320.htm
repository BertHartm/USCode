<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of this section is to provide for the construction by a public entity of a suspended light rail system technology pilot project&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to assess the state of new technology for a suspended light rail system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to establish the feasibility, costs, and benefits of using the system to transport passengers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>General Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The project shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) use new rail technology with individual vehicles on a prefabricated elevated steel guideway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) be stability-seeking with a center of gravity for the detachable passenger vehicles located below the point of wheel-rail contact; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) use vehicles that are driven by overhead bogies with high efficiency, low maintenance electric motors for each wheel, operating in a slightly sloped plane from vertical for the wheels and the running rails, to further increase stability, acceleration, and braking performance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Competition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation shall conduct a national competition to select a public entity with which to make a full funding grant agreement to construct the project. Not later than April 16, 1992, the Secretary shall select 3 public entities to be finalists in the competition. In conducting the competition and selecting public entities, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the public entity's demonstrated understanding and knowledge of the project and its technical, managerial, and financial capacity to construct, manage, and operate the project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) maximizing potential contributions to the cost of the project by State, local, and private sector entities, including donation of in-kind services and materials.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall award a grant to each finalist to be used to participate in the final phase of the competition under procedures the <!-- PDFPage:186 -->Secretary prescribes. A grant may not be more than 80 percent of the cost of participating. A finalist may not receive more than one-third of the amount made available under subsection (h)(1)(A) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Not later than July 15, 1992, the Secretary shall select from among the 3 finalists a public entity with which to make a full funding grant agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Environmental Impact</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 270 days after a public entity is selected under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall approve and publish in the Federal Register a notice announcing either a finding of no significant impact or a draft environmental impact statement for the project. The alternatives analysis for the project shall include a decision on whether to construct the project. If a draft statement is published, the Secretary, not later than 180 days after publication, shall approve and publish in the Federal Register a notice of completion of a final environmental impact statement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Full Funding Grant Agreement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 60 days after carrying out the requirements of subsection (d) of this section, the Secretary shall make a full funding grant agreement under section 5309 of this title with the public entity selected under subsection (c) of this section to construct the project. The agreement shall provide that the system vendor for the project shall finance&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 100 percent of any deficit incurred in operating the project in the first 2 years of revenue operations of the project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 50 percent of any deficit incurred in operating the project in the 3d year of revenue operations of the project.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Notice To Proceed</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 30 days after making the full funding grant agreement, the Secretary shall issue a notice to proceed with construction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Option Not To Construct and Reawarding the Grant</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than 30 days after completing preliminary engineering and design, the selected public entity shall decide whether to proceed to constructing the project. If the entity decides not to proceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary shall not make the full funding grant agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) remaining amounts received shall be returned to the Secretary and credited to the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary shall use the credited amount and other amounts to be provided under this section to award to another entity selected under subsection (c)(1) of this section a grant under section 5309 of this title to construct the project.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 60 days after a decision is made under paragraph (1) of this subsection, a grant shall be awarded under paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection after completing a competitive process for selecting the grant recipient.</p>
