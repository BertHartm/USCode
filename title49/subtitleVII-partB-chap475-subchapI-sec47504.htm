<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Submissions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An airport operator that submitted a noise exposure map and related information under section 47503(a) of this title may submit a noise compatibility program to the Secretary of Transportation after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) consulting with public agencies and planning authorities in the area surrounding the airport, United States Government officials having local responsibility for the airport, and air carriers using the airport; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) notice and an opportunity for a public hearing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A program submitted under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall state the measures the operator has taken or proposes to take to reduce existing noncompatible uses and prevent introducing additional noncompatible uses in the area covered by the map. The measures may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) establishing a preferential runway system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) restricting the use of the airport by a type or class of aircraft because of the noise characteristics of the aircraft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) constructing barriers and acoustical shielding and soundproofing public buildings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) using flight procedures to control the operation of aircraft to reduce exposure of individuals to noise in the area surrounding the airport; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) acquiring land, air rights, easements, development rights, and other interests to ensure that the property will be used in ways compatible with airport operations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Approvals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall approve or disapprove a program submitted under subsection (a) of this section (except as the program is related to flight procedures referred to in subsection (a)(2)(D) of this section) not later than 180 days after receiving it. The Secretary shall approve the program (except as the program is related to flight procedures referred to in subsection (a)(2)(D)) if the program&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) does not place an unreasonable burden on interstate or foreign commerce;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is reasonably consistent with achieving the goal of reducing noncompatible uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible uses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provides for necessary revisions because of a revised map submitted under section 47503(b) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A program (except as the program is related to flight procedures referred to in subsection (a)(2)(D) of this section) is deemed to be approved if the Secretary does not act within the 180-day period.</p>

A grant may be made to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an airport operator submitting the program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a unit of local government in the area surrounding the airport, if the Secretary decides the unit is able to carry out the project.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for projects to soundproof residential buildings&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if the airport operator submits updated noise exposure contours, as required by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) if the Secretary determines that the proposed projects are compatible with the purposes of this chapter;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to an airport operator and unit of local government referred to in paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B) of this subsection to soundproof residential buildings located on residential properties, and to acquire residential properties, at which noise levels are not compatible with normal operations of an airport&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if the airport operator submits updated noise exposure contours, as required by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) if the Secretary determines that the proposed projects are compatible with the purposes of this chapter;</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Government's share that would apply if the amounts available for the project were made available under subchapter I of chapter 471 of this title for a project at the airport.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The provisions of subchapter I of chapter 471 of this title related to grants apply to a grant made under this chapter, except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) section 47109(a) and (b) of this title; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) <cap-smallcap>Aircraft noise primarily caused by military aircraft</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may make a grant under this subsection for a project even if the purpose of the project is to mitigate the effect of noise primarily caused by military aircraft at an airport.</p>
