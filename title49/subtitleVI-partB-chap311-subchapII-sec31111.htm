<p class="note-body">Subsection (b)(1) is substituted for 49 App.:2311(a) and (b) (2d&ndash;last sentences) to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (f), the word &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; is added before &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo; for consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f)(4)(C), the reference to regulations prescribed under subsection (e) is substituted for the reference in the source to regulations issued under subsection (a) to be more precise. The word &ldquo;amendment&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;revision&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (g) is substituted for 49 App.:2311(d) to eliminate unnecessary words. The Secretary's general authority to prescribe regulations is provided in 49:322(a).
