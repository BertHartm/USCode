The words &ldquo;is not a beneficial owner only because of providing or arranging for any part of the intermodal transportation of property&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;providing or arranging for any portion of intermodal transportation of property shall in no case be a beneficial owner of such property, for purposes of this paragraph, solely by reason of providing or arranging for such transportation&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (3)(A), the words &ldquo;(as such terms are defined in section 10102 of this title)&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of clause (1) of this section.</p>
