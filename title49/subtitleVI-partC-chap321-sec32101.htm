<p class="note-body">In clause (1), the text of 15:1901(11) is omitted as surplus because the complete title of the Secretary of Transportation is used the first time the term appears in a section. The definition of &ldquo;property loss reduction standard&rdquo; is combined with the definition of &ldquo;bumper standard&rdquo; because the former term is used only in the <!-- PDFPage:505 -->definition of the latter term. Before subclause (A), the words &ldquo;the purpose of which is&rdquo; and &ldquo;eliminate&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In subclauses (A) and (B), the words &ldquo;(or both)&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In subclause (A), the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo; is omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (2), the words &ldquo;of passenger motor vehicles&rdquo; and &ldquo;engaged&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (5)(A), the words &ldquo;manufacturing or assembling&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;engaged in the manufacturing or assembling of&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (8), the words &ldquo;maintenance or operation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;operation, maintenance, or use&rdquo; to eliminate an unnecessary word.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clauses (12) and (13), the words &ldquo;the Northern Mariana Islands&rdquo; are added because of section 502(a)(2) of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America, as enacted by the Act of March 24, 1976 (Public Law 94&ndash;241, 90 Stat. 268), and as proclaimed to be in effect by the President on January 9, 1978 (Proc. No. 4534, Oct. 24, 1977, 42 F.R. 56593). The words &ldquo;the Canal Zone&rdquo; are omitted because of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (12), the word &ldquo;means&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;includes&rdquo; as being more appropriate. The words &ldquo;a State of the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;each of the several States&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (13), the words &ldquo;of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico&rdquo; are omitted as surplus because the district court of Puerto Rico is a district court of the United States under 28:119.</p>
