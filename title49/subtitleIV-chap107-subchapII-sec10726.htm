<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) A carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I or III of chapter 105 of this title (except an express carrier) may not charge or receive more compensation for the transportation of property of the same kind or of passengers&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for a shorter distance than for a longer distance over the same line or route in the same direction (the shorter distance being included in the longer distance); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) under a through rate than under the total of the intermediate rates it may charge or receive under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">This paragraph does not authorize a carrier to charge or receive equal compensation for transportation over a shorter distance than a longer distance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, a carrier operating over a circuitous line or route to or from a place in competition with another carrier of the same type that operates over a more direct line or route may establish a rate (otherwise complying with this chapter) for that transportation to meet the rate of the carrier operating over the more direct line or route. A rate established for transportation over a circuitous route under this subsection is not evidence of the compensatory character of rates in other proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In special cases, the Commission may authorize a carrier to charge less for transportation over a longer distance than it charges for transportation over a shorter distance. The Commission may prescribe the extent to which a carrier authorized to charge less under this subsection may be granted relief from subsection (a) of this section. However, the Commission may not authorize a rate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to or from the more distant place unless it is reasonably compensatory; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) because of potential water competition not actually in existence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">[(c) Repealed. Pub. L. 96&ndash;448, title II, &sect;220, Oct. 14, 1980, 94 Stat. 1928.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Commission shall begin a proceeding under subsection (b) of this section on application of a carrier. A carrier may file a proposed rate with its application, and if the application is approved, the Commission shall allow the rate to become effective one day after the approval becomes effective.</p>
