<p class="note-body">In the introductory matter of subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;Subject to this chapter and other provisions of law&rdquo; are inserted to inform the reader that other sections of the chapter and subtitle qualify the grant of jurisdiction to the Interstate Commerce Commission under the section.

The words &ldquo;and providing facilities for&rdquo; are omitted as being included in the definition of &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; applicable to the subtitle. The words &ldquo;to the extent that passengers, property, or both, are transported by motor carrier&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;whether such commerce moves wholly by motor vehicle or partly by motor vehicle and partly by rail, express, or water&rdquo; to eliminate surplus words and because of the Commission's jurisdiction over transportation by motor carrier, and the term &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo; is a defined term incorporated into the definition of &ldquo;motor carrier&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10525. Exempt motor carrier transportation entirely in one State</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission shall exempt transportation of a motor carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this subchapter from compliance with this subtitle when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the motor carrier provides transportation entirely in one State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Commission finds that the nature or quantity of transportation provided by the motor carrier does not substantially affect or impair uniform regulation by the Commission of motor carrier transportation in carrying out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may begin a proceeding under this section on its own initiative or on application of a motor carrier, a State authority having jurisdiction to regulate intrastate transportation by motor vehicle on the highways of that State, or an interested party. An application must be under oath and must contain information required by Commission regulation. The Commission may exempt the transportation by motor carrier or class of motor carriers. When an exemption is granted, the Commission shall issue a certificate of exemption describing the conditions required by the public interest under which the certificate is issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When an application for exemption is accompanied by a certificate of the authority of the State in which the applicant provides transportation stating the finding of the State authority that the applicant is entitled to a certificate of exemption under this section, the exemption is effective on the 60th day after the application is filed with the Commission unless the Commission denies the application before that date. If not denied before that date, the exemption remains effective until the Commission thereafter denies or revokes it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Commission may revoke any part of an exemption granted under this section when it finds that the nature or quantity of the transportation by the motor carrier or class of motor carriers affects or impairs, or is likely substantially to affect or impair uniform regulation by the Commission of motor carrier transportation in carrying out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title. If the exemption is revoked, the Commission shall restore without further proceedings the authority any such motor carrier had to provide transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under this subchapter at the time the exemption was effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the Commission has no jurisdiction under this subchapter over transportation, except transportation of household goods, by a motor carrier operating solely within the State of Hawaii. The State of Hawaii may regulate transportation exempt from the jurisdiction of the <!-- PDFPage:204 -->Commission under this subsection and, to the extent provided by a motor carrier operating solely within the State of Hawaii, transportation exempt from the jurisdiction of the Commission under section 10523 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) State regulation of the operations of a motor carrier covered by an exemption under this section is not a burden on interstate or foreign commerce.</p>
