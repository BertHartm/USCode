<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Grant Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in this section, an amount apportioned under section 47114(c)(1) or (d)(2) of this title is available for making grants for any purpose for which amounts are made available under section 48103 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Period of Availability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An amount apportioned under section 47114 of this title is available to be obligated for grants under the apportionment only during the fiscal year for which the amount was apportioned and the 2 fiscal years immediately after that year or the 3 fiscal years immediately following that year in the case of a primary airport that had less than .05 percent of the total boardings in the United States in the preceding calendar year. If the amount is not obligated under the apportionment within that time, it shall be added to the discretionary fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Primary Airports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An amount apportioned to a sponsor of a primary airport under section 47114(c)(1) of this title is available for grants for any public-use airport of the sponsor included in the national plan of integrated airport systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A sponsor of a primary airport may make an agreement with the Secretary of Transportation waiving any part of the amount apportioned for the airport under section 47114(c)(1) of this title if the Secretary makes the waived amount available for a grant for another public-use airport in the same State or geographical area as the primary airport.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>State Use</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An amount apportioned to a State under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) section 47114(d)(2)(A) of this title is available for grants for airports located in the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) section 47114(d)(2)(B) or (C) of this title is available for grants for airports described in section 47114(d)(2)(B) or (C) and located in the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Special Apportionment Categories</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall use amounts available to the discretionary fund under section 47115 of this title for each fiscal year as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) At least 31 percent for grants for airport noise compatibility planning under section 47505(a)(2) of this title and for carrying out noise compatibility programs under section 47504(c) of this title. The Secretary may count the amount of grants made for such planning and programs with funds apportioned under section 47114 in that fiscal year in determining whether or not such 31 percent requirement is being met in that fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) at&nbsp;<sup><a href="#47117_1_target" name="47117_1">1</a></sup> least 4 percent for each of fiscal years 1997 and 1998 to sponsors of current or former military airports designated by the Secretary under section 47118(a) of this title for grants for developing current and former military airports to improve the capacity of the national air transportation system and to sponsors of noncommercial service airports for grants for operational and maintenance expenses at any such airport if the amount of such grants to the sponsor of the airport does not exceed $30,000 in that fiscal year, if the Secretary determines that the airport is adversely affected by the closure or realignment of a military base, and if the sponsor of the airport certifies that the airport would otherwise close if the airport does not receive the grant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary decides that an amount required to be used for grants under paragraph (1) of this subsection cannot be used for a fiscal year because there are insufficient qualified grant applications, the amount the Secretary determines cannot be used is available during the fiscal year for grants for other airports or for other purposes for which amounts are authorized for grants under section 48103 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Limitation for Commercial Service Airport in Alaska</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not make a grant for a commercial service airport in Alaska of more than 110 percent of the amount apportioned for the airport for a fiscal year under section 47114(e) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Discretionary Use of Apportionments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, if the Secretary finds, based on the notices the Secretary receives under section 47105(f) of this title or otherwise, that an amount apportioned under section 47114 of this title will not be used for grants during a fiscal year, the Secretary may use an equal amount for grants during that fiscal year for any of the purposes for which amounts are authorized for grants under section 48103 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may make a grant under paragraph (1) of this subsection only if the Secretary decides that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the total amount used for grants for the fiscal year under section 48103 of this title will not be more than the amount made available under section 48103 for that fiscal year; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:722 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amounts authorized for grants under section 48103 of this title for later fiscal years are sufficient for grants of the apportioned amounts that were not used for grants under the apportionment during the fiscal year and that remain available under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Limiting Authority of Secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority of the Secretary to make grants during a fiscal year from amounts that were apportioned for a prior fiscal year and remain available for approved airport development project grants under subsection (b) of this section may be impaired only by a law enacted after September 3, 1982, that expressly limits that authority.</p>
