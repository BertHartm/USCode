<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission may require&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) carriers, brokers, lessors, and associations, or classes of them as the Commission may prescribe, to file annual, periodic, and special reports with the Commission containing answers to questions asked by it; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a person furnishing cars or protective services against heat or cold to a rail or express carrier providing transportation subject to this subtitle, to file reports with the Commission containing answers to questions about those cars or services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) An annual report shall contain an account, in as much detail as the Commission may require, of the affairs of the carrier, broker, lessor, or association for the 12-month period ending on the 31st day of December of each year. However, when an annual report is made by a motor carrier, a broker, or a lessor or an association maintained by or interested in one of them, the person making the report may elect to make it for the 13-month period accounting year ending at the close of one of the last 7 days of each calendar year if the books of the person making the report are kept by that person on the basis of that accounting year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An annual report shall be filed with the Commission by the end of the 3d month after the end of the year for which the report is made unless the Commission extends the filing date or changes the period covered by the report. The annual report and, if the Commission requires, any other report made under this section, shall be made under oath.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission shall streamline and simplify, to the maximum extent practicable, the reporting requirements applicable under this subchapter to motor common carriers of property with respect to transportation provided under certificates to which the provisions of section 10922(b)(4)(E)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#11145_1_target" name="11145_1">1</a></sup> of this title apply and to motor contract carriers of property with respect to transportation provided under permits to <!-- PDFPage:332 -->which the provisions of section 10923(b)(5)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#11145_1_target" name="11145_1">1</a></sup> of this title apply.</p>
