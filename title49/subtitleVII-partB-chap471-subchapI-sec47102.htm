In subclause (ii), the words &ldquo;existing airport hazard .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the creation of a new airport hazard&rdquo; are added for clarity and consistency in this chapter.</p>

The word &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;Department of Transportation&rdquo; because of 49:102(b). The words &ldquo;Administrator of the&rdquo; are added because of 49:106(b).</p>
