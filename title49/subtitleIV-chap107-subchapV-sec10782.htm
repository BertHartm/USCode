<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) establish, for each piece of property except land owned or used by the carrier as a common carrier, the original cost to date, cost of reproduction new and cost of reproduction less depreciation, and analyze the methods used to establish those costs and the reasons for differences among them;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establish other values, and elements of value, of that property and analyze the methods used to establish them and the reasons for differences between them and the cost values established under clause (1) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) establish separately from improvements, the original cost on the date of dedication to public use, of all lands, rights of way, and terminals owned or used by the carrier as a common carrier and establish their current value;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) identify property not held by the carrier as a common carrier, its original cost, and current value and analyze the methods of valuation used;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) establish the amount and value of assistance or grant of right of way made to the carrier, or to a previous corporation that operated its property, by the United States Government or by a State, county, or municipal government, or by an individual, association, or corporation and the amount and value of any concession and allowance made by the United States Government or another of those governments in consideration of that assistance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) identify the grants of land to that carrier, or to a previous corporation that operated its property, by the United States Government, or by a State, county, or municipal government, the amount of money derived from the sale of part of those grants, the value of the unsold parts (established as of the date acquired and currently), and the amount and value of any concession and allowance made by the carrier to the United States Government, or another of those governments, in consideration of that assistance or grant of land.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may prescribe elements to consider in establishing the cost to date of property owned or used by a carrier. However, in establishing that cost, the Commission shall investigate and include in those elements&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the history and organization of the corporation that currently operates the property and of previous corporations that also operated that property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) increases or decreases of securities during reorganization of that corporation or such a previous corporation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) money received through the issuance of securities by that corporation or such a previous corporation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) syndicating, banking, and other financial arrangements under which those securities were issued and the expenses thereof;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the net and gross earnings of those corporations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the expenditure of all money and the purposes of those expenditures in as much detail as the Commission determines to be necessary.</p>
