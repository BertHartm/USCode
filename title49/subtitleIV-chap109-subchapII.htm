<p class="note-body">The section consolidates and restates the source provisions for clarity. The words &ldquo;may provide transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter II, III, or IV of chapter 105 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;section 302(c) of this title, subsection (b) of this section, in the exception in subsection (a)(14) of this section&rdquo; in 49:303(c), for &ldquo;for-hire transportation business by motor vehicle, in interstate or foreign commerce&rdquo; in 49:303(c), and for &ldquo;transportation subject to this chapter&rdquo; in 49:909(a), 909(f), and 1010(a)(1), for clarity and to conform to the style of the revised subtitle. In 49:303(c) and 306(a)(1), the words &ldquo;on any public highway or within any reservation under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States&rdquo; are omitted because this requirement is included in section 10521 of the revised title. The words &ldquo;for compensation sell or offer for sale transportation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or shall make any contract, agreement, or arrangement to provide, procure, furnish, or arrange for such transportation or shall hold himself or itself out by advertisement, solicitation, or otherwise as one who sells, provides, procures, contracts, or arranges&rdquo; in 49:311(a) are omitted as surplus in view of the definition of &ldquo;broker&rdquo; in section 10102 of the revised title that includes the omitted words.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Commission shall issue a certificate to a person authorizing that person to provide regular-route transportation entirely in one State as a motor common carrier of passengers if such intrastate transportation is to be provided on a route over which the carrier has authority on the effective date of this subsection to provide interstate transportation of pas<!-- PDFPage:296 -->sengers if the Commission finds that the person is fit, willing, and able to provide the intrastate transportation to be authorized by the certificate and to comply with this subtitle and regulations of the Commission, unless the Commission finds, on the basis of evidence presented by any person objecting to the issuance of the certificate, that the transportation to be authorized would directly compete with a commuter bus operation and it would have a significant adverse effect on commuter bus service in the area in which the competing service will be performed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission shall issue a certificate to a person authorizing that person to provide regular-route transportation entirely in one State as a motor common carrier of passengers if such intrastate transportation is to be provided on a route over which the carrier has been granted authority, or will be granted authority, after the effective date of this section to provide interstate transportation of passengers if the Commission finds that the person is fit, willing, and able to provide the intrastate transportation to be authorized by the certificate and to comply with this subtitle and regulations of the Commission, unless the Commission finds, on the basis of evidence presented by any person objecting to the issuance of the certificate, that the transportation to be authorized is not consistent with the public interest.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) Subject to subparagraph (F) of this paragraph, any intrastate transportation authorized by issuance of a certificate under this paragraph shall be deemed to be transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title. Upon issuance of such certificate, the carrier shall establish initial rates, rules, and practices applicable to such transportation to the same extent and in the same manner as a motor common carrier of passengers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under such subchapter establishes rates, rules, and practices applicable to such interstate transportation.

<p class="statutory-body-block">In addition, in making any finding relating to public interest under paragraph (1)(D) of this subsection, the Commission shall consider whether or not the person objecting to issuance <!-- PDFPage:297 -->of the certificate is a motor common carrier of passengers which is providing, or is willing and able to provide, the transportation to be authorized by the certificate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection relating to the Commission finding that transportation to be authorized by issuance of a certificate is not consistent with the public interest shall not apply to any application under this subsection for authority to provide&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) A person holding (A) a certificate issued under subsection (b) of this section to provide transportation as a motor common carrier of property, and (B) a permit issued under section 10923 of this title to provide transportation as a motor contract carrier of property, may transport property under the certificate in the same motor vehicle and at the same time as property under the permit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, a motor common carrier of passengers who has authority under this section to provide special or charter transportation of passengers and to provide regular-route transportation of passengers may transport the special or charter passengers in the same motor vehicle with regular-route passengers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall only apply to transportation of passengers entirely in a State if the motor common carrier of passengers has authority under the laws of such State to provide within such State special or charter transportation of passengers and regular-route transportation of passengers and if the laws of such State and the certificate, permit, or other authority under which such carrier provides intrastate transportation in such State authorizes such carrier to transport special or charter passengers in the same motor vehicle with regular-route passengers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Special or charter transportation of passengers may only be provided under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph in the same motor vehicle as regular-route transportation of passengers if the mixing of such passengers does not interfere with the obligation of the carrier to comply with section 11101 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Subject to such regulations as the Commission may issue, a person who has authority under this section to provide charter transportation of passengers may transport groups of charter passengers in the same motor vehicle at the same time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) A motor common carrier of property may deliver to or receive from a rail carrier a trailer moving in trailer-on-flat-car service at any point on the route of the rail carrier if the motor carrier is authorized to serve the origin and destination points of the traffic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Commission, notwithstanding any other provision of law (other than such paragraph (2)), shall not issue any certificate to <!-- PDFPage:299 -->any motor common carrier, any permit to any motor contract carrier, or any certificate of registration under section 10530 of this title to any foreign motor carrier or foreign motor private carrier, domiciled in any contiguous foreign country or owned or controlled by persons of any contiguous foreign country in the four-year period beginning on the effective date of this subsection. The President of the United States may extend, beyond such four-year period, such moratorium or impose such a moratorium with respect to any contiguous foreign country or political subdivision thereof which substantially prohibits grants of authority to persons from the United States to provide transportation by motor vehicle for compensation in such foreign country or political subdivision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The President of the United States may remove or modify, in whole or in part, any moratorium imposed under paragraph (1) of this subsection on the issuance of certificates or permits if the President determines that such removal or modification is in the national interest and notifies, in writing, the Congress of such removal or modification before the date on which such removal or modification is to take effect. In any case in which such moratorium applies to a contiguous foreign country or political subdivision thereof which substantially prohibits grants of authority to persons from the United States to provide transportation by motor vehicle for compensation in such foreign country or political subdivision, such removal or modification shall not take effect before the 60th day following the date on which the Congress is notified of such removal or modification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Subject to the provisions of this subparagraph, during a moratorium imposed under paragraph (1) of this subsection with respect to any contiguous foreign country or political subdivision thereof, the Commission may issue certificates of registration under section 10530 of this subtitle to foreign motor carriers and foreign motor private carriers domiciled in such country or political subdivision and to foreign motor carriers and foreign motor private carriers owned or controlled by persons of such country or political subdivision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Subject to clause (iv) of this subparagraph, if the person to be issued the certificate of registration during the moratorium is a foreign motor carrier domiciled in the foreign country or political subdivision or is a foreign motor carrier owned or controlled by persons of the foreign country or political subdivision, such certificate may only authorize such carrier to provide transportation of property (including exempt items) by motor vehicle in a municipality in the United States which is adjacent to the foreign country or political subdivision, in contiguous municipalities in the United States any one of which is adjacent to the foreign country or political subdivision, or in a zone in the United States that is adjacent to, and commercially a part of, the municipality or municipalities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Subject to clause (v) of this subsection, if the person to be issued the certificate of registration during the moratorium is a foreign motor private carrier domiciled in the foreign country or political subdivision or is a foreign motor private carrier owned or controlled by persons of the foreign country or political subdivision, such certificate may only authorize such carrier to provide transportation of property (including exempt items) by motor vehicle in a municipality in the United States which is adjacent to the foreign country or political subdivision, in contiguous municipalities in the United States any one of which is adjacent to the foreign country or political subdivision, or in a zone in the United States that is adjacent to, and commercially a part of, the municipality or municipalities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) If the person to be issued the certificate of registration during the moratorium is a foreign motor carrier domiciled in the foreign country or political subdivision and owned or controlled by persons of the United States, such certificate may only authorize such carrier to provide interstate transportation of property (including exempt items) by motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) If the person to be issued the certificate of registration during the moratorium is a foreign motor private carrier domiciled in the foreign country or political subdivision and owned or controlled by persons of the United States, such certificate may only authorize such carrier to provide interstate transportation of property (including exempt items) by motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vi) In this subparagraph, the terms &ldquo;exempt items&rdquo;, &ldquo;foreign motor carrier&rdquo;, &ldquo;foreign motor private carrier&rdquo;, and &ldquo;interstate transportation&rdquo; have the meanings such terms have under section 10530(a) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Limited Modification to Moratorium on Issuance of Certificates or Permits With Respect to Mexico</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, May 6, 1993, 58 F.R. 27647, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Secretary of Transportation</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 [see 49 U.S.C. 10922(m)(1), (2)] imposed a moratorium on the issuance of certificates or permits to motor carriers domiciled in, or owned or controlled by persons of, a contiguous foreign country. The Act authorized the President to remove the moratorium in whole or in <!-- PDFPage:302 -->part for any country or political subdivision thereof upon determining that such action is in the national interest. Sixty days&rsquo; advance notice to the Congress is required whenever the removal or modification applies to a contiguous foreign country or political subdivision thereof that substantially prohibits the granting of motor carrier authority to persons from the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">I am pleased that an agreement between the United States and Mexico has been concluded to ensure fair and reciprocal treatment for charter and tour bus interests on both sides of the border. The agreement reached, however, does not allow for full access to cross-border and domestic markets. Therefore, the moratorium must reflect the conditions under which operating authority may be issued to Mexican charter and tour companies under the agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, 49 U.S.C. section 10922(<em>l</em>)(2)(A) [now 10922(m)(2)(A)], I hereby make a limited modification to the moratorium imposed by that section and all actions taken by my predecessors under that section on the issuance of certificates or permits to motor carriers domiciled in, or owned or controlled by persons of, a contiguous foreign country.</p>
<p class="note-body">The moratorium is modified only to authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission to grant Mexican motor carriers authority to transport passengers in charter or special operations, in foreign commerce, in round trip or one-way service between Mexico and the United States pursuant to the following restrictions:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. The Mexican motor carrier can conduct cross-border charter or special service in the United States only when the international tour or charter begins in Mexico;</p>
<p class="note-body">2. Tickets or tour packages for such operations cannot be sold in the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The terms of the grants of authority given to Mexican motor carriers will be limited by the life of the agreement with Mexico covering reciprocal cross-border charter and special operations.</p>
<p class="note-body">This action applies only to international charter and tour operations, does not allow for point-to-point service within the United States, and does not authorize companies to conduct cross-border regular route service. This action preserves the status quo with respect to Mexican trucking companies and Mexican companies engaged in regular route service, and will maintain the moratorium on those operations through September 25, 1994, unless earlier revoked or modified.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, you are directed to notify the Congress today on my behalf that, effective 60 days hence, the moratorium will no longer be in effect for Mexican charter and tour bus companies subject to the above stated conditions. Because of this action, the Interstate Commerce Commission will then accept and process expeditiously all applications for operating authority from Mexican owned, controlled, or domiciled charter and tour bus firms. I should note that applications in Mexico by United States charter and tour bus firms will be similarly treated.</p>

<p class="note-body">As set forth in the Statement of Administrative Action regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that I submitted to the Congress on November 3, 1993, the moratorium with respect to Mexico will be lifted in phases to coincide with the schedule of liberalization in the relevant provisions of the NAFTA. The NAFTA specifically states that the moratorium will not apply to the provision of cross-border charter or tour bus services as of the date of entry into force of the Agreement.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Commission may issue a certificate under section 10922 or 10530 or a permit under section 10923 only if the carrier (including a motor private carrier and a foreign motor private carrier) applying for such certificate files with the Commission a bond, insurance policy, or other type of security approved by the Commission, in an amount not less than such amount as the Secretary of Transportation prescribes pursuant to, or as is required by, section 30&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10927_1_target" name="10927_1">1</a></sup> of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, section 18&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10927_1_target" name="10927_1">1</a></sup> of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, and the laws of the State or States in which the carrier is operating, to the extent applicable. The security must be sufficient to pay, not more than the amount of the security, for each final judgment against the carrier for bodily injury to, or death of, an individual resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance, or use of motor vehicles under the certificate or permit, or for loss or damage to property (except property referred to in paragraph (3) of this subsection), or both. A certificate or permit remains in effect only as long as the carrier satisfies the requirements of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A motor carrier and a foreign motor private carrier and foreign motor carrier (as defined under section 10530(a)) operating in the United States when providing transportation between places in a foreign country or between a place in one foreign country and a place in another foreign country shall comply with the requirements of sections 10329 and 10330 that apply to a motor carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title. To protect the public, the Commission may require any such motor carrier to file the type of security that a motor carrier is required to file under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission may require a motor common carrier providing transportation under a certificate to file with the Commission a type of security sufficient to pay a shipper or consignee for damage to property of the shipper or consignee placed in the possession of the motor common carrier as the result of transportation provided under this subtitle. A carrier required by law to pay a shipper or consignee for loss, damage, or default for which a connecting motor common carrier is responsible is subrogated, to the extent of the amount paid, to the rights of the shipper or consignee under any such security.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may issue a broker's license to a person under section 10924 of this title only if the person files with the Commission a bond, insurance policy, or other type of security approved by the Commission to ensure that the transportation for which a broker arranges is provided. The license remains in effect only as long as the broker complies with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Commission may require a household goods freight forwarder providing service under a permit issued under section 10923 of this title to file with the Commission a bond, insurance policy, or other type of security approved by the Commission. The security must be sufficient to pay, not more than the amount of the security, for each final judgment against the household goods freight forwarder for bodily injury to, or death of, an individual, or loss of, or damage to, property (other than property referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection), resulting from the negligent operation, maintenance, or use of motor vehicles by or under the direction and control of the household goods freight forwarder when providing transfer, collection, or delivery service under this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may require a household goods freight forwarder providing service under a permit or a freight forwarder to file with the Commission a bond, insurance policy, or other type of security approved by the Commission sufficient to pay, not more than the amount of the security, for loss of, or damage to, property for which the freight forwarder provides service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Commission may determine the type and amount of security filed with it under this section.</p>

Unless suspended or revoked, the Commission may grant the temporary authority for not more than 180 days. A grant of temporary authority does not establish a presumption that permanent authority to provide transportation will be granted under this subchapter.</p>

A grant of temporary authority does not establish a presumption that permanent authority to provide transportation will be granted under this subchapter.</p>

<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; is substituted each place for &ldquo;service&rdquo; and &ldquo;transportation service&rdquo; for consistency and as being more precise because the jurisdictional grant to the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter III of chapter 105 of the revised title is jurisdiction over transportation. The words &ldquo;Without regard to subchapter II of chapter 103 of this title and subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;without hearings or other proceedings&rdquo; as being more precise. The words &ldquo;motor carrier or water carrier&rdquo; are inserted before &ldquo;carrier capable&rdquo; for clarity. The phrase &ldquo;not more than 180 days&rdquo; is retained. The amendments made by sections 102 and 103 of the Act of March 27, 1942, striking the words &ldquo;not to exceed 180 days&rdquo; expired on March 31, 1947, and the words struck out were restored to the law, by virtue of section 1501 of the same Act, as amended (60 Stat. 345; 50 U.S.C. app. 645). The words &ldquo;and urgent&rdquo; are omitted as redundant. The words &ldquo;place&rdquo; and &ldquo;area&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;point&rdquo; and &ldquo;territory&rdquo;, respectively, for consistency. The words &ldquo;or points&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;in its discretion&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;Unless suspended or revoked&rdquo; are made applicable to 49:911(a) for clarity and consistency. The words &ldquo;under this subchapter&rdquo; are inserted for clarity. 49:310a(c) is omitted for consistency and as being unnecessary in view of the authority of the Commission to grant the authority and the general authority of the Commission under section 10321(a) of the revised title to carry out the subtitle.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10931. Motor common carriers providing transportation entirely in one State</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A motor common carrier may provide transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title without a certificate issued by the Commission under section 10922 of this title, when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the carrier provides transportation entirely in one State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the carrier is not controlled by, controlling, or under common control with a carrier providing transportation outside the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the carrier has applied for, and has been issued, a certificate of public convenience and necessity by the State authority having jurisdiction to issue such a certificate, permitting the carrier to provide intrastate transportation by motor vehicle; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the intrastate certificate was issued after, and the certificate states that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) notice was given to interested parties through publication in the Federal Register of the filing of the application by the carrier and the desire of the carrier to provide transportation otherwise under the jurisdiction of the Commission within the limits of the certificate issued by the State authority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reasonable opportunity to be heard was given; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the State authority considered and found that the public convenience and necessity require that the carrier be permitted to provide transportation under the jurisdiction of the Commission within limits that do not exceed the scope of the certificate issued by the State authority.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) An interested party that opposed issuing the certificate to a motor common carrier in a proceeding before a State authority may petition the Commission for reconsideration of a decision of the State authority. On reconsideration, the Commission, based on the record before the State authority, may affirm, reverse, or change that decision, but only with respect to the transportation subject to Commission jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission may require, before a motor common carrier provides transportation authorized under this section, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a certified copy of the carrier's intrastate certificate and other appropriate information be filed with the Commission; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the carrier comply with applicable requirements established by the Commission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Commission shall issue a certificate of registration to a motor common carrier authorizing the carrier to provide transportation under this section. The authority granted under the certificate is subject to all other applicable provisions of this subtitle. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and subchapter III of chapter 113 of this title, the certificate of registration may be transferred if it is transferred with the intrastate certificate. Transfer of the intrastate certificate without the certificate of registration revokes the certificate of registration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The certificate of registration issued by the Commission is valid as long as the motor common carrier provides transportation entirely in the State from which it received its intrastate certificate and is not controlled by, controlling, or under common control with, a carrier providing transportation outside the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) On the 180th day after the termination, restriction in scope, or suspension of the intrastate certificate, the authority granted under this section to provide transportation is revoked or likewise restricted unless the intrastate certificate is renewed or reissued or the restriction is removed by that 180th day.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Transportation authorized under this section may be suspended or revoked by the Commission under section 10925 of this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Except as specifically provided in a certificate or permit, the holder of a motor carrier certificate or permit issued as the result of an application filed before September 2, 1950, authorizing the carrier to provide transportation in the United States or between the United States and a foreign country (to the extent the transportation is in the United States), may provide the transportation between a place in the United States and a place in a territory or possession of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) without being authorized to do so by the Interstate Commerce Commission; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the same extent and subject to the same conditions of the certificate or permit of the carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) A motor common carrier providing transportation under an intrastate certificate issued by a State and under a certificate of registration issued by the Commission under section 206(a)(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act (76 Stat. 912) that has been in effect since October 15, 1962, may continue to provide transportation otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if the certificate of the State authorizing intrastate transportation is limited to a specified period of time, only for that period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) subject to all other applicable provisions of this subtitle;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) as long as the carrier provides transportation only in the State issuing the intrastate certificate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) as long as the carrier is not controlled by, controlling, or under common control with, a carrier providing transportation outside the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in subchapter III of chapter 113 of this title, the certificate of registration issued by the Commission may be transferred if it is transferred with the intrastate certificate. Transfer of the intrastate certificate without the certificate of registration revokes the certificate of registration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) On the 180th day after the termination, restriction in scope, or suspension of the intrastate certificate, the authority granted under the certificate of registration is revoked or likewise restricted unless the intrastate certificate is renewed or reissued or the restriction is removed by that 180th day. The certificate of registration may be suspended or revoked by the Commission under section 10925 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Under regulations of the Commission, a motor common carrier transporting passengers under a certificate issued by the Commission as the result of an application filed before January 2, 1967, or under a reissuance of the operating authority provided in the certificate, may provide transportation to any place subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title for special and chartered parties.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Each motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title shall be responsible for all acts or omissions of any of its agents which relate to the performance of household goods transportation services (including accessorial or terminal services) subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title and which are within the actual or apparent authority of the agent from the carrier or which are ratified by the carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Each motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title shall use due diligence and reasonable care in selecting and maintaining agents who are sufficiently knowledgeable, fit, willing, and able to provide adequate household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services) and to fulfill the obligations imposed upon them by this subtitle and by such carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Whenever the Commission has reason to believe from a complaint or investigation that an agent providing household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services) under the authority of a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title has violated section 11901(k) or 11917 of this title or is consistently not fit, willing, and able to provide adequate household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services), it may issue to such agent a complaint stating the charges and containing notice of the time and place of a hearing which shall be held no later than 60 days after service of the complaint to such agent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such agent shall have the right to appear at such hearing and rebut the charges contained in the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If such person does not appear at the hearing or if the Commission finds that the agent has violated section 11901(k) or 11917 of this title or is consistently not fit, willing, and able to provide adequate household goods transportation services (including accessorial and terminal services), it may issue an order to compel <!-- PDFPage:316 -->compliance with the requirement that the agent be fit, willing, and able. Thereafter, the Commission may issue an order to limit, condition, or prohibit such agent from any involvement in the transportation or provision of services incidental to the transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title if, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, it finds that such agent, within a reasonable time after the date of issuance of a compliance order under this section, but in no event less than 30 days after such date of issuance, has willfully failed to comply with such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Upon filing of a petition with the Commission by an agent who is the subject of an order issued pursuant to the second sentence of paragraph (3) of this subsection and after notice, a hearing shall be held with an opportunity to be heard. At such hearing, a determination shall be made whether the order issued pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection should be rescinded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Any agent adversely affected or aggrieved by an order of the Commission issued under this subsection may seek relief in the appropriate United States court of appeals as provided by and in the manner prescribed in chapter 158 of title 28, United States Code.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12), do not apply to discussions or agreements between a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title and its agents (whether or not an agent is also a carrier) related solely to (1) rates for the transportation of household goods under the authority of the principal carrier, (2) accessorial, terminal, storage, or other charges for services incidental to the transportation of household goods transported under the authority of the principal carrier, (3) allowances relating to transportation of household goods under the authority of the principal carrier, and (4) ownership of a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title by an agent or membership on the board of directors of any such motor common carrier by an agent.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10935. Discontinuing bus transportation in one State</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) When a motor common carrier of passengers having intrastate authority under the laws of a State, and interstate authority under a certificate issued under section 10922 of this title, to provide transportation over any route to any point in such State has proposed to discontinue providing transportation over such route to such point or to reduce its level of service over such route to such point to a level which is less than one trip per day (excluding Saturdays and Sundays) and the carrier has requested the department, agency, or instrumentality of such State having jurisdiction over granting such discontinuance or reduction for permission to discontinue such intrastate transportation or to reduce its level of service to a level which is less than one trip per day (excluding Saturdays and Sundays) and the request has been denied (in whole or in part) or such department, agency, or instrumentality has not acted finally (in whole or in part) on the request by the 120th day after the carrier made the request, the carrier may petition the Commission for such permission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When a petition is filed under subsection (a) of this section, the carrier shall certify that he has notified (1) the Governor of the State in which such transportation is provided, (2) the State authority having jurisdiction over granting discontinuances of transportation by motor common carriers of passengers and reductions in levels of service by such carriers, (3) local governments having jurisdiction over areas which would be affected if such petition is granted, and (4) such other interested persons as the Commission may specify by regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Any person (including a department, agency, or instrumentality of a State or local government) may object to the Commission to the granting of permission to any motor common carrier of passengers to discontinue or reduce transportation under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If no person objects under subsection (c) of this section to the granting of permission to discontinue or reduce transportation under this section within 20 days after the carrier files with the Commission the petition for such discontinuance or reduction, the Commission shall grant such permission at the end of such 20-day period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1)(A) Subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, if, within 20 days after a carrier files a petition for permission to discontinue providing intrastate transportation over any route to any point or to reduce its level of service over such route to such point to a level which is less than one trip per day (excluding Saturdays and Sundays), any person objects under subsection (c) of this section to the Commission to the granting of such permission, the Commission shall grant such permission unless the Commission finds, on the basis of evidence presented by the person objecting to the granting of such permission, that such discontinuance or reduction is not consistent with the public interest or that continuing the transportation, without the proposed discontinuance or reduction, will not constitute an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) This paragraph shall apply to intrastate transportation of passengers which is being provided by a motor common carrier of passengers on a route over which such carrier was granted, on or before August 1, 1982, authority to provide interstate transportation of passengers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, if, within 20 days after a carrier files a petition for permission to discontinue providing intrastate transportation over any route to any <!-- PDFPage:317 -->point or to reduce its level of service over such route to such point to a level which is less than one trip per day (excluding Saturdays and Sundays), any person objects under subsection (c) of this section to the Commission to the granting of such permission, the Commission shall grant such permission unless the Commission finds, on the basis of evidence presented by the person objecting to the granting of such permission, that continuing the transportation, without the proposed discontinuance or reduction, will not constitute an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce. For the purposes of this paragraph, continuance of the transportation would not constitute an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce only if discontinuance or reduction of such transportation is not consistent with the public interest and the interstate and intrastate revenues from such service under reasonable pricing practices are not less than the variable costs of providing the transportation proposed to be discontinued or reduced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) This paragraph shall apply to intrastate transportation of passengers which is being provided by a motor common carrier of passengers on a route over which such carrier was granted after August 1, 1982, and before the effective date of this section, or is granted on or after such effective date, authority to provide interstate transportation of passengers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall only grant permission to a carrier to discontinue intrastate transportation over any route to any point under this subsection if such carrier has applied for authority to discontinue its interstate transportation over such route to such point under section 10925(b) of this title and the Commission has granted or will grant such authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If any person objects under subsection (c) of this section to the granting of permission to discontinue or reduce transportation under this section within 20 days after the carrier files with the Commission the petition for such discontinuance or reduction, the carrier, within 15 days after the filing of such objection with the Commission, shall furnish to the Commission and to objecting persons&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an estimate of the annual subsidy required, if any, to continue the service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) traffic, revenue, and other data necessary to determine the amount of annual financial assistance, if any, which would be required to continue the service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such other information as the Commission may require by regulation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall take final action upon such petition not later than 90 days after the date the carrier files such petition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Before a discontinuance or reduction in level of service proposed in a petition filed by a carrier under subsection (a) of this section has become effective, the Commission may order the carrier to continue any part of the intrastate transportation in not to exceed the 165-day period beginning on the date the carrier files such petition with the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) In making a finding under subsection (e)(1) of this section, the Commission shall accord great weight to the extent to which interstate and intrastate revenues received for providing the transportation proposed to be discontinued or reduced are less than the variable costs of providing such transportation, including depreciation for revenue equipment. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the carrier filing a petition for permission to discontinue or reduce service shall have the burden of proving the amount of the interstate and intrastate revenues received for providing the transportation and the variable costs of providing the transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In making a finding under subsection (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section, the Commission shall consider, to the extent applicable, at least&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the national transportation policy of section 10101 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) whether the motor common carrier of passengers has received an offer of, or is receiving, financial assistance to provide the transportation to be discontinued or reduced from a financially responsible person (including a governmental authority); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the case of a petition to discontinue transportation to any point, whether the transportation is the last motor carrier of passenger service to such point and whether a reasonable alternative to such service is available.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) No State or political subdivision thereof and no interstate agency or other agency of two or more States shall enact or enforce any law, rule, regulation, standard, or other provision having the force and effect of law relating to discontinuance or reduction in the level of intrastate service by a motor common carrier of passengers subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title corresponding to an interstate service initiated pursuant to the provisions of section 10922(c)(4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10935_1_target" name="10935_1">1</a></sup> of this title, except to the extent that notice of discontinuance or reduction in service, not in excess of 30 days, may be required.</p>
