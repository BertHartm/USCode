In clause (1), the words &ldquo;carrying out their duties and powers&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;in the performance of all of their authorized functions&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. In clause (2), the words &ldquo;of the United States Government, State and local governments, governments of foreign countries, interstate authorities, and private organizations&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;of Federal, interstate, State, local, and foreign governments and non-governmental organizations&rdquo; for clarity and consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1), before clause (A), the words &ldquo;the Secretary shall deposit the fee in the Treasury&rdquo; are <!-- PDFPage:93 -->added for clarity.
