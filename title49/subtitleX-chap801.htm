<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Rules</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A negotiable bill of lading may be negotiated by indorsement. An indorsement may be made in blank or to a specified person. If the goods are deliverable to the order of a specified person, then the bill must be indorsed by that person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A negotiable bill of lading may be negotiated by delivery when the common carrier, under the terms of the bill, undertakes to deliver the goods to the order of a specified person and that person or a subsequent indorsee has indorsed the bill in blank.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A negotiable bill of lading may be negotiated by a person possessing the bill, regardless of the way in which the person got possession, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a common carrier, under the terms of the bill, undertakes to deliver the goods to that person; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) when the bill is negotiated, it is in a form that allows it to be negotiated by delivery.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Validity Not Affected</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The validity of a negotiation of a bill of lading is not affected by the negotiation having been a breach of duty by the person making the negotiation, or by the owner of the bill having been deprived of possession by fraud, accident, mistake, duress, loss, theft, or conversion, if the person to whom the bill is negotiated, or a person to whom the bill <!-- PDFPage:1210 -->is subsequently negotiated, gives value for the bill in good faith and without notice of the breach of duty, fraud, accident, mistake, duress, loss, theft, or conversion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Negotiation by Seller, Mortgagor, or Pledgor to Person Without Notice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When goods for which a negotiable bill of lading has been issued are in a common carrier's possession, and the person to whom the bill has been issued retains possession of the bill after selling, mortgaging, or pledging the goods or bill, the subsequent negotiation of the bill by that person to another person receiving the bill for value, in good faith, and without notice of the prior sale, mortgage, or pledge has the same effect as if the first purchaser of the goods or bill had expressly authorized the subsequent negotiation.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Superiority of Rights</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a negotiable bill of lading is negotiated to a person for value in good faith, that person's right to the goods for which the bill was issued is superior to a seller's lien or to a right to stop the transportation of the goods. This subsection applies whether the negotiation is made before or after the common carrier issuing the bill receives notice of the seller's claim. The carrier may deliver the goods to an unpaid seller only if the bill first is surrendered for cancellation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Mortgagee and Lien Holder Rights Not Affected</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, this chapter does not limit a right of a mortgagee or lien holder having a mortgage or lien on goods against a person that purchased for value in good faith from the owner, and got possession of the goods immediately before delivery to the common carrier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Delivery and Agreement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The holder of a bill of lading may transfer the bill without negotiating it by delivery and agreement to transfer title to the bill or to the goods represented by it. Subject to the agreement, the person to whom the bill is transferred has title to the goods against the transferor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Compelling Indorsement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a negotiable bill of lading is transferred for value by delivery without being negotiated and indorsement of the transferor is essential for negotiation, the transferee may compel the transferor to indorse the bill unless a contrary intention appears. The negotiation is effective when the indorsement is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Notification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) When a transferee notifies the common carrier that a nonnegotiable bill of lading has been transferred under subsection (a) of this section, the carrier is obligated directly to the transferee for any obligations the carrier owed to the transferor immediately before the notification. However, before the carrier is notified, the transferee's title to the goods and right to acquire the obligations of the carrier may be defeated by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) garnishment, attachment, or execution on the goods by a creditor of the transferor; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) notice to the carrier by the transferor or a purchaser from the transferor of a later purchase of the goods from the transferor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A common carrier has been notified under this subsection only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an officer or agent of the carrier, whose actual or apparent authority includes acting on the notification, has been notified; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the officer or agent has had time, exercising reasonable diligence, to communicate with the agent having possession or control of the goods.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Liability for Nonreceipt and Misdescription</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in this section, a common carrier issuing a bill of lading is liable for damages caused by nonreceipt by the carrier of any part of the goods by the date shown in the bill or by failure of the goods to correspond with the description contained in the bill. The carrier is liable to the owner of goods transported under a nonnegotiable bill (subject to the right of stoppage in transit) or to the holder of a negotiable bill if the owner or holder gave value in good faith relying on the description of the goods in the bill or on the shipment being made on the date shown in the bill.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Nonliability of Carriers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A common carrier issuing a bill of lading is not liable under subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) when the goods are loaded by the shipper;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) when the bill&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) describes the goods in terms of marks or labels, or in a statement about kind, quantity, or condition; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is qualified by &ldquo;contents or condition of contents of packages unknown&rdquo;, &ldquo;said to contain&rdquo;, &ldquo;shipper's weight, load, and count&rdquo;, or words of the same meaning; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to the extent the carrier does not know whether any part of the goods were received or conform to the description.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the bill contains the words &ldquo;shipper's weight, load, and count&rdquo;, or words of the same meaning indicating the shipper loaded the goods.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Carrier's Duty To Determine Kind, Quantity, and Number</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) When bulk freight is loaded by a shipper that makes available to the common carrier adequate facilities for weighing the freight, the carrier must determine the kind and quantity of the freight within a reasonable time after receiving the written request of the shipper to make the determination. In that situation, inserting the words &ldquo;shipper's weight&rdquo; or words of the same meaning in the bill of lading has no effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When goods are loaded by a common carrier, the carrier must count the packages of goods, if package freight, and determine the kind and quantity, if bulk freight. In that situation, inserting in the bill of lading or in a notice, receipt, contract, rule, or tariff, the words &ldquo;shipper's weight, load, and count&rdquo; or words indicating that the shipper described and loaded the goods, has no effect except for freight concealed by packages.</p>
