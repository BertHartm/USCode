<p class="note-body">In this part, the words &ldquo;overseas air commerce&rdquo; and &ldquo;overseas air transportation&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete because there no longer is a distinction in economic or safety regulation between &ldquo;interstate&rdquo; and &ldquo;overseas&rdquo; air commerce or air transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">In this section, the words &ldquo;In carrying out .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this part&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;In the exercise and performance of its powers and duties under this chapter&rdquo; in 49 App.:1302(a), &ldquo;In the exercise and performance of his powers and duties under this chapter&rdquo; in 49 App.:1303, and &ldquo;In exercising the authority granted in, and discharging the duties imposed by, this chapter&rdquo; in 49 App.:1347 for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (a) and (b), the reference to subpart II is added because the policy applies only to economic issues, and under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85&ndash;726, 72 Stat. 731), the Civil Aeronautics Board was given responsibility for economic issues.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2), the word &ldquo;full&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;the recommendations of the Secretary of Transportation on&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete because the Secretary carries out 49 App.:1302(a). The words &ldquo;and full evaluation of any report or recommendation submitted under section 1307 of this Appendix&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete because the report and recommendations are no longer required.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(4), the words &ldquo;by air carriers and foreign air carriers&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Sovereignty and Public Right of Transit</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The United States Government has exclusive sovereignty of airspace of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A citizen of the United States has a public right of transit through the navigable airspace. To further that right, the Secretary of Transportation shall consult with the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board established under section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 792) before prescribing a regulation or issuing an order or procedure that will have a significant impact on the accessibility of commercial airports or commercial air transportation for handicapped individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Use of Airspace</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall develop plans and policy for the use of the navigable airspace and assign by regulation or order the use of the airspace necessary to ensure the safety of aircraft and the efficient use of airspace. The Administrator may modify or revoke an assignment when required in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator shall prescribe air traffic regulations on the flight of aircraft (including regulations on safe altitudes) for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) navigating, protecting, and identifying aircraft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) protecting individuals and property on the ground;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) using the navigable airspace efficiently; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) preventing collision between aircraft, between aircraft and land or water vehicles, and between aircraft and airborne objects.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) To establish security provisions that will encourage and allow maximum use of the navigable airspace by civil aircraft consistent with national security, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) establish areas in the airspace the Administrator decides are necessary in the interest of national defense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) by regulation or order, restrict or prohibit flight of civil aircraft that the Administrator cannot identify, locate, and control with available facilities in those areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding the military exception in section 553(a)(1) of title 5, subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5 applies to a regulation prescribed under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Foreign Aircraft</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A foreign aircraft, not part of the armed forces of a foreign country, may be navigated in the United States as provided in section 41703 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Aircraft of Armed Forces of Foreign Countries</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Aircraft of the armed forces of a foreign country may be navigated in the United States only when authorized by the Secretary of State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>No Exclusive Rights at Certain Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person does not have an exclusive right to use an air navigation facility on which Government money has been expended. However, providing services at an airport by only one fixed-based operator is not an exclusive right if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is unreasonably costly, burdensome, or impractical for more than one fixed-based operator to provide the services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) allowing more than one fixed-based operator to provide the services requires a reduction in space leased under an agreement existing on September 3, 1982, between the operator and the airport.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the exemption is necessary to avoid unreasonable hardship for the traffic in the markets that cannot be accommodated by the air carriers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) granting the exemption will not result in an unreasonable advantage to any party in a labor dispute where the inability to accommodate traffic in a market is a result of the dispute.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Secretary grants an exemption to a foreign air carrier under this subsection, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ensure that air transportation that the foreign air carrier provides under the exemption is made available on reasonable terms;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) monitor continuously the passenger load factor of air carriers in the market that hold certificates under section 41102 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) review the exemption at least every 30 days to ensure that the unusual circumstances that established the need for the exemption still exist.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may renew an exemption (including renewals) under this subsection for not more than 30 days. An exemption may continue for not more than 5 days after the unusual circumstances that established the need for the exemption cease.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding section 1341(a)(1)(B) of title 31, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may make a contract of not more than 5 years for the following types of services and items of supply related to those services for which amounts otherwise would be available for obligation only in the fiscal year for which appropriated:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) operation, maintenance, and support of facilities and installations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) operation, maintenance, and modification of aircraft, vehicles, and other highly complex equipment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) specialized training requiring high quality instructor skills, including training of pilots and aircrew members and foreign language training.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) base services, including ground maintenance, aircraft refueling, bus transportation, and refuse collection and disposal.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Required Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may make a contract under this section only if the Administrator finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there will be a continuing requirement for the service consistent with current plans for the proposed contract period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) providing the service will require a substantial initial investment in plant or equipment, or will incur a substantial contingent liability for assembling, training, or transporting a specialized workforce; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the contract will promote the best interests of the United States by encouraging effective competition and promoting economies in operation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When making a contract under this section, the Administrator shall be guided by the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The part of the cost of a plant or equipment amortized as a cost of contract performance may not be more than the ratio between the period of contract performance and the an<!-- PDFPage:744 -->ticipated useful commercial life (instead of physical life) of the plant or equipment, considering the location and specialized nature of the plant or equipment, obsolescence, and other similar factors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Administrator shall consider the desirability of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) obtaining an option to renew the contract for a reasonable period of not more than 3 years, at a price that does not include charges for nonrecurring costs already amortized; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reserving in the Administrator the right, on payment of the unamortized part of the cost of the plant or equipment, to take title to the plant or equipment under appropriate circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Ending Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contract made under this section shall be ended if amounts are not made available to continue the contract into a subsequent fiscal year. The cost of ending the contract may be paid from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an appropriation originally available for carrying out the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an appropriation currently available for procuring the type of service concerned and not otherwise obligated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) amounts appropriated for payments to end the contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding section 1341(a)(1)(B) of title 31 and to the extent that amounts otherwise are available for obligation, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may make a contract of more than one but not more than 5 fiscal years to purchase property, except a contract to construct, alter, or make a major repair or improvement to real property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Required Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may make a contract under this section if the Administrator finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the contract will promote the safety or efficiency of the national airspace system and will result in reduced total contract costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the minimum need for the property to be purchased is expected to remain substantially unchanged during the proposed contract period in terms of production rate, procurement rate, and total quantities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) there is a reasonable expectation that throughout the proposed contract period the Administrator will request appropriations for the contract at the level required to avoid cancellation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) there is a stable design for the property to be acquired and the technical risks associated with the property are not excessive; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the estimates of the contract costs and the anticipated savings from the contract are realistic.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall prescribe regulations for acquiring property under this section to promote the use of contracts under this section in a way that will allow the most efficient use of those contracts. The regulations may provide for a cancellation provision in the contract to the extent the provision is necessary and in the best interest of the United States. The provision may include consideration of recurring and nonrecurring costs of the contractor associated with producing the item to be delivered under the contract. The regulations shall provide that, to the extent practicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to broaden the aviation industrial base&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a contract under this section shall be used to seek, retain, and promote the use under that contract of subcontractors, vendors, or suppliers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on accrual of a payment or other benefit accruing on a contract under this section to a subcontractor, vendor, or supplier participating in the contract, the payment or benefit shall be delivered in the most expeditious way practicable; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) this section and regulations prescribed under this section may not be carried out in a way that precludes or curtails the existing ability of the Administrator to provide for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) competition in producing items to be delivered under a contract under this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) ending a prime contract when performance is deficient with respect to cost, quality, or schedule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Contract Provisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A contract under this section may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be used for the advance procurement of components, parts, and material necessary to manufacture equipment to be used in the national airspace system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provide that performance under the contract after the first year is subject to amounts being appropriated; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) contain a negotiated priced option for varying the number of end items to be procured over the period of the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If feasible and practicable, an advance procurement contract may be made to achieve eco<!-- PDFPage:745 -->nomic-lot purchases and more efficient production rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Cancellation Payment and Notice of Cancellation Ceiling</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If a contract under this section provides that performance is subject to an appropriation being made, it also may provide for a cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if the appropriation is not made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before awarding a contract under this section containing a cancellation ceiling of more than $100,000,000, the Administrator shall give written notice of the proposed contract and cancellation ceiling to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives. The contract may not be awarded until the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date of the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Ending Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contract made under this section shall be ended if amounts are not made available to continue the contract into a subsequent fiscal year. The cost of ending the contract may be paid from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an appropriation originally available for carrying out the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an appropriation currently available for procuring the type of property concerned and not otherwise obligated; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) For a project for terminal development, gates and related areas, or a facility occupied or used by at least one air carrier or foreign air carrier on an exclusive or preferential basis, a price payable by an air carrier or foreign air carrier using the facilities must at least equal the price paid by an air carrier or foreign air carrier using a similar facility at the airport that was not financed with passenger facility revenue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Passenger facility revenues that are held by an air carrier or an agent of the carrier after collection of a passenger facility fee constitute a trust fund that is held by the air carrier or agent for the beneficial interest of the eligible agency imposing the fee. Such carrier or agent holds neither legal nor equitable interest in the passenger facility revenues except for any handling fee or retention of interest collected on unremitted proceeds as may be allowed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Compliance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) As necessary to ensure compliance with this section, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations requiring recordkeeping and auditing of accounts maintained by an air carrier or foreign air carrier and its agent collecting a passenger facility fee and by the eligible agency imposing the fee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary periodically shall audit and review the use by an eligible agency of passenger facility revenue. After review and a public hearing, the Secretary may end any part of the authority of the agency to impose a passenger facility fee to the extent the Secretary decides that the revenue is not being used as provided in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may set off amounts necessary to ensure compliance with this section <!-- PDFPage:753 -->against amounts otherwise payable to an eligible agency under subchapter I of chapter 471 of this title if the Secretary decides a passenger facility fee is excessive or that passenger facility revenue is not being used as provided in this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Authority to impose fee</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Unless the Secretary objects within 30 days after receipt of the eligible agency's notice, the eligible agency is authorized to impose a passenger facility fee in accordance with the terms of its notice under this subsection.</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Handling of fees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A covered air carrier shall segregate in a separate account passenger facility revenue equal to the average monthly liability for fees collected under this section by such carrier or any of its agents for <!-- PDFPage:754 -->the benefit of the eligible agencies entitled to such revenue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Trust fund status</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a covered air carrier or its agent fails to segregate passenger facility revenue in violation of the subsection, the trust fund status of such revenue shall not be defeated by an inability of any party to identify and trace the precise funds in the accounts of the air carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A covered air carrier and its agents may not grant to any third party any security or other interest in passenger facility revenue.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Application required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before commencing commercial air tour operations over a national park or tribal lands, a commercial air tour operator shall apply to the Administrator for authority to conduct the operations over the park or tribal lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Competitive bidding for limited capacity parks</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever an air tour management plan limits the number of commercial air tour operations over a national park during a specified time frame, the Administrator, in cooperation with the Director, shall issue operation specifications to commercial air tour operators that conduct such operations. The operation specifications shall include such terms and conditions as the Administrator and the Director find necessary for management of commercial air tour operations over the park. The Administrator, in cooperation with the Director, shall develop an open competitive process for evaluating proposals from persons interested in providing commercial air tour operations over the park.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Number of operations authorized</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining the number of authorizations to issue to provide commercial air tour operations over a national park, the Administrator, in cooperation with the Director, shall take into consideration the provisions of the air tour management plan, the number of existing commercial air tour operators and current level of service and equipment provided by any such operators, and the financial viability of each commercial air tour operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Cooperation with nps</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before granting an application under this paragraph, the Administrator, in cooperation with the Director, shall develop an air tour management plan in accordance with subsection (b) and implement such plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) <cap-smallcap>Time limit on response to atmp applications</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall make every effort to act on any application under this paragraph and issue a decision on the application not later than 24 months after it is received or amended.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the operator secures a letter of agreement from the Administrator and the national park superintendent for that national park describing the conditions under which the operations will be conducted; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the total number of operations under this exception is limited to not more than five flights in any 30-day period over a particular park.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Special rule for safety requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding subsection (c), an existing commercial air tour operator shall apply, not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this section, for operating authority under part 119, 121, or 135 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations. A new entrant commercial air tour operator shall apply for such authority before conducting commercial air tour operations over a national park or tribal lands. The Administrator shall make every effort to act on any such application for a new entrant and issue a decision on the application not later than 24 months after it is received or amended.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Objective</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The objective of any air tour management plan shall be to develop acceptable and effective measures to mitigate or prevent the significant adverse impacts, if any, of commercial air tour operations upon the natural and cultural resources, visitor experiences, and tribal lands.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Environmental determination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In establishing an air tour management plan under this subsection, the Administrator and the Director shall each sign the environmental decision document required by section 102 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 <!-- PDFPage:764 -->U.S.C. 4332) which may include a finding of no significant impact, an environmental assessment, or an environmental impact statement and the record of decision for the air tour management plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may prohibit commercial air tour operations over a national park in whole or in part;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may establish conditions for the conduct of commercial air tour operations over a national park, including commercial air tour routes, maximum or minimum altitudes, time-of-day restrictions, restrictions for particular events, maximum number of flights per unit of time, intrusions on privacy on tribal lands, and mitigation of noise, visual, or other impacts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) shall apply to all commercial air tour operations over a national park that are also within 1/2 mile outside the boundary of a national park;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) shall include incentives (such as preferred commercial air tour routes and altitudes, relief from caps and curfews) for the adoption of quiet aircraft technology by commercial air tour operators conducting commercial air tour operations over a national park;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) shall provide for the initial allocation of opportunities to conduct commercial air tour operations over a national park if the plan includes a limitation on the number of commercial air tour operations for any time period; and</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;40129. Collaborative decisionmaking pilot program</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Establishment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this section, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall establish a collaborative decisionmaking pilot program in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Duration</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subsection (k), the pilot program shall be in effect for a period of 2 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Guidelines.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Issuance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, shall issue guidelines concerning the pilot program. Such guidelines, at a minimum, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) define a capacity reduction event;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establish the criteria and process for determining when a capacity reduction <!-- PDFPage:768 -->event exists that warrants the use of collaborative decisionmaking among carriers at airports participating in the pilot program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) prescribe the methods of communication to be implemented among carriers during such an event.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Views</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may obtain the views of interested parties in issuing the guidelines.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Determination of Existence of Capacity Reduction Event</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon a determination by the Administrator that a capacity reduction event exists, the Administrator may authorize air carriers and foreign air carriers operating at an airport participating in the pilot program to communicate for a period of time not to exceed 24 hours with each other concerning changes in their respective flight schedules in order to use air traffic capacity most effectively. The Administration shall facilitate and monitor such communication. The Attorney General, or the Attorney General's designee, may monitor such communication.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Selection of Participating Airports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 30 days after the date on which the Administrator establishes the pilot program, the Administrator shall select 2 airports to participate in the pilot program from among the most capacity-constrained airports in the Nation based on the Administration's Airport Capacity Benchmark Report 2001 or more recent data on airport capacity that is available to the Administrator. The Administrator shall select an airport for participation in the pilot program if the Administrator determines that collaborative decisionmaking among air carriers and foreign air carriers would reduce delays at the airport and have beneficial effects on reducing delays in the national airspace system as a whole.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Eligibility of Air Carriers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier or foreign air carrier operating at an airport selected to participate in the pilot program is eligible to participate in the pilot program if the Administrator determines that the carrier has the operational and communications capability to participate in the pilot program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Modification or Termination of Pilot Program at an Airport</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, may modify or end the pilot program at an airport before the term of the pilot program has expired, or may ban an air carrier or foreign air carrier from participating in the program, if the Administrator determines that the purpose of the pilot program is not being furthered by participation of the airport or air carrier or if the Secretary of Transportation, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, finds that the pilot program or the participation of an air carrier or foreign air carrier in the pilot program has had, or is having, an adverse effect on competition among carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Antitrust Immunity.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Unless, within 5 days after receiving notice from the Secretary of the Secretary's intention to exercise authority under this subsection, the Attorney General submits to the Secretary a written objection to such action, including reasons for such objection, the Secretary may exempt an air carrier's or foreign air carrier's activities that are necessary to participate in the pilot program under this section from the antitrust laws for the sole purpose of participating in the pilot program. Such exemption shall not extend to any discussions, agreements, or activities outside the scope of the pilot program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Antitrust laws defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;antitrust laws&rdquo; has the meaning given that term in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Consultation With Attorney General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall consult with the Attorney General regarding the design and implementation of the pilot program, including determining whether a limit should be set on the number of occasions collaborative decisionmaking could be employed during the initial 2-year period of the pilot program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Evaluation.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before the expiration of the 2-year period for which the pilot program is authorized under subsection (b), the Administrator shall determine whether the pilot program has facilitated more effective use of air traffic capacity and the Secretary, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, shall determine whether the pilot program has had an adverse effect on airline competition or the availability of air services to communities. The Administrator shall also examine whether capacity benefits resulting from the participation in the pilot program of an airport resulted in capacity benefits to other parts of the national airspace system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Obtaining necessary data</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may require participating air carriers and airports to provide data necessary to evaluate the pilot program's impact.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Extension of Pilot Program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At the end of the 2-year period for which the pilot program is authorized, the Administrator, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, may continue the pilot program for an additional 2 years and expand participation in the program to up to 7 additional airports if the Administrator determines pursuant to subsection (j) that the pilot program has facilitated more effective use of air traffic capacity and if the Secretary, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, determines that the pilot program has had no adverse effect on airline competition or the availability of air services to communities. The Administrator shall select the additional airports to participate in the extended pilot program in the same manner in which airports were initially selected to participate.</p>
