<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Decisions Made Before October</cap-smallcap> 1, 1988.&mdash;For each eligible place for which a decision was made before October 1, 1988, under section 419 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, establishing the level of essential air transportation, the level of basic essential air service for that place shall be the level established by the Secretary of Transportation for that place by not later than December 29, 1988.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Decisions Not Made Before October</cap-smallcap> 1, 1988.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall decide on the level of basic essential air service for each eligible place for which a decision was not made before October 1, 1988, establishing the level of essential air transportation, when the Secretary receives notice that service to that place will be provided by only one air carrier. The Secretary shall make the decision by the last day of the 6-month period beginning on the date the Secretary receives the notice. The Secretary may impose notice requirements necessary to carry out this subsection. Before making a decision, the Secretary shall consider the views of any interested community and the appropriate State authority of the State in which the community is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Until the Secretary has made a decision on a level of basic essential air service for an eligible place under this subsection, the Secretary, on petition by an appropriate representative of the place, shall prohibit an air carrier from ending, suspending, or reducing air transportation to that place that appears to deprive the place of basic essential air service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Availability of Compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Secretary decides that basic essential air service will not be provided to an eligible place without compensation, the Secretary shall provide notice that an air carrier may apply to provide basic essential air service to the place for compensation under this section.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the preferences of the actual and potential users of air transportation at the eligible place, giving substantial weight to the views of the elected officials representing the users; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) for an eligible place in Alaska, the experience of the applicant in providing, in Alaska, scheduled air service, or significant patterns of non-scheduled air service under an exemption granted under section 40109(a) and (c)&ndash;(h) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under guidelines prescribed under section 41737(a) of this title, the Secretary shall pay the rate of compensation for providing basic essential air service under this section and section 41734 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Compensation Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall pay compensation under this section at times and in the way the Secretary decides is appropriate.

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Notice Required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier may end, suspend, or reduce air transportation to an eligible place below the level of basic essential air service established for that place under section 41733 of this title only after giving the Secretary of Transportation, the appropriate State authority, and the affected communities at least 90 days&rsquo; notice before ending, suspending, or reducing that transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Continuation of Service for</cap-smallcap> 30 <cap-smallcap>Days After Notice Period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If at the end of the notice period under subsection (a) of this section the Secretary has not found another air carrier to provide basic essential air service to the eligible place, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing notice to continue to provide basic essential air service to the place for an additional 30-day period or until another carrier begins to provide basic essential air service to the place, whichever occurs first.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Continuation of Service for Additional</cap-smallcap> 30-<cap-smallcap>Day Periods</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If at the end of the 30-day period under subsection (b) of this section the Secretary decides another air carrier will not provide basic essential air service to the place on a continuing basis, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing service to continue to provide service for additional 30-day periods until another carrier begins providing service on a continuing basis. At the end of each 30-day period, the Secretary shall decide if another carrier will provide service on a continuing basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Continuation of Compensation After Notice Period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If an air carrier receiving compensation under section 41733 of this title for providing basic essential air service to an eligible place is required to continue to provide service to the place under this section after the 90-day notice period under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall continue to pay that compensation after the last day of that period. The Secretary shall pay the compensation until the Secretary finds another carrier to provide the service to the place or the 90th day after the end of that notice period, whichever is earlier. If, after the 90th day after the end of the 90-day notice period, the Secretary has not found another carrier to provide the service, the carrier required to continue to provide that service shall receive compensation sufficient&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to pay for the fully allocated actual cost to the carrier of performing the basic essential air service that was being provided when the 90-day notice was given under subsection (a) of this section plus a reasonable return on investment that is at least 5 percent of operating costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide the carrier an additional return that recognizes the demonstrated additional lost profits from opportunities foregone and the likelihood that those lost profits increase as the period during which the carrier is required to provide the service continues.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide the carrier an additional return that recognizes the demonstrated additional lost profits from opportunities foregone and the likelihood that those lost profits increase as the period during which the carrier is required to provide the service continues.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Finding Replacement Carriers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the Secretary requires an air carrier to continue to provide basic essential air service to an eligible place, the Secretary shall continue to make every effort to find another carrier to provide at least that basic essential air service to the place on a continuing basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Transfer of Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If an air carrier, providing basic essential air service under section 41733 of this title between an eligible place and an airport at which the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration limits the number of instrument flight rule takeoffs and landings of aircraft, provides notice under subsection (a) of this section of an intention to end, suspend, or reduce that service and another carrier is found to provide the service, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing notice to transfer any operational authority the carrier has to land or take off at that airport related to the service to the eligible place to the carrier that will provide the service, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the carrier that will provide the service needs the authority; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the authority to be transferred is being used to provide air service to another eligible place.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Nonconsideration of Slot Availability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining what is basic essential air service and in selecting an air carrier to provide such service, the Secretary shall not consider as a factor whether slots at a high density airport are available for providing such service.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Proposals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A State or local government may submit a proposal to the Secretary of Transportation for enhanced essential air service to an eligible place for which basic essential air service is being provided under section 41733 of this title.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specify the level and type of enhanced essential air service the State or local government considers appropriate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) include an agreement related to compensation required for the proposed service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The agreement submitted under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall provide that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) the Government pay 100 percent of the compensation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if the proposed service is not successful for at least a 2-year period under the criteria prescribed by the Secretary under paragraph (3) of this subsection, the eligible place is not eligible for air service or air transportation for which compensation is paid by the Secretary under this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation objective criteria for deciding whether enhanced essential air service to an eligible place under this section is successful in terms of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) increasing passenger usage of the airport facilities at the place; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) reducing the amount of compensation provided by the Secretary under this subchapter for that service.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Compensation Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall pay compensation under this section when and in the way the Secretary decides is appropriate. Compensation for enhanced essential air service under this section may be paid only for the costs incurred in providing air service to an eligible place that are in addition to the costs incurred in providing basic essential air service to the place under section 41733 of this title. The Secretary shall continue to pay compensation under this section only as long as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the air carrier maintains the level of enhanced essential air service;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall review periodically the enhanced essential air service provided to each eligible place under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For service for which the Government pays 50 percent of the compensation, based on the review and consultation with the affected community and the State or local government or person paying the remaining 50 percent of the compensation, the Secretary shall make appropriate adjustments in the type and level of service to the place.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For service for which the Government pays 100 percent of the compensation, based on the review and consultation with the State or local government submitting the proposal, the Secretary shall decide whether the service has succeeded for at least a 2-year period under the criteria prescribed under subsection (a)(3) of this section. If unsuccessful, the place is not eligible for air service or air transportation for which compensation is paid by the Secretary under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Ending, Suspending, and Reducing Air Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier may end, suspend, or reduce air transportation to an eligible place below the level of enhanced essential air service established for that place by the Secretary under this section only after giving the Secretary, the affected community, and the State or local government or person paying compensation for that service at least 30 days&rsquo; notice before ending, suspending, or reducing the service. This subsection does not relieve the carrier of an obligation under section 41734 of this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Proposals and Decisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A State or local government may propose to the Secretary of Transportation that the Secretary provide compensation to an air carrier to provide air transportation to a place that is not an eligible place under this subchapter. Not later than 90 days after receiving a proposal under this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) decide whether to designate the place as eligible to receive compensation under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) approve the proposal if the State or local government or a person is willing and able to pay 50 percent of the compensation for providing the transportation, and notify the State or local government of the approval; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) disapprove the proposal if the Secretary decides the proposal is not reasonable under paragraph (2) of this subsection, and notify the State or local government of the disapproval and the reasons for the disapproval.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In deciding whether a proposal is reasonable, the Secretary shall consider, among other factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the traffic-generating potential of the place;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the cost to the United States Government of providing the proposed transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the distance of the place from the closest hub airport.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Approval for Certain Air Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, the Secretary shall approve a proposal under this section to compensate an air carrier for providing air transportation to a place in the 48 contiguous States or the District of Columbia and designate the place as eligible for compensation under this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) at any time before October 23, 1978, the place was served by a carrier holding a certificate under section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the place is more than 50 miles from the nearest small hub airport or an eligible place;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the place is more than 150 miles from the nearest hub airport; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the State or local government submitting the proposal or a person is willing and able to pay 25 percent of the cost of providing the compensated transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Paragraph (4) does not apply to any community approved for service under this section during the period beginning October 1, 1991, and ending December 31, 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Level of Air Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Secretary designates a place under subsection (a)(1) of this section as eligible for compensation under this section, the Secretary shall decide, not later than 6 months after the date of the designation, on the level of air transportation to be provided under this section. Before making a decision, the Secretary shall consider the views of any interested community, the appropriate State authority of the State in which the place is located, and the State or local government or person agreeing to pay compensation for the transportation under subsection (b)(4) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After making the decision under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall provide notice that any air carrier that is willing to provide the level of air transportation established under paragraph (1) for a place may submit an application to provide the transportation. In selecting an applicant, the Secretary shall consider, among other factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the factors listed in section 41733(c)(1) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the views of the State or local government or person agreeing to pay compensation for the transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Compensation Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall pay compensation under this section when and in the way the Secretary decides is appropriate. The Secretary shall continue to pay compensation under this section only as long as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the air carrier maintains the level of air transportation established by the Secretary under subsection (c)(1) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the State or local government or person agreeing to pay compensation for transportation under this section continues to pay that compensation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary decides the compensation is necessary to maintain the transportation to the place.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may require the State or local government or person agreeing to pay compensation under this section to make advance payments or provide other security to ensure that timely payments are made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall review periodically the level of air transportation provided <!-- PDFPage:659 -->under this section. Based on the review and consultation with any interested community, the appropriate State authority of the State in which the community is located, and the State or local government or person paying compensation under this section, the Secretary may make appropriate adjustments in the level of transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Withdrawal of Eligibility Designations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After providing notice and an opportunity for interested persons to comment, the Secretary may withdraw the designation of a place under subsection (a)(1) of this section as eligible to receive compensation under this section if the place has received air transportation under this section for at least 2 years and the Secretary decides the withdrawal would be in the public interest. The Secretary by regulation shall prescribe standards for deciding whether the withdrawal of a designation under this subsection is in the public interest. The standards shall include the factors listed in subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Ending, Suspending, and Reducing Air Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier providing air transportation for compensation under this section may end, suspend, or reduce that transportation below the level of transportation established by the Secretary under this section only after giving the Secretary, the affected community, and the State or local government or person paying compensation under this section at least 30 days&rsquo; notice before ending, suspending, or reducing the transportation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Compensation Guidelines</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe guidelines governing the rate of compensation payable under this subchapter.

The guidelines shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide for a reduction in compensation when an air carrier does not provide service or transportation agreed to be provided;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) consider amounts needed by an air carrier to promote public use of the service or transportation for which compensation is being paid; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) include expense elements based on representative costs of air carriers providing scheduled air transportation of passengers, property, and mail on aircraft of the type the Secretary decides is appropriate for providing the service or transportation for which compensation is being provided.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Promotional amounts described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall be a special, segregated element of the compensation provided to a carrier under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Required Finding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may pay compensation to an air carrier for providing air service or air transportation under this subchapter only if the Secretary finds the carrier is able to provide the service or transportation in a reliable way.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Claims</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 15 days after receiving a written claim from an air carrier for compensation under this subchapter, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if denying the claim, notify the carrier of the denial and the reasons for the denial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Make Agreements and Incur Obligations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may <!-- PDFPage:660 -->make agreements and incur obligations from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund established under section 9502 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 9502) to pay compensation under this subchapter. An agreement by the Secretary under this subsection is a contractual obligation of the Government to pay the Government's share of the compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not more than $38,600,000 is available to the Secretary out of the Fund for each of the fiscal years ending September 30, 1993&ndash;1998, to incur obligations under this section. Amounts made available under this section remain available until expended.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Criteria for Participation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In selecting communities, or consortia of communities, for participation in the program established under subsection (a), the Secretary shall apply the following criteria:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Size</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For calendar year 1997, the airport serving the community or consortium was not larger than a small hub airport (as that term is defined in section 41731(a)(5)), and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) had insufficient air carrier service; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) had unreasonably high air fares.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Characteristics</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The airport presents characteristics, such as geographic diversity or unique circumstances, that will demonstrate the need for, and feasibility of, the program established under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>State limit</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No more than four communities or consortia of communities, or a combination thereof, may be located in the same State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Overall limit</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No more than 40 communities or consortia of communities, or a combination thereof, may be selected to participate in the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Priorities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall give priority to communities or consortia of communities where&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) air fares are higher than the average air fares for all communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the community or consortium will provide a portion of the cost of the activity to be assisted under the program from local sources other than airport revenues;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the community or consortium has established, or will establish, a public-private partnership to facilitate air carrier service to the public; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the assistance will provide material benefits to a broad segment of the travelling public, including business, educational institutions, and other enterprises, whose access to the national air transportation system is limited.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Types of Assistance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may use amounts made available under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide assistance to an air carrier to subsidize service to and from an underserved airport for a period not to exceed 3 years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide assistance to an underserved airport to obtain service to and from the underserved airport; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide assistance to an underserved airport to implement such other measures as the Secretary, in consultation with such airport, considers appropriate to improve air service both in terms of the cost of such service to consumers and the availability of such service, including improving air service through marketing and promotion of air service and enhanced utilization of airport facilities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Authorization of appropriations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 and $27,500,000 for each of fiscal years 2002 and 2003 to carry out this section. Such sums shall remain available until expended.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Additional Action</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Under the pilot program established under subsection (a), the Secretary shall work with air carriers providing <!-- PDFPage:663 -->service to participating communities and major air carriers (as defined in section 41716(a)(2)) serving large hub airports (as defined in section 41731(a)(3)) to facilitate joint-fare arrangements consistent with normal industry practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Designation of Responsible Official</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall designate an employee of the Department of Transportation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to function as a facilitator between small communities and air carriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to carry out this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to ensure that the Bureau of Transportation Statistics collects data on passenger information to assess the service needs of small communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to work with and coordinate efforts with other Federal, State, and local agencies to increase the viability of service to small communities and the creation of aviation development zones; and</p>
