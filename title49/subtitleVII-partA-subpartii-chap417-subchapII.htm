<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Decisions Made Before October</cap-smallcap> 1, 1988.&mdash;For each eligible place for which a decision was made before October 1, 1988, under section 419 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, establishing the level of essential air transportation, the level of basic essential air service for that place shall be the level established by the Secretary of Transportation for that place by not later than December 29, 1988.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Decisions Not Made Before October</cap-smallcap> 1, 1988.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall decide on the level of basic essential air service for each eligible place for which a decision was not made before October 1, 1988, establishing the level of essential air transportation, when the Secretary receives notice that service to that place will be provided by only one air carrier. The Secretary shall make the decision by the last day of the 6-month period beginning on the date the Secretary receives the notice. The Secretary may impose notice requirements necessary to carry out this subsection. Before making a decision, the Secretary shall consider the views of any interested community and the appropriate State authority of the State in which the community is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Until the Secretary has made a decision on a level of basic essential air service for an eligible place under this subsection, the Secretary, on petition by an appropriate representative of the place, shall prohibit an air carrier from ending, suspending, or reducing air transportation to that place that appears to deprive the place of basic essential air service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Availability of Compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Secretary decides that basic essential air service will not be provided to an eligible place without compensation, the Secretary shall provide notice that an air carrier may apply to provide basic essential air service to the place for compensation under this section. In selecting an applicant, the Secretary shall consider, among other factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the demonstrated reliability of the applicant in providing scheduled air service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the contractual and marketing arrangements the applicant has made with a larger <!-- PDFPage:823 -->carrier to ensure service beyond the hub airport;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the interline arrangements that the applicant has made with a larger carrier to allow passengers and cargo of the applicant at the hub airport to be transported by the larger carrier through one reservation, ticket, and baggage check-in;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the preferences of the actual and potential users of air transportation at the eligible place, giving substantial weight to the views of the elected officials representing the users; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) for an eligible place in Alaska, the experience of the applicant in providing, in Alaska, scheduled air service, or significant patterns of non-scheduled air service under an exemption granted under section 40109(a) and (c)&ndash;(h) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under guidelines prescribed under section 41737(a) of this title, the Secretary shall pay the rate of compensation for providing basic essential air service under this section and section 41734 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Compensation Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall pay compensation under this section at times and in the way the Secretary decides is appropriate. The Secretary shall end payment of compensation to an air carrier for providing basic essential air service to an eligible place when the Secretary decides the compensation is no longer necessary to maintain basic essential air service to the place.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall review periodically the level of basic essential air service for each eligible place. Based on the review and consultations with an interested community and the appropriate State authority of the State in which the community is located, the Secretary may make appropriate adjustments in the level of service, to the extent such adjustments are to a level not less than the basic essential air service level established under subsection (a) for the airport that serves the community.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Notice Required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier may end, suspend, or reduce air transportation to an eligible place below the level of basic essential air service established for that place under section 41733 of this title only after giving the Secretary of Transportation, the appropriate State authority, and the affected communities at least 90 days&rsquo; notice before ending, suspending, or reducing that transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Continuation of Service for</cap-smallcap> 30 <cap-smallcap>Days After Notice Period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If at the end of the notice period under subsection (a) of this section the Secretary has not found another air carrier to provide basic essential air service to the eligible place, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing notice to continue to provide basic essential air service to the place for an ad<!-- PDFPage:824 -->ditional 30-day period or until another carrier begins to provide basic essential air service to the place, whichever occurs first.</p>

At the end of each 30-day period, the Secretary shall decide if another carrier will provide service on a continuing basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Continuation of Compensation After Notice Period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If an air carrier receiving compensation under section 41733 of this title for providing basic essential air service to an eligible place is required to continue to provide service to the place under this section after the 90-day notice period under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall continue to pay that compensation after the last day of that period.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Nonconsideration of Slot Availability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining what is basic essential air service and in selecting an air carrier to provide such service, the Secretary shall not consider as a factor whether slots at a high density airport are available for providing such service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Exemption From Hold-In Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, after the date of enactment of this subsection, an air carrier commences air transportation to an eligible place that is not receiving scheduled passenger air service as a result of the failure of the eligible place to meet requirements contained in an appropriations Act, the air carrier shall not be subject to the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) with respect to such air transportation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Level of Air Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Secretary designates a place under subsection <!-- PDFPage:827 -->(a)(1) of this section as eligible for compensation under this section, the Secretary shall decide, not later than 6 months after the date of the designation, on the level of air transportation to be provided under this section.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) After making the decision under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall provide notice that any air carrier that is willing to provide the level of air transportation established under paragraph (1) for a place may submit an application to provide the transportation.

Based on the review and consultation with any interested community, the appropriate State authority of the State in which the community is located, and the State or local government or person paying compensation under this section, the Secretary may make appropriate adjustments in the level of transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Withdrawal of Eligibility Designations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After providing notice and an opportunity for interested persons to comment, the Secretary may withdraw the designation of a place under subsection (a)(1) of this section as eligible to receive compensation under this section if the place has received air transportation under this section for at least 2 years and the Secretary decides the withdrawal would be in the public interest.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Compensation Guidelines</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe guidelines governing the rate of compensation payable under this subchapter. The guidelines shall be used to determine the reasonable amount of compensation required to ensure the continuation of air service or air transportation under this subchapter. The guidelines shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide for a reduction in compensation when an air carrier does not provide service or transportation agreed to be provided;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) consider amounts needed by an air carrier to promote public use of the service or transportation for which compensation is being paid; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) include expense elements based on representative costs of air carriers providing scheduled air transportation of passengers, property, and mail on aircraft of the type the Secretary decides is appropriate for providing the service or transportation for which compensation is being provided.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Promotional amounts described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall be a special, segregated element of the compensation provided to a carrier under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Required Finding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may pay compensation to an air carrier for providing air service or air transportation under this subchapter only if the Secretary finds the carrier is able to provide the service or transportation in a reliable way.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Claims</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 15 days after receiving a written claim from an air carrier for compensation under this subchapter, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) pay or deny the United States Government's share of a claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if denying the claim, notify the carrier of the denial and the reasons for the denial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Make Agreements and Incur Obligations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may make agreements and incur obligations from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund established under section 9502 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 9502) to pay compensation under this subchapter. An agreement by the Secretary under this subsection is a contractual obligation of the Government to pay the Government's share of the compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not more than $38,600,000 is available to the Secretary out of the Fund for each of the fiscal years ending September 30, 1993&ndash;1998, to incur obligations under this section. Amounts made available under this section remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Adjustments to Account for Significantly Increased Costs.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary determines that air carriers are experiencing significantly increased costs in providing air service or air transportation for which compensation is being paid under this subchapter, the Secretary may increase the rates of compensation payable under this subchapter without regard to any agreement or requirement relating to the renegotiation of contracts or any notice requirement under section 41734.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Readjustment if costs subsequently decline</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If an adjustment is made under paragraph (1), and total unit costs subsequently decrease to at least the total unit cost reflected in the compensation rate, then the Secretary may reverse the adjustment previously made under paragraph (1) without regard to any agreement or requirement relating to the renegotiation of contracts or any notice requirement under section 41734.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Significantly increased costs defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this subsection, the term &ldquo;significantly increased costs&rdquo; means a total unit cost increase (but not increases in individual unit costs) of 10 percent or more in relation to the total unit cost reflected in the compensation rate, based on the carrier's internal audit of its financial statements if such cost increase is incurred for a period of at least 2 consecutive months.</p>
