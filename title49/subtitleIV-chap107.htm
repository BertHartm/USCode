<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10701. Standards for rates, classifications, through routes, rules, and practices</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A rate (other than a rail rate), classification, rule, or practice related to transportation or service provided by a carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under chapter 105 of this title must be reasonable. A through route established by such a carrier (including a rail carrier) must be reasonable. Divisions of joint rates by those carriers (including rail carriers) must be made without unreasonable discrimination against a participating carrier and must be reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">[(b) Repealed. Pub. L. 96&ndash;448, title II, &sect;201(b)(2), Oct. 14, 1980, 94 Stat. 1900.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I or III of chapter 105 of this title may not discriminate in its rates against a connecting line of another carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under either of those subchapters or unreasonably discriminate against that line in the distribution of traffic that is not routed specifically by the shipper.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In a proceeding to determine whether a rate for transportation or service provided by a common carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II, III, or IV of chapter 105 of this title complies with subsection (a) of this section, the good will, earning power, or certificate or permit under which that carrier is operating may not be considered or admitted as evidence of the value of the property of that carrier. When the carrier receives a certificate or permit under chapter 109 of this title, it is considered to have agreed to this subsection for itself and for all transferees of that certificate or permit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Except as provided in subsection (f), in proceedings to determine the reasonableness of rate levels for a motor carrier or group of motor carriers, or in proceedings to determine the reasonableness of a territorial rate structure where rates are proposed through agreements authorized by section 10706(b) of this title, the Commission shall authorize revenue levels that are adequate under honest, economical, and efficient management to cover total operating expenses, including the operation of leased equipment and depreciation, plus a reasonable profit. The standards and procedures adopted by the Commission under this subsection shall allow the carriers to achieve revenue levels that will provide a flow of net income, plus depreciation, adequate to support prudent capital outlays, assure the repayment of a reasonable level of debt, permit the raising of needed equity capital, attract and retain capital in amounts adequate to provide a sound motor carrier transportation system in the United States, and take into account reasonable estimated or foreseeable future costs. Any complaint brought against a motor carrier (other than a carrier described in subsection (f)(1)(A)) by a person (other than a motor carrier) for unreasonably high rates for past or future transportation shall be determined under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Procedures for Resolving Claims Involving Unfiled, Negotiated Transportation Rates.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a claim is made by a motor carrier of property (other than a household goods carrier) providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title, by a freight forwarder (other than a household goods freight forwarder), or by a party representing such a carrier or freight forwarder regarding the collection of rates or charges for such transportation in addition to those originally billed and collected by the carrier or freight forwarder for such transportation, the person against whom the claim is made may elect to satisfy the claim under the provisions of paragraph (2), (3), or (4) of this subsection, upon showing that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the carrier or freight forwarder is no longer transporting property or is transporting property for the purpose of avoiding the application of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with respect to the claim&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the person was offered a transportation rate by the carrier or freight forwarder other than that legally on file with the Commission for the transportation service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the person tendered freight to the carrier or freight forwarder in reasonable reliance upon the offered transportation rate;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:217 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the carrier or freight forwarder did not properly or timely file with the Commission a tariff providing for such transportation rate or failed to enter into an agreement for contract carriage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) such transportation rate was billed and collected by the carrier or freight forwarder; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the carrier or freight forwarder demands additional payment of a higher rate filed in a tariff.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If there is a dispute as to the showing under subparagraph (A), such dispute shall be resolved by the court in which the claim is brought. If there is a dispute as to the showing under subparagraph (B), such dispute shall be resolved by the Commission. Pending the resolution of any such dispute, the person shall not have to pay any additional compensation to the carrier or freight forwarder. Satisfaction of the claim under paragraph (2), (3), or (4) of this subsection shall be binding on the parties, and the parties shall not be subject to chapter 119 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Claims involving shipments weighing 10,000 pounds or less</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person from whom the additional legally applicable and effective tariff rate or charges are sought may elect to satisfy the claim if the shipments each weighed 10,000 pounds or less, by payment of 20 percent of the difference between the carrier's applicable and effective tariff rate and the rate originally billed and paid. In the event that a dispute arises as to the rate that was legally applicable to the shipment, such dispute shall be resolved by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Claims involving shipments weighing more than 10,000 pounds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person from whom the additional legally applicable and effective tariff rate or charges are sought may elect to satisfy the claim if the shipments each weighed more than 10,000 pounds, by payment of 15 percent of the difference between the carrier's applicable and effective tariff rate and the rate originally billed and paid. In the event that a dispute arises as to the rate that was legally applicable to the shipment, such dispute shall be resolved by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Claims involving public warehousemen</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), a person from whom the additional legally applicable and effective tariff rate or charges are sought may elect to satisfy the claim by payment of 5 percent of the difference between the carrier's applicable and effective tariff rate and the rate originally billed and paid if such person is a public warehouseman. In the event that a dispute arises as to the rate that was legally applicable to the shipment, such dispute shall be resolved by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Effects of election</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a person from whom additional legally applicable freight rates or charges are sought does not elect to use the provisions of paragraph (2), (3), or (4), the person may pursue all rights and remedies existing under this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <cap-smallcap>Stay of additional compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a person proceeds under this section to challenge the reasonableness of the legally applicable freight rate or charges being claimed by a carrier or freight forwarder described in paragraph (1) in addition to those already billed and collected, the person shall not have to pay any additional compensation to the carrier or freight forwarder until the Commission has made a determination as to the reasonableness of the challenged rate as applied to the freight of the person against whom the claim is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on statutory construction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as authorized in paragraphs (2), (3), (4), and (9) of this subsection, nothing in this subsection shall relieve a motor common carrier of the duty to file and adhere to its rates, rules, and classifications as required in sections 10761 and 10762 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) <cap-smallcap>Notification of election.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>General rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person must notify the carrier or freight forwarder as to its election to proceed under paragraph (2), (3), or (4). Except as provided in subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D), such election may be made at any time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Demands for payment initially made after date of enactment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the carrier or freight forwarder or party representing such carrier or freight forwarder initially demands the payment of additional freight charges after the date of the enactment of this subsection and notifies the person from whom additional freight charges are sought of the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (7) at the time of the making of such initial demand, the election must be made not later than the later of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the 90th day following the date of the enactment of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Pending suits for collection made before or on date of enactment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the carrier or freight forwarder or party representing such carrier or freight forwarder has filed, before or on the date of the enactment of this subsection, a suit for the collection of additional freight charges and notifies the person from whom additional freight charges are sought of the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (7), the election must be made not later than the 90th day following the date on which such notification is received.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Demands for payment made before or on date of enactment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the carrier or freight forwarder or party representing such carrier or freight forwarder has demanded the payment of additional freight charges, and has not filed a suit for the collection of such additional freight charges, before or on the date of the enactment of this subsection and notifies the person from whom additional freight charges are sought of the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (7), the election must be made not later than the later of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) or (c) of this section and unless a rate is prohibited by a provision of this title, a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may establish any rate for transportation or other service provided by the carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) If the Commission determines, under section 10709 of this title, that a rail carrier has market dominance over the transportation to which a particular rate applies, the rate established by such carrier for such transportation must be reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any proceeding to determine the reasonableness of a rate described in paragraph (1) of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the shipper challenging such rate shall have the burden of proving that such rate is not reasonable if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such rate (I) is authorized under section 10707a of this title, and (II) results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for the transportation to which the rate applies that is less than the lesser of the percentages described in clauses (i) and (ii) of section 10707a(e)(2)(A) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such rate does not meet the description set forth in clause (i) of this subparagraph, but the Commission does not begin an investigation proceeding under section 10707 of this title to determine whether such rate is reasonable; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the rail carrier establishing the challenged rate shall have the burden of proving that such rate is reasonable if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such rate (I) is greater than that authorized under section 10707a of this title, or (II) results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for the transportation to which the rate applies that is equal to or greater than the lesser of the percentages described in clauses (i) and (ii) of section 10707a(e)(2)(A) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the Commission begins an investigation proceeding under section 10707 of this title to determine whether such rate is reasonable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In determining whether a rate established by a rail carrier is reasonable for purposes of this section, the Commission shall recognize the policy of this subtitle that rail carriers shall earn adequate revenues, as established by the Commission under section 10704(a)(2) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A rate for transportation or other service provided by a rail carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may not be established below a reasonable minimum. Any rate for transportation by such a rail carrier that does not contribute to the going concern value of such carrier is presumed to be not reasonable. A rate that contributes to the going concern value of such carrier is conclusively presumed not to be below a reasonable minimum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A rate for transportation by a rail carrier that equals or exceeds the variable cost of providing the transportation is conclusively presumed to contribute to the going concern value of such rail carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Upon the filing of a complaint alleging that a rate is in violation of this subsection, the Commission shall take final action thereon by the 90th day after the date such complaint is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission determines, based on the record after opportunity for a hearing, that a rate is in violation of this subsection, the Commission shall order such rate to be raised, but only to the minimum level required by this subsection. The complainant shall have the burden of proving that such rate is in violation of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) For purposes of this subsection, variable costs shall be determined under formulas or procedures prescribed or certified by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the determination of variable costs for purposes of minimum rate regulation, the Commission shall, on application of the rail carrier proposing the rate, determine only the costs of such carrier and only those costs of the specific service in question unless the specific information is not available. The Commission may not include in such variable costs an expense that does not vary directly with the level of transportation provided under the proposed rate.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10704. Authority and criteria: rates, classifications, rules, and practices prescribed by Interstate Commerce Commission</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) When the Interstate Commerce Commission, after a full hearing, decides that a rate <!-- PDFPage:224 -->charged or collected by a carrier for transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, or that a classification, rule, or practice of that carrier, does or will violate this subtitle, the Commission may prescribe the rate (including a maximum or minimum rate, or both), classification, rule, or practice to be followed. The Commission may order the carrier to stop the violation. When a rate, classification, rule, or practice is prescribed under this subsection, the affected carrier may not publish, charge, or collect a different rate and shall adopt the classification and observe the rule or practice prescribed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall maintain and revise as necessary standards and procedures for establishing revenue levels for rail carriers providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under that subchapter that are adequate, under honest, economical, and efficient management, to cover total operating expenses, including depreciation and obsolescence, plus a reasonable and economic profit or return (or both) on capital employed in the business. The Commission shall make an adequate and continuing effort to assist those carriers in attaining revenue levels prescribed under this paragraph. However, a rate, classification, rule, or practice of a rail carrier may be maintained at a particular level to protect the traffic of another carrier or mode of transportation only if the Commission finds that the rate or classification, or rule or practice related to it, reduces or would reduce the going concern value of the carrier charging the rate. Revenue levels established under this paragraph should&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide a flow of net income plus depreciation adequate to support prudent capital outlays, assure the repayment of a reasonable level of debt, permit the raising of needed equity capital, and cover the effects of inflation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) attract and retain capital in amounts adequate to provide a sound transportation system in the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall conclude a proceeding under paragraph (2) of this subsection within 180 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and thereafter as necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) On the basis of the standards and procedures under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Commission shall, within 180 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and on an annual basis thereafter, determine which rail carriers are earning adequate revenues.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) When the Commission decides that a rate charged or collected by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a motor common carrier for providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title by itself, with another motor common carrier, with a rail, express, or water common carrier, or any of them;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a water common carrier for providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under subchapter III of chapter 105 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a household goods freight forwarder for providing service subject to its jurisdiction under subchapter IV of chapter 105 of this title;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">or that a classification, rule, or practice of that carrier, does or will violate this chapter, the Commission shall prescribe the rate (including a maximum or minimum rate, or both), classification, rule, or practice to be followed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) When prescribing a rate, classification, rule, or practice for transportation or service by common carriers other than by rail carrier, the Commission shall consider, among other factors, the effect of the prescribed rate, classification, rule, or practice on the movement of traffic by that carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) When prescribing a rate, classification, rule, or practice for transportation or service by common carriers other than by rail carrier or motor carrier, the Commission shall consider, among other factors, the need for revenues that are sufficient, under honest, economical, and efficient management, to let the carrier provide that transportation or service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the carrier is a motor or water common carrier or a household goods freight forwarder, the Commission shall also consider the need, in the public interest, of adequate and efficient transportation or service by that carrier at the lowest cost consistent with providing that transportation or service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the carrier is a motor common carrier or a household goods freight forwarder, the Commission shall also consider the inherent advantages of transportation by motor common carrier or the inherent nature of household goods freight forwarding, respectively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) When the Commission finds that a minimum rate of a contract carrier for transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II or III of chapter 105 of this title, or a rule or practice related to the rate or the value of the service under it, violates this chapter or the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title, the Commission may prescribe the minimum rate, rule, or practice for the carrier that is desirable in the public interest and will promote that policy. In prescribing the rate, the Commission may not give a motor or water contract carrier an advantage or preference in competition with a motor or water common carrier, respectively, if an advantage or preference is unreasonable or inconsistent with the public interest and the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When prescribing a minimum rate, or rule or practice related to a rate, for a contract carrier, the Commission shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the cost of the transportation provided by the carrier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the effect of a prescribed minimum rate, or rule or practice, on the movement of traffic by that carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In a proceeding involving competition between carriers of different modes of transportation subject to this subtitle, except rail carriers, the Commission, in determining whether a rate is less than a reasonable minimum rate, shall consider the facts and circumstances involved in moving the traffic by the mode of carrier to which the rate is applicable. Subject to the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title, rates of a carrier may not be maintained at a particular level to protect the traffic of another mode of transportation.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:225 --><p class="statutory-body">(e) In a proceeding involving a proposed increase or decrease in rail carrier rates, the Commission shall specifically consider allegations that the increase or decrease would (1) change the rate relationships between commodities, ports, places, regions, areas, or other particular descriptions of traffic (without regard to previous Commission consideration or approval of those relationships), and (2) have a significant adverse effect on the competitive position of shippers or consignees served by the rail carrier proposing the increase or decrease. The Commission shall investigate to determine whether the change or effect violates this subtitle when it finds that those allegations are substantially supported on the record. The investigation may be made either before or after the proposed increase or decrease becomes effective and either in that proceeding or in another proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Commission may begin a proceeding under this section on its own initiative or on complaint. A complaint under subsection (a) of this section must be made under section 11701 of this title, but the proceeding may also be in extension of a complaint pending before the Commission. A complaint under subsection (c) of this section must contain a full statement of the facts and the reasons for the complaint and must be made under oath.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Interstate Commerce Commission may, and shall when it considers it desirable in the public interest, prescribe through routes, joint classifications, joint rates (including maximum or minimum rates or both), the division of joint rates, and the conditions under which those routes must be operated, for a common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I, II (except a motor common carrier of property), or III of chapter 105 of this title.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) inclusion of those lines would make the through route unreasonably long when compared with a practicable alternative through route that could be established; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the Commission decides that the proposed through route is needed to provide adequate, and more efficient or economic, transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall give reasonable preference, subject to this subsection, to the rail carrier originating the traffic when prescribing through routes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission may not prescribe&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a through route, classification, practice, or rate between a street electric passenger railway not engaged in the general business of transporting freight in addition to its passenger and express business and (i) a rail carrier of a different character, or (ii) a water common carrier; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a through route or joint rate applicable to it to assist a participating carrier to meet its financial needs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Interstate Commerce Commission may, and shall when it considers it desirable in the public interest, prescribe through routes, joint classifications, joint rates (including maximum or minimum rates or both), the division of joint rates, and the conditions under which those routes must be operated, for a motor common carrier of property providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title with another such carrier or with a water common carrier of property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may not require a motor common carrier of property, without its consent, to include in a through route substantially less than the entire length of its route and the route of any intermediate carrier which is operated in conjunction and under common management or control with such motor common carrier of property which lies between the termini of such proposed through routes (A) unless inclusion of such routes would make the through route unreasonably circuitous as compared with another practicable through route which could <!-- PDFPage:227 -->otherwise be established, or (B) unless the Commission finds that the through route proposed to be established is needed in order to provide adequate, more efficient, or more economic transportation. In prescribing through routes the Commission shall, so far as is consistent with the public interest, and subject to the preceding sentence, give reasonable preference to the carrier which originates the traffic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission shall prescribe the division of joint rates to be received by a carrier providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under chapter 105 of this title when it decides that a division of joint rates established by the participating carriers under section 10703 of this title, or under a decision of the Commission under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, does or will violate section 10701 of this title. When prescribing the division of joint rates of a rail carrier, water carrier, or motor common carrier of property under this subsection, the Commission shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the efficiency with which the carriers concerned are operated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of revenue required by the carriers to pay their operating expenses and taxes and receive a fair return on the property held and used for transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the importance of the transportation to the public;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) whether a particular participating carrier is an originating, intermediate, or delivering line; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) other circumstances that ordinarily, without regard to the mileage traveled, entitle one carrier to a different proportion of a rate than another carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If a division of a joint rate prescribed under a decision of the Commission is later found to violate section 10701 of this title, the Commission may decide what division would have been reasonable and order adjustment to be made retroactive to the date the complaint was filed, the date the order for an investigation was made, or a later date that the Commission decides is justified. The Commission may make a decision under this paragraph effective as part of its original decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) When the Commission suspends, for investigation, a tariff of a rail carrier, water common carrier, or motor common carrier of property that would cancel a through route, joint rate, or classification without the consent of all carriers that are parties to it or without authorization of the Commission, the carrier proposing the cancellation has the burden of proving that cancellation is consistent with the public interest without regard to subsection (a)(2) of this section. In determining whether a cancellation involving a rail carrier is consistent with the public interest, the Commission shall, to the extent applicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) compare the distance traveled and the average transportation time and expense required using (A) the through route, and (B) alternative routes, between the places served by the through route;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consider any reduction in energy consumption that may result from cancellation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) consider the overall impact of cancellation on the shippers and carriers that are affected by it.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) The Commission may begin a proceeding under subsection (a) or (b) of this section on its own initiative or on complaint. The Commission must complete all evidentiary proceedings to adjust the division of joint rates for transportation by a rail carrier within 9 months after the complaint is filed if the proceeding is brought on complaint or within 18 months after the commencement of a proceeding on the initiative of the Commission. The Commission must take final action by the 180th day after completion of the evidentiary proceedings, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) when the proceeding involves a railroad in reorganization or a contention that the divisions at issue do not cover the variable costs of handling the traffic, the Commission shall give the proceedings preference over all other proceedings and shall take final action at the earliest practicable time, which in no event may exceed 100 days after the completion of the evidentiary proceedings; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in all cases other than those specified in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Commission may decide to extend such a proceeding to permit its fair and expeditious completion, but whenever the Commission decides to extend a proceeding pursuant to this clause, it must report its reasons to Congress.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When a carrier begins a proceeding to adjust the division of joint rates for transportation by a rail carrier under this section by filing a complaint with the Commission, the carrier must also file all of the evidence in support of its position with the complaint and, during the course of the proceeding may only file rebuttal or reply evidence unless otherwise ordered by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) When the Commission receives a notice of intent to begin a proceeding to adjust the division of joint rates for transportation by a rail carrier under this section, the Commission shall allow the party filing the notice the same right to discovery that a party would have on filing a complaint under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) When there is a shortage of equipment, congestion of traffic, or other emergency declared by the Commission, it may prescribe temporary through routes that are desirable in the public interest on its own initiative or on application without regard to subsection (f) of this section, subchapter II of chapter 103 of this title, and subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Any motor common carrier of property who is a party to a through route and joint rate, whether established by such carrier under section 10703 of this title or prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b) of this section, shall promptly pay divisions or make interline settlements, as the case may be, with other carriers which are parties to such through route and joint rate. In the event of undue delinquency in the settlement of such divisions or interline settlements, such through routes and joint rates may be suspended or canceled under rules prescribed by the Commission.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10705a. Joint rate surcharges and cancellations</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may publish and apply a surcharge increasing or decreasing the through charge applicable to any movement between points designated by the surcharging carrier subject to a joint rate. Such a surcharge may be applied without the concurrence of the other carriers that are party in such joint rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A carrier earning adequate revenues, as determined under section 10704(a)(2) of this title, may not apply such a surcharge to any movement on a line operated by such carrier which carried more than 3,000,000 gross ton miles of traffic per mile in the preceding calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any surcharge applied pursuant to this subsection must be applied in equal dollar amounts to the movement subject to the surcharge over all routes between the points designated by the surcharging carrier which such carrier participates in under the joint rate involved, and when the surcharge increases the through charges, under any of such carrier's single line rates between the same points.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Whenever a rail carrier applies a surcharge increasing a through charge pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, any other rail carrier that participates in any movement subject to such surcharge may cancel the application of such surcharge to any route participated in by such other carrier, if such carrier makes the demonstration described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A rail carrier may cancel the application of a surcharge under this paragraph if such carrier demonstrates to the Commission that the surcharging carrier's share of the revenues, at the time the surcharge was filed with the Commission, from its participation in the movement over the route involved would have been equal to or greater than 110 percent of its variable costs of providing service over such route, under either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the applicable joint rate in effect at the time the surcharge was filed with the Commission, without the surcharge;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a new rate division increasing the share of the surcharging carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) a new higher lawful rate published by the canceling carrier; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) a new, lesser surcharge which shall be prescribed by the Commission upon and in conformity with the request of the carrier proposing to cancel the surcharge. Any such prescribed surcharge shall, in conjunction with the surcharging carrier's division of the joint rate in effect on the date the original surcharge was filed with the Commission, provide the carrier proposing the original surcharge revenues equal to or greater than 110 percent of such surcharging carrier's variable cost of providing service over such route.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) The canceling tariff shall only become effective if the rail carrier proposing to cancel the application of the surcharge makes the demonstration described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the demonstration described in clause (i) of this subparagraph is made on the basis of the applicable joint rate in effect at the time the surcharge was filed with the Commission, without the surcharge, the tariff shall become effective on one day's notice after such determination is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If the demonstration described in clause (i) of this subparagraph is made on the basis of a new rate, division, or surcharge prescribed pursuant to subparagraph (B)(iv) of this paragraph, the tariff shall become effective on the date such new rate, division, or surcharge becomes effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The remedy available to a rail carrier canceling the application of a surcharge under this paragraph shall be in addition to any other remedy available to such carrier under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Commission may cancel the application of a surcharge to a route to which such surcharge applies if a shipper moving traffic over such route demonstrates to the Commission that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) there is no competitive alternative to such route for the movement of the traffic involved that is not subject to such surcharge; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission cancels the application of a surcharge to a particular route pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Commission shall determine the level of surcharge which, in conjunction with the surcharging carrier's division of the joint rate in effect at the time the surcharge was filed with the Commission, would equal 110 percent of the surcharging carrier's variable cost of providing service over such route, and shall authorize such carrier immediately to apply such a surcharge without any further proceedings under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A rail carrier may not apply a surcharge under this subsection unless, for the one-year period preceding the surcharge, such carrier has concurred in all rate increases of general applicability applicable to the joint rate to which such surcharge applies and agreed to by all other carriers that are party to such joint rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A rail carrier may not apply a surcharge under this subsection increasing a through charge applicable to a particular movement more than once each calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a rail carrier may, by tariff, reduce the total charges applicable to a movement over any specific joint line or single line route or routes in which such carrier participates, if such reduction does not lower the total charges applicable to such movement to a level that is less than the lowest total charges applicable to the same movement over a competing route. Any such reduction may be made without the concurrence of any other rail carrier, and shall be borne solely by the carrier reducing the charge. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the right of a carrier to reduce rates over routes not in direct competition between the same points with routes to which it has applied a surcharge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a rail carrier not earning adequate revenues, as determined under section 10704(a)(2) of this title, may publish and apply a surcharge applicable to traffic originating or terminating upon any of its lines that carried less than 3,000,000 gross ton miles of traffic per mile in the most recent calendar year for which traffic data is available; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a rail carrier earning adequate revenues, as so determined, may publish and apply a surcharge applicable to traffic originating or terminating upon any of its lines that carried less than 1,000,000 gross ton miles of traffic per mile in such most recent calendar year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such a surcharge may be applied without the concurrence of any rail carrier. Any such surcharge may be allocated, subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this subsection, in different amounts among different movements between different origins and destinations, and shall accrue solely to the surcharging carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A rail carrier may apply a surcharge under this subsection if, prior to the application of such surcharge, that portion of the charges applicable to traffic to and from the line to which the surcharge applies and accruing to the surcharging carrier does not provide such carrier revenues adequate to cover&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 110 percent of such carrier's variable cost of transporting the traffic involved to or from such line; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 100 percent of such carrier's reasonably expected costs of continuing to operate such line, which shall include all costs necessary to sustain service on the line.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission shall, within 120 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, complete a proceeding to define the term &ldquo;reasonably expected costs&rdquo; as used in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. In the interim, the term shall be construed in accordance with Rail Services Planning Office subsidy standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Upon petition of a shipper located upon a line to which a surcharge under this subsection is applied, the Commission may cancel the application of a surcharge under this subsection if such shipper demonstrates to the Commission that, after application of the surcharge, the surcharging carrier's revenues from all traffic originating or terminating upon the line to which the surcharge applies exceed 110 percent of such carrier's variable cost of transporting all traffic to or from such line plus such carrier's reasonably expected costs of continuing to operate such line.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) A rail carrier's revenue from all traffic originating or terminating upon a line shall be presumed to exceed 110 percent of its variable cost of transporting all traffic to or from such line plus its reasonably expected costs of continuing to operate such line if the complaining shipper demonstrates that the carrier is earning revenues from all traffic originating or terminating upon such line that result in a revenue-variable cost percentage that is equal to or greater than the revenue-variable cost percentage applicable in that year under section 10709(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) A surcharging carrier may rebut the presumption set forth in clause (i) of this subparagraph by demonstrating to the Commission that its reasonably expected costs for operating the line to which the surcharge applies exceed the percentage of variable cost set forth in such clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Upon a finding by the Commission that application of the surcharge will produce revenues in excess of 110 percent of the surcharging carrier's variable cost of transporting traffic to or from the line plus its reasonably expected costs for operating the line, the Commission shall determine the level of surcharge which would produce revenues equal to such figure and shall authorize such carrier immediately to apply such surcharges as will generate such revenues without any further proceedings, subject only to the right of a shipper to proceed under paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) A rail carrier may not apply a surcharge under this subsection that results in any shipper being required to bear more than a reasonable proportion of the reasonably expected costs of continuing to operate the line to which such surcharge applies.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:231 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) Upon complaint of a shipper, the Commission shall determine whether the shipper is being required to bear more than a reasonable proportion of the costs described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the Commission finds that a complaining shipper is being required to bear more than a reasonable proportion of the costs described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Commission may reallocate the surcharge among the traffic originating or terminating on the line to which the surcharge applies, but may not order relief which would result in the surcharging carrier earning revenues less than those which the carrier would have earned had the surcharge been applied as filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A shipper may, in a single complaint, seek relief under paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection. In any such complaint, the Commission shall first determine the right to relief under paragraph (3) and shall grant such relief as is appropriate under such paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In any proceeding brought before the Commission challenging the application or amount of a surcharge under this subsection, whether the surcharge is claimed to violate this subsection or some other provision of this chapter, the Commission shall not suspend the application of any such surcharge unless the person filing the verified statement required by section 10707(c) of this title, in addition to the matters required by such section, also makes the demonstration required by paragraph (3)(A) of this subsection. If the demonstration required by such paragraph (3)(A) is made, the Commission may suspend the application of only so much of the surcharge as will produce revenues in excess of the amount so demonstrated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, any prior agreement in effect on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, or any requirement of the Commission, a rail carrier may cancel the application of a joint rate to a through route in which it participates, without the concurrence of any other rail carrier that is a party to such joint rate, unless another rail carrier that participates in such through route or a shipper that has no competitive alternative to such route makes the demonstration described in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The application of a joint rate to a through route may not be canceled under this subsection if a rail carrier that participates in such through route or a shipper that has no competitive alternative to such route from an origin or destination served by such route demonstrates to the Commission that the canceling carrier's share of the revenues, under the joint rate in effect at the time the application of the joint rate is canceled, is equal to or greater than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 110 percent of the canceling carrier's variable cost of providing service over such route; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such lesser percent of the canceling carrier's variable cost as such carrier earns over a competing through route to which application of the joint rate has not been canceled, or over a competing single line route.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) When a complaining party is unable to make the demonstration required by paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Commission may suspend the tariff canceling the joint rate only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a complaining carrier publishes a new rate division or a new higher lawful rate which increases the canceling carrier's share of the revenues over such route to the amount calculated under paragraph (2)(A) or (2)(B) of this subsection, whichever is less; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a complaining carrier or shipper petitions the Commission and the Commission imposes a surcharge, in conformity with such petition, upon the joint rate which will accrue solely to the canceling carrier and which, in conjunction with the canceling carrier's division of the joint rate in effect on the date the tariff canceling the joint rate was filed, will provide the canceling carrier revenues equal to or greater than 110 percent of its variable cost of providing service over such route.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Unless a new rate, division, or surcharge described in this paragraph becomes effective within 120 days after the proposed effective date of the rate cancellation, the canceling tariff shall, nevertheless, become effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the demonstration described in paragraph (2) is made or a new rate, division, or surcharge described in paragraph (3) becomes effective, the tariff canceling the joint rate shall be considered by the Commission in accordance with section 10705 of this title. The existing joint rate or the new rate division, or surcharge, shall remain in effect during the pendency of the Commission's consideration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Whenever the application of a joint rate to a through route is canceled under this subsection and a rate other than a joint rate is or has been published by the canceling carrier to apply to such route, such rate shall thereafter apply in lieu of all other rates (except joint rates subsequently agreed to by such carrier) and any through rate of which such rate is a factor shall divide as the separate factors of such rate are made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of the Commission under section 10705(a) of this title to prescribe joint rates which provide a rail carrier participating in such joint rate revenues equal to or greater than 110 percent of its variable cost of providing service over each route to which such rate applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, any increase or decrease in revenue resulting from the application of a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section, or from the cancellation of the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section, shall accrue solely to or be borne solely by the carrier applying the surcharge or canceling the application of the joint rate, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever a class III rail carrier which participates in a through route to which a surcharge has been applied under subsection (a) of this section by a carrier operating in the same rate territory as such class III carrier demonstrates to the Commission that the application of such surcharge to such route provides, in the absence of any increase in the joint rate in effect on the date the surcharge was filed with the Commission, revenues from traffic moving over such route to such surcharging carrier in excess of 110 percent of its variable costs over such route, such surcharging carrier shall, from <!-- PDFPage:232 -->the date of such demonstration, share those revenues from such route, from the surcharge and the applicable joint rate in effect on the date the surcharge was filed with the Commission, in excess of 110 percent of its variable costs with all class III rail carriers in the same rate territory participating in such route, on the basis of their existing divisions of the joint rate to which the surcharge applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, whenever a rail carrier proposes to apply a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or to cancel the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section and another rail carrier subsequently agrees to a new rate division or a new lawful rate that increases the surcharging or canceling carrier's share of the total through charges for a movement over a particular through route subject to a joint rate, such other rail carrier shall also agree to any other new rate division and new lawful rate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that is proposed within 120 days after the date of the first agreement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that increases the surcharging or canceling carrier's share of the total through charges for movements over a competing through route subject to such joint rate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A rail carrier shall not be required to agree under this subsection to any proposed new division or new rate which would&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) reduce such carrier's share of the total through charges for a movement over any through route to less than (i) 110 percent of its variable costs of providing service over such route, or (ii) such lesser percent of its variable costs as such carrier earns from such movement over a competing through route with respect to which such carrier has agreed to a new division or rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) increase the surcharging or canceling carrier's share of the total through charges for a movement over any through route to an amount in excess of 110 percent of its variable costs of providing service over such route;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) reduce such carrier's share of the total through charges for a movement over any through route by a dollar amount in excess of the greatest dollar reduction which such carrier has agreed to make, for purposes of increasing the surcharging or canceling carrier's share, to its share of the total through charges for a movement over any competing through route; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) reduce such carrier's share of the total through charges for a movement over any through route in an amount in excess of such carrier's pro rata share (based on established divisions for movements over such route) of the increase of the surcharging or canceling carrier's share of the total through charges for movements over such route.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) A rail carrier applying a surcharge or canceling the application of a joint rate under this section shall file a tariff with the Commission in accordance with section 10762 of this title. Such a tariff may not become effective until the expiration of the 45-day period (or such longer period as the filing carrier specifies) beginning on the date such tariff is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Any rail rate to which a surcharge is applied under this section shall be subject to section 10701a and 10709 of this title, and any such surcharge shall constitute a rate increase for purposes of such sections.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of rate regulation under section 10701a of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) only the rail carrier proposing a surcharge under this section shall be required to defend such surcharge; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the reasonableness of the surcharge and the revenues received by the rail carrier proposing the surcharge under the joint rate to which the surcharge applies shall be determined without regard to amount received and services performed by other rail carriers that are party to such joint rate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except as provided in subsection (i), (j), or (k) of this section, if the application of a surcharge or the cancellation of the application of a joint rate under this section is found to constitute a violation of any provision of this subtitle, such violation shall not be ordered remedied in any manner which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) requires the carrier applying a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or canceling the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section to provide service over any route under a rate that provides revenues to such carrier that are less than 110 percent of its variable costs of providing such service; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which requires the carrier applying a surcharge under subsection (b) of this section to provide service over the route to which such surcharge applies in a manner that provides revenues to such carrier that are less than 110 percent of such carrier's variable cost of transporting the traffic involved to or from the line to which the surcharge applies, plus such carrier's reasonably expected costs of providing service over such line.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Within 5 days after the request of a rail carrier participating in a joint rate subject to a surcharge or cancellation under this section, a shipper moving traffic over a route to which such surcharge or cancellation applies, or an affected port, the Commission shall make available to such carrier, shipper, or port the Commission's determination of the variable costs and revenues, over the route or routes to which the surcharge or cancellation applies, of the carrier applying the surcharge or canceling the application of the joint rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) Whenever a class III rail carrier, in a protest filed with the Commission, makes a prima facie showing that the application of a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or the cancellation of the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section will have an adverse effect on competition, the Commission shall investigate such protest. If, on the basis of such investigation, the Commission finds that the protested surcharge or cancellation is or is intended to be anticompetitive, the Commission shall, within 30 days after the date such protest is filed, enter an order rescinding such surcharge or cancellation, and may, on presentation of an adequate record, prescribe new joint rates or divisions of joint rates.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:233 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) No order prescribed under this subsection shall require a carrier to provide service over any route under a rate which provides revenues less than 110 percent of the variable cost of providing such service unless the Commission determines that the public interest requires a lesser revenue to variable cost ratio to avoid anticompetitive action and to preserve service on the route involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j)(1) Any class III rail carrier which originates or terminates traffic subject to the application of a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or the cancellation of the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section may protest such surcharge or cancellation whenever&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such surcharge or cancellation affects the sole remaining route available to that carrier for that traffic; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) such carrier demonstrates that alternative transportation is available or that a shipper dependent on that carrier will suffer significant market loss because of such surcharge or cancellation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) such surcharge or cancellation, alone or when considered in conjunction with other surcharges or cancellations affecting the carrier, is likely to unduly impair a carrier's ability to earn an adequate rate of return.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Commission may, after an investigation on the basis of a protest under this subsection, prescribe a lesser surcharge or a different division of the joint rate. The Commission shall grant the surcharging or canceling carrier revenues not less than 110 percent of its variable cost of the movement involved, unless it determines that the public interest requires a lesser revenue to variable cost ratio to preserve service on the route involved. Any action by the Commission based on a protest under this subsection shall be taken within 30 days after the date such protest is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission prescribes a different division of a joint rate under this paragraph, the Commission shall, upon petition of the surcharging or canceling carrier or the protesting class III rail carrier, reopen the proceeding in which such division was prescribed to reconsider whether such prescribed division is reasonable. If, on the basis of such reconsideration, the Commission determines that such division is not reasonable, it shall prescribe a new, reasonable division of the joint rate to which the surcharge or cancellation applied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) Upon the complaint of a class III rail carrier which originates or terminates traffic subject to the application of a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or the cancellation of the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section that such surcharge or cancellation will result in differences or greater differences in rates, including any surcharges, for the traffic to which the surcharge or cancellation applies over different routes in which the surcharging or canceling carrier participates&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) from a single origin point to destination points within a 75 mile direct radius from the destination point on such class III rail carrier; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to a single destination point from origin points within a 75 mile direct radius from the origin point on such class III rail carrier,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commission shall investigate such complaint and shall, within 30 days after the date such complaint is filed, take such actions, including rescinding surcharges or cancellations or prescribing new joint rates or surcharges, as it determines are required to eliminate such differences in rates, unless it finds that such actions are not warranted by the public interest in ensuring effective competition among rail carriers or in the preservation of rail service on the route involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No action taken by the Commission under this subsection shall require a carrier to provide service over any route under a rate which provides a revenue to variable cost ratio over such route less than that provided under the joint rate to which the surcharge or cancellation was applied or less than 110 percent, whichever is greater, unless the Commission determines that the public interest in ensuring effective competition among rail carriers or in preserving service over such route warrants requiring the surcharging or canceling carrier to provide service at a lesser revenue to variable cost ratio.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding subsection (m)(1) of this section, if, in a proceeding under this subsection or under subsection (i) or (j) of this section, the Commission considers whether to require the revenues of a carrier applying a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section or canceling the application of a joint rate under subsection (c) of this section to be less than 110 percent of its variable costs (as calculated using the Commission's Rail Form A cost finding methodology), such surcharging or canceling carrier may prove its actual variable costs on the basis of evidence other than unadjusted costs calculated using such Rail Form A cost finding methodology. Such evidence shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) Whenever the application of a joint rate to a through route is canceled under subsection (c) of this section, the Commission shall, upon petition by a class II or III rail carrier participating in such route, prescribe a new compensatory through rate or rates over such route within 30 days after the date such petition is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) variable costs for a class I rail carrier shall be determined only by using such carrier's unadjusted costs, calculated using the Commission's Rail Form A cost finding methodology (or an alternative methodology adopted by the Commission in lieu thereof) and indexed quarterly to account for current wage and price levels in the region in which the carrier operates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) variable costs for a rail carrier other than class I shall be presumed to be the average variable costs of all class I rail carriers in the region in which such carrier operates (as determined under paragraph (1) of this subsection) unless a rail carrier rebuts such presumption with other proof of variable costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) at the option of a carrier applying a surcharge or canceling the application of a joint rate under this section, revenue share may be <!-- PDFPage:234 -->determined by reference to past revenue settlements actually made in the most recent calendar year by connecting lines.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(n) Surcharges applied under subsection (a) or (c) of this section and cancellations under subsection (c) of this section shall not be subject to the provisions of section 10726(a)(1)(B) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>o</em>) The Special Counsel of the Commission may, consistent with the rail transportation policy in section 10101a of this title, provide assistance to class III rail carriers and small businesses in preparing actions under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(p)(1) The authority to apply a surcharge under subsection (a) of this section, and (except as provided in paragraph (2)) the authority to cancel such a surcharge, shall expire 3 years after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 unless extended for one additional year by the Commission upon petition of any rail carrier and for good cause shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any surcharge lawfully applied under subsection (a) of this section shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms following the expiration of the provisions of this section. Any such surcharge applied during the 45-day period immediately preceding the date of the expiration of the provisions of this section shall, notwithstanding such expiration, be subject to cancellation under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section during the 45-day period beginning on the date such surcharge is applied.</p>

The Commission shall approve the agreement only when it finds that the making and carrying out of the agreement will further the transportation policy of section 10101a of this title and may require compliance with conditions necessary to make the agreement further that policy as a condition of its approval. If the Commission approves the agreement, it may be made and carried out under its terms and under the conditions required by the Commission, and the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1, et seq.), the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12, et seq.), the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41, et seq.), sections 73 and 74 of the Wilson Tariff Act (15 U.S.C. 8 and 9), and the Act of June 19, 1936, as amended (15 U.S.C. 13, 13a, 13b, 21a) do not apply to parties and other persons with respect to making or carrying out the agreement. However, the Commission may not approve or continue approval of an agreement when the conditions required by it are not met or if it does not receive a verified statement under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission may approve an agreement under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph only when the carriers applying for approval file a verified statement with the Commission. Each statement must specify for each rail carrier that is a party to the agreement&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:235 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the name of the carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the mailing address and telephone number of its headquarter's office; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the names of each of its affiliates and the names, addresses, and affiliates of each of its officers and directors and of each person, together with an affiliate, owning or controlling any debt, equity, or security interest in it having a value of at least $1,000,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) An organization established or continued under an agreement approved under this subsection shall make a final disposition of a rule or rate docketed with it by the 120th day after the proposal is docketed. Such an organization may not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) permit a rail carrier to discuss, to participate in agreements related to, or to vote on single line rates proposed by another rail carrier, except that for purposes of general rate increases and broad tariff changes only, if the Commission finds at any time that the implementation of this clause is not feasible, it may delay or suspend such implementation in whole or in part;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) permit a rail carrier to discuss, to participate in agreements related to, or to vote on rates related to a particular interline movement unless that rail carrier practicably participates in that movement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) if there are interline movements over two or more routes between the same end points, permit a carrier to discuss, to participate in agreements related to, or to vote on rates except with a carrier which forms part of a particular single route. This clause shall take effect on January 1, 1984, or on such earlier date as the Commission determines. If the Commission finds at any time that the implementation of this clause is not feasible, it may delay or suspend such implementation in whole or in part.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Until January 1, 1984, subparagraph (A)(ii) and (A)(iii) of this paragraph do not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) general rate increases to cover inflationary cost increases, or general rate decreases, for joint rates if the agreement gives shippers, under specified procedures, at least 15 days notice of the proposal and an opportunity to present comments on it before a tariff containing the increases or decreases is filed with the Commission; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) broad tariff changes that are of at least substantially general application throughout the area where the changes will apply, except single line rates where subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph prohibits the participation of carriers with single line rates.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the Commission finds at any time that the implementation of this subparagraph is not feasible, it may delay or suspend such implementation in whole or in part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) In any proceeding in which a party alleges that a rail carrier voted or agreed on a rate or allowance in violation of this subsection, that party has the burden of showing that the vote or agreement occurred. A showing of parallel behavior does not satisfy that burden by itself.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In any proceeding in which it is alleged that a carrier was a party to an agreement, conspiracy, or combination in violation of a Federal law cited in subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section or of any similar State law, proof of an agreement, conspiracy, or combination may not be inferred from evidence that two or more carriers acted together with respect to an interline rate or related matter and that a party to such action took similar action with respect to a rate or related matter on another route or traffic. In any proceeding in which such a violation is alleged, evidence of a discussion or agreement between or among such carrier and one or more other carriers, or of any rate or other action resulting from such discussion or agreement, shall not be admissible if the discussion or agreement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) was in accordance with an agreement approved under paragraph (2) of this subsection; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) concerned an interline movement of the carrier, and the discussion or agreement would not, considered by itself, violate the laws referred to in the first sentence of this clause.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In any proceeding before a jury, the court shall determine whether the requirements of clause (I) or (II) are satisfied before allowing the introduction of any such evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) An organization described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall provide that transcripts or sound recordings be made of all meetings, that records of votes be made, and that such transcripts or recordings and voting records be submitted to the Commission and made available to other Federal agencies in connection with their statutory responsibilities over rate bureaus, except that such material shall be kept confidential and shall not be subject to disclosure under section 552 of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, one or more rail carriers may enter into an agreement, without obtaining prior Commission approval, that provides solely for compilation, publication, and other distribution of rates in effect or to become effective. The Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.), the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.), sections 73 and 74 of the Wilson Tariff Act (15 U.S.C. 8 and 9), and the Act of June 19, 1936, as amended (15 U.S.C. 13, 13a, 13b, 21a) shall not apply to parties and other persons with respect to making or carrying out such agreement. However, the Commission may, upon application or on its own initiative, investigate whether the parties to such an agreement have exceeded its scope, and upon a finding that they have, the Commission may issue such orders as are necessary, including an order dissolving the agreement, to ensure that actions taken pursuant to the agreement are limited as provided in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Whenever two or more shippers enter into an agreement to discuss among themselves that relates to the amount of compensation such shippers propose to be paid by rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, for use by such rail carriers of rolling stock owned or leased by such shippers, the shippers shall apply to the Commission for approval of that agreement under this para<!-- PDFPage:236 -->graph. The Commission shall approve the agreement only when it finds that the making and carrying out of the agreement will further the transportation policy set forth in section 10101a of this title and may require compliance with conditions necessary to make the agreement further that policy as a condition of approval. If the Commission approves the agreement, it may be made and carried out under its terms and under the terms required by the Commission, and the antitrust laws set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection do not apply to parties and other persons with respect to making or carrying out the agreement. The Commission shall approve or disapprove an agreement under this paragraph within one year after the date application for approval of such agreement is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission approves an agreement described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and the shippers entering into such agreement and the rail carriers proposing to use rolling stock owned or leased by such shippers, under payment by such carriers or under a published allowance, are unable to agree upon the amount of compensation to be paid for the use of such rolling stock, any party directly involved in the negotiations may require that the matter be settled by submitting the issues in dispute to the Commission. The Commission shall render a binding decision, based upon a standard of reasonableness and after taking into consideration any past precedents on the subject matter of the negotiations, no later than 90 days after the date of the submission of the dispute to the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to change the law in effect prior to the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 with respect to the obligation of rail carriers to utilize rolling stock owned or leased by shippers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;single-line rate&rdquo; refers to a rate, charge, or allowance proposed by a single motor common carrier that is applicable only over its line and for which the transportation can be provided by that carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As provided by this subsection, a motor common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title may enter into an agreement with one or more such carriers concerning rates (including charges between carriers and compensation paid or received for the use of facilities and equipment), allowances, classifications, divisions, or rules related to them, or procedures for joint consideration, initiation, or establishment of them. Such agreement may be submitted to the Commission for approval by any carrier or carriers which are parties to such agreement and shall be approved by the Commission upon a finding that the agreement fulfills each requirement of this subsection, unless the Commission finds that such agreement is inconsistent with the transportation policy set forth in section 10101(a) of this title. The Commission may require compliance with reasonable conditions consistent with this subtitle to assure that the agreement furthers such transportation policy. If the Commission approves the agreement, it may be made and carried out under its terms and under the conditions required by the Commission, and the antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12), do not apply to parties and other persons with respect to making or carrying out the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Agreements submitted to the Commission under this subsection may be approved by the Commission only if each of the following conditions are met:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Each carrier which is a party to an agreement must file with the Commission a verified statement that specifies its name, mailing address, and telephone number of its main office; the names of each of its affiliates; the names, addresses, and affiliates of each of its officers and directors; the names, addresses, and affiliates of each person, together with an affiliate, owning or controlling any debt, equity, or security interest in it having a value of at least $1,000,000. In this subparagraph, &ldquo;affiliate&rdquo; means a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control or ownership with another person and &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; means equity holdings in a business entity of at least 5 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Any organization established or continued under an agreement approved under this subsection must comply with the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) subject to the provisions of subparagraphs (C), (D), (E), and (F) of this paragraph, (I) the organization may allow any member carrier to discuss any rate proposal docketed, but (II) after January 1, 1981, only those carriers with authority to participate in the transportation to which the rate proposal applies may vote upon such rate proposal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the organization may not interfere with each carrier's right of independent action and may not change or cancel any rate established by independent action after the date of enactment of this subsection, other than a general increase or broad rate restructuring, except that changes in such rates may be effected, with the consent of the carrier or carriers that initiated the independent action, for the purpose of tariff simplification, removal of discrimination, or elimination of obsolete items;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the organization may not file a protest or complaint with the Commission against any tariff item published by or for the account of any motor carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the organization may not permit one of its employees or any employee committee to docket or act upon any proposal effecting a change in any tariff item published by or for the account of any of its member carriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) upon request, the organization must divulge to any person the name of the proponent of a rule or rate docketed with it, must admit any person to any meeting at which rates or rules will be discussed or voted upon, and must divulge to any person the vote cast by any member carrier on any proposal before the organization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) the organization may not allow a carrier to vote for one or more other carriers without specific written authority from the carrier being represented; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:237 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(vii) the organization shall make a final disposition of a rule or rate docketed with it by the 120th day after the proposal is docketed, except that if unusual circumstances require, the organization may extend such period, subject to review by the Commission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) No agreement approved under this subsection may provide for discussion of or voting on rates to which the provisions of section 10708(d) or 10730(b) of this title apply, except that rates established or filed under section 10730 of this title before the date of enactment of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 or changes with respect to such rates may be discussed or voted on under agreements approved under this subsection until January 1, 1984.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) No agreement approved under this subsection may provide for discussion of or voting upon single-line rates on or after January 1, 1984, except that such date shall be July 1, 1984, if the Motor Carrier Ratemaking Study Commission does not submit its final report under section 14(b)(4) of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 on or before January 1, 1983. This subparagraph shall not apply to any single-line rate proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers. This subparagraph and subparagraph (B)(i)(II) of this paragraph shall not apply to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) general rate increases or decreases if the agreement gives shippers, under specified procedures, at least 15 days&rsquo; notice of the proposal and an opportunity to present comments on it before a tariff containing the increases or decreases is filed with the Commission and if discussion of such increases or decreases is limited to industry average carrier costs and, after the date of elimination of the antitrust immunity by this subparagraph, does not include discussion of individual markets or particular single-line rates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) changes in commodity classifications;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) changes in tariff structures if discussion of such changes is limited to industry average carrier costs and, after the date of elimination of antitrust immunity by this subparagraph, does not include discussion of individual markets or particular single-line rates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) publishing of tariffs, filing of independent actions for individual members carriers, providing of support services for members, and changes in rules or regulations which are of at least substantially general application throughout the area in which such changes will apply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) On and after January 1, 1983, no agreement approved under this subsection may provide for discussion of or voting upon any single-line rate proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers. On and after January 1, 1984, no agreement approved under this subsection may provide for discussion of or voting upon any joint rate proposed by one or more motor common carriers of passengers. This subparagraph shall not apply to any rate applicable to special or charter transportation. This subparagraph and subparagraph (B)(i)(II) of this paragraph shall not apply to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) any general rate increase or decrease, broad change in tariff structure, or promotional or innovative fare change, as defined by the Commission and subject to such notice requirements as the Commission may specify by regulation, if discussion of such general increase or decrease is limited to industry average carrier costs and intermodal competitive factors and does not include discussion of individual markets or particular single-line rates or joint rates; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) publishing of tariffs, filing of independent actions for individual member carriers, providing of support services for members, and changes in rules or regulations which are of at least substantially general application throughout the area in which such changes will apply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) After the effective date of this subparagraph, no agreement approved under this subsection may provide for discussion of or voting upon any rate applicable to special or charter transportation proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers. This subparagraph shall not apply to publication of any such rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) In any proceeding in which a party to such proceeding alleges that a carrier voted, discussed, or agreed on a rate or allowance in violation of this subsection, that party has the burden of showing that the vote, discussion, or agreement occurred. A showing of parallel behavior does not satisfy that burden by itself.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) The Commission shall, by regulation, determine reasonable quorum standards to be applied for meetings of organizations established or continued under an agreement approved under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, before the date on which the antitrust immunity is eliminated for discussion of or voting on single-line rates by paragraph (3)(D) of this subsection, the Commission may not take any action which would, on the basis of the type of carrier service involved (including service by carriers singly or in combination with other carriers), result in the exclusion of one or more motor common carriers of property from discussion or voting under agreements authorized by this subsection on matters concerning rates, allowances, classifications, or divisions, except that before such date, the Commission may issue regulations which take effect on or after such date to carry out the provisions of such paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle (other than paragraph (3)(F) of this subsection, relating to special and charter transportation of passengers), before January 1, 1983, the Commission may not take any action which would, on the basis of the type of carrier service involved (including service by carriers singly or in combination with other carriers), result in the exclusion of one or more motor common carriers of passengers from discussion or voting under agreements authorized by this subsection on matters concerning rates, allowances, or divisions, except that before January 1, 1983, the Commission may issue regulations which take effect on or after January 1, 1983, to carry out the provisions of paragraph (3)(E) of this subsection.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:238 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under chapter 105 of this title (except a rail carrier or a motor common carrier) that is a party to an agreement of at least 2 carriers related to rates (including charges between carriers and compensation paid or received for the use of facilities and equipment), allowances, classifications, divisions, or rules related to them, or procedures for joint consideration, initiation, or establishment of them, may apply to the Commission for approval of that agreement under this subsection. The Commission shall approve the agreement only when it finds that the making and carrying out of the agreement will further the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title and may require compliance with conditions necessary to make the agreement further that policy as a condition of approval. If the Commission approves the agreement, it may be made and carried out under its terms and under the conditions required by the Commission, and the antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12), do not apply to parties and other persons with respect to making or carrying out the agreement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may not approve an agreement under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) between or among carriers of different classes unless, in addition to the finding required under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section, the Commission finds that the agreement is limited to matters related to transportation under joint rates or over through routes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) related to a pooling, division, or other matter to which subchapter III of chapter 113 of this title applies; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) establishing a procedure for determination of a matter through joint consideration unless the Commission finds that each party to the agreement has the absolute right under it to take independent action before or after a determination is made under that procedure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Commission may require an organization established or continued under an agreement approved under this section to maintain records and submit reports. The Commission, or its delegate, may inspect a record maintained under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Commission may review an agreement approved under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section and shall change the conditions of approval or terminate it when necessary to comply with (1) the public interest and subsection (a), or (2) subsection (b) or (c).

If the Commission finds that an agreement or organization does not conform to the requirements of that subsection, it shall end or suspend its approval. The Commission shall report to the President and Congress the results of the review as a part of its annual report under section 10311 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) The Federal Trade Commission, in consultation with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, shall prepare periodically an assessment of, and shall report to the Commission on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) possible anticompetitive features of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) an organization operating under those agreements; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) possible ways to alleviate or end an anticompetitive feature, effect, or aspect in a manner that will further the goals of this subtitle and of the transportation policy of section 10101a of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1), the words &ldquo;directly or indirectly&rdquo; from 49:5c(1)(a) are omitted as surplus, and 49:5c(1)(C) is omitted as unnecessary. The definition of &ldquo;single-line rate&rdquo; contained in the text of 49:5c(5)(a) (last sentence) is included for consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2), the words &ldquo;or an agreement with a class of carriers referred to in subsection (c)(1)(B)&ndash;(E) of this section&rdquo; are inserted for clarity in view of the amendment made by section 208(a) of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 that removed rail carriers from 49:5b but did not specifically resolve the question of which section governs intermodal agreements by rail carriers. The words inserted in the revised section require rail carriers that make intermodal agreements to comply with 49:5c to reflect the ambiguity. The words &ldquo;under such rules and regulations as the Commission shall prescribe&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary in view of the general power to prescribe regulations under section 10321 of the revised title.

The 3d sentence restates 49:5c(8) for clarity. The word &ldquo;written&rdquo; in 49:5c(2) is omitted as unnecessary in the 4th sentence. 49:5c(2)(v) is omitted as unnecessary because of section 10321 of the revised title giving the Commission the authority to carry out the subtitle and to prescribe regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(3)(A), the word &ldquo;organization&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;conference, bureau, committee, or other organization&rdquo; as being more inclusive. In subsection (a)(3)(A)(i), 49:5c(5)(a)(i) and (ii) are consolidated to eliminate redundancy. The words &ldquo;of the same mode&rdquo; are omitted as surplus since this subsection applies only to rail carriers.

The words &ldquo;by order&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;if approval thereof is not prohibited by paragraph (4), (5), or (6) of this section&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary in view of the restatement. The words &ldquo;will further&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;by reason of furtherance&rdquo; for clarity. The word &ldquo;only&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;otherwise the application shall be denied&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;may require compliance with conditions necessary to make the agreement further that policy as a condition of approval&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;upon such terms and conditions as the Commission may prescribe as necessary to enable it to grant its approval in accordance with the standard above set forth in this paragraph&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1), the reference to rail carriers in a class is retained to reflect the ambiguity resulting from the amendment made by section 208(a) of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(2), the words &ldquo;which it finds&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The word &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;free and unrestrained&rdquo; as being more appropriate. The words &ldquo;without fear of any sanction or retaliatory action&rdquo; are omitted as included in the words &ldquo;absolute right&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the word &ldquo;records&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;accounts, records, files, and memoranda&rdquo; to eliminate redundancy and for consistency with other sections of the revised title and with subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5. The words &ldquo;or its delegate&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;its duly authorized representatives&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words &ldquo;upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint&rdquo; are omitted in view of subsection (f). The word &ldquo;review&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;investigate and determine&rdquo; in view of the general authority to carry out the subtitle in section 10321 of the revised subtitle. The words &ldquo;or terms and conditions upon which such approval was granted&rdquo; are omitted as surplus in view of the restatement. The word &ldquo;change&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;modify&rdquo; for consistency. The words &ldquo;when necessary to comply with (1) the public interest and subsection (a), or (2) subsection (b)&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;if it finds such action necessary to insure conformity with such standard .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to the extent it finds necessary to insure conformity with such standard or to the extent to which it finds such terms and conditions not necessary to insure such conformity&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f), the text of 49:5b(8) is omitted as surplus in view of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5 and subchapter II of chapter 103 of the revised title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) When a new individual or joint rate or individual or joint classification, rule, or practice related to a rate is filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission by a rail carrier providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, the Commission may begin a proceeding, on its own initiative or on complaint of an interested <!-- PDFPage:242 -->party, to determine whether the proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice violates this subtitle. The Commission must give reasonable notice to interested parties before beginning a proceeding under this subsection but may act without allowing an interested party to file an answer or other formal pleading in response to its decision to begin the proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Commission must complete a proceeding under this section and make its final decision by the end of the 5th month after the rate, classification, rule, or practice was to become effective, except that if the Commission reports to the Congress by the end of such 5th month that it cannot make a final decision by that time and explains the reason for the delay, it may take an additional 3 months to complete the proceeding and make its final decision. If the Commission does not reach a final decision within the applicable time period, the rate, classification, rule, or practice&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is effective at the end of that time period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if already in effect at the end of that time period, remains in effect.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an interested party has filed a complaint under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission may set aside a rate, classification, rule, or practice, that has become effective under this section if the Commission finds it to be in violation of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Commission may not suspend a proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice during the course of a Commission proceeding under this section unless it appears from the specific facts shown by the verified statement of a person that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) it is substantially likely that the protestant will prevail on the merits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) without suspension, the proposed rate change will cause substantial injury to the protestant or the party represented by the protestant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) because of the peculiar economic circumstances of the protestant, the provisions of subsection (d) of this section do not protect the protestant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The burden shall be on the protestant to prove the matters described in paragraph (1)(A), (B), and (C) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) If the Commission does not suspend a proposed rate increase under subsection (c) of this section, the Commission shall require the rail carrier to account for all amounts received under the increase until the Commission completes its proceedings under subsection (b) of this section. The accounting shall specify by whom and for whom the amounts are paid. When the Commission takes final action, it shall require the carrier to refund to the person for whom the amounts were paid that part of the increased rate found to be unreasonable, plus interest at a rate equal to the average yield (on the date the statement is filed) of marketable securities of the United States Government having a duration of 90 days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a rate is suspended under subsection (c) of this section and any portion of such rate is later found to be reasonable under this subtitle, the carrier shall collect from each person using the transportation to which the rate applies the difference between the original rate and the portion of the suspended rate found to be reasonable for any services performed during the period of suspension, plus interest at a rate equal to the average yield (on the date the statement is filed) of marketable securities of the United States Government having a duration of 90 days, except that this paragraph shall not apply to general rate increases under section 10706 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If any portion of a proposed rate decrease is suspended under subsection (c) of this section and later found to be reasonable under this subtitle, the rail carrier may refund any part of the portion of the decrease found to comply with this subtitle if the carrier makes the refund available to each shipper who participated in the rate, in accordance with the relative amount of such shipper's traffic transported at such rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 10741 or section 10761 of this title, the Commission shall, by rule, establish standards and procedures permitting a rail carrier to waive the collection of amounts due under this subsection if such amounts are not significant.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10707a. Zone of rail carrier rate flexibility</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) &ldquo;base rate&rdquo; means, with respect to the transportation of a particular commodity (i) for the 24-month period beginning on October 1, 1980, the rate in effect on October 1, 1980, (ii) for the 24-month period beginning on October 1, 1982, the rate in effect on October 1, 1982, and (iii) for the 5-year period beginning on October 1, 1984, and for each subsequent 5-year period, the rate in effect on the first day of the applicable 5-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If no rate exists for the transportation of a particular commodity on October 1, 1980, the base rate for the transportation of such commodity shall be the rate established by the rail carrier (divided by the latest rail cost adjustment factor published by the Commission), unless such rate is found to be unreasonable by the Commission, in which case the base rate shall be the rate authorized by the Commission (divided by the latest rail cost adjustment factor published by the Commission).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) &ldquo;adjusted base rate&rdquo; means the base rate for the transportation of a particular commodity multiplied by the latest rail cost adjustment factor published by the Commission pursuant to this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Commencing with the fourth quarter of 1980, the Commission shall, as often as practicable but in no event less often than quarterly, publish a rail cost adjustment factor which shall be a fraction, the numerator of which is the latest published Index of Railroad Costs (which index shall be compiled or verified by the Commission, with appropriate adjustments to reflect the changing composition of railroad costs, including the quality and mix of material and labor), and the denominator of which is the same index for the fourth quarter of 1980, or for the fourth quarter of 1982 or for the fourth quarter of every fifth year thereafter, as appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may increase any rate over which the Commission has jurisdiction under section 10709 of this title so long as the increased rate is not greater than the adjusted base rate for the transportation involved, plus any rate increases implemented under subsection (c) or (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A rate increase authorized under this subsection may not be found to exceed a reasonable maximum for the transportation involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A rail carrier may not increase a rate under this subsection to the extent that the cost increases to such carrier due to inflation are recovered through (A) general rate increases pursuant to section 10706 of this title, or (B) inflation-based rate increases under section 10712 of this title applicable to that rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) During the 12-month period beginning on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and during each of the 3 succeeding 12-month periods, a rail carrier may, in addition to rate increases authorized under subsection (b) of this section, increase any rate over which the Commission has jurisdiction under section 10709 of this title by an annual amount of not more than 6 percent of the adjusted base rate, except that in no event shall the total increase under this subsection result in a rate which is more than 118 percent of the adjusted base rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If any portion of a rate increase under this subsection is not implemented in the year in which it is authorized, such portion may, except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, be implemented only in the next succeeding year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If any portion of the total rate increase authorized under this subsection is not implemented by the end of the 4-year period beginning on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, such portion may be implemented in the next 2 succeeding years, except that in no event may a rail carrier increase a rate under this subsection or under subsection (d) of this section in either of such 2 succeeding years by an annual amount of more than 10 percent of the adjusted base rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, during the 12-month period beginning on October 1, 1984, and during each succeeding 12-month period, a rail carrier may, in <!-- PDFPage:244 -->addition to rate increases under subsection (b) of this section, increase any rate over which the Commission has jurisdiction under section 10709 of this title by an annual amount of not more than 4 percent of the adjusted base rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No portion of any rate increase under this subsection which is not implemented in the year in which it is authorized may be implemented in any other year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to a rail carrier proposing to increase a single line rate if such carrier earns adequate revenues, as determined by the Commission under section 10704(a)(2) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission shall, after a hearing on the record, prescribe such rules with respect to joint rates as necessary to ensure that rail carriers which earn adequate revenues, as determined under section 10704(a)(2) of this title, do not receive the rate increases authorized by this subsection unless the Commission determines that it is unable to prescribe such rules without precluding rail carriers not earning adequate revenues from receiving the rate increases authorized under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 10707 of this title, in the case of any rate increase by a rail carrier that is authorized under subsection (c) or (d) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) the Commission may not suspend such rate increase pending final Commission action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Commission may not begin an investigation proceeding under section 10707 of this title with respect to the reasonableness of such rate increase; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an interested party may file a complaint under section 11701(b) of this title alleging that such rate increase violates the provisions of this subtitle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In considering any complaint challenging a rate increase that is authorized under subsection (c) of this section and that results in a revenue-variable cost percentage that is less than the lesser of the percentages described in clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (2)(A), the Commission shall, in determining the reasonableness of such rate increase, give due consideration to whether the carrier proposing the rate increase has attained adequate revenues, as determined by the Commission under section 10704(a)(2) of this title, giving regard to preventing a carrier with adequate revenues from realizing excessive profits on the traffic involved and also the policy of bringing to an adequate level the revenues of carriers not having an adequate revenue level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If a rate increase authorized under this section in any year results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for the transportation to which the rate applies that is equal to or greater than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) 20 percentage points above the revenue-variable cost percentage applicable in that year under section 10709(d) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a revenue-variable cost percentage of 190 percent,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">whichever is less, the Commission may, on its own initiative, or on complaint of an interested party, begin an investigation proceeding to determine whether the proposed rate increase violates this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In determining whether to investigate or not to investigate any proposed rate increase that results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for the transportation to which the rate applies that is equal to or greater than the lesser of the percentages described in clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (without regard to whether such rate increase is authorized under this section), the Commission shall set forth its reasons therefor, giving due consideration to the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the amount of traffic which is transported at revenues which do not contribute to going concern value and efforts made to minimize such traffic;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount of traffic which contributes only marginally to fixed costs and the extent to which, if any, rates on such traffic can be changed to maximize the revenues from such traffic; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the impact of the proposed rate or rate increase on the attainment of the national energy goals and the rail transportation policy under section 10101a of this title, taking into account the railroads&rsquo; role as a primary source of energy transportation and the need for a sound rail transportation system in accordance with the revenue adequacy goals of section 10704 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">This subparagraph shall not be construed to change existing law with regard to the nonreviewability of such determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In determining whether a rate is reasonable, the Commission shall consider, among other factors, evidence of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the amount of traffic which is transported at revenues which do not contribute to going concern value and efforts made to minimize such traffic;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount of traffic which contributes only marginally to fixed costs and the extent to which, if any, rates on such traffic can be changed to maximize the revenues from such traffic; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the carrier's mix of rail traffic to determine whether one commodity is paying an unreasonable share of the carrier's overall revenues.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) In any proceeding under this section, evidence of the underlying rail carrier rate is admissible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) A finding by the Commission that a rate increase exceeds the increase authorized under this section does not establish a presumption that (1) the rail carrier proposing such rate increase has or does not have market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies, or (2) the proposed rate exceeds or does not exceed a reasonable maximum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The authority of the Commission to determine and prescribe reasonable rules, classifications, and practices may not be used, directly or indirectly, to limit the rates which rail carriers are otherwise authorized to establish under this subtitle.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The Interstate Commerce Commission may begin a proceeding to determine the lawfulness of a proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice immediately, on its own initiative or on application of an interested party when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a new individual or joint rate or individual or joint classification, rule, or practice affecting a rate is filed with the Commission by a common carrier, other than a rail carrier, under this subtitle; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a new or reduced rate or rule or practice that causes a reduction of a rate is filed with the Commission by a contract carrier under this subtitle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission must give reasonable notice before beginning a proceeding under this section but may act without allowing an interested carrier to file an answer or other formal pleading in response to its decision to begin the proceeding. The Commission may take whatever final action on a rate, classification, rule, or practice under this section, after a full hearing (whether completed before or after the rate, classification, rule, or practices goes into effect), as it could in a proceeding begun after a rate, �7E�7Eclassification, �7E�7Erule, �7E�7Eor �7E�7Epractice �7E�7Ebecame effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Pending final Commission action in a proceeding under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission may suspend the proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice at any time for not more than 7 months beyond the time it would otherwise go into effect by (1) delivering to each affected carrier, and (2) filing with the proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice, a statement of reasons for the suspension. If the Commission does not take final action during the suspension period, the proposed rate, classification, rule, or practice is effective at the end of that period. However, if an increase in a rate for, or related to, transportation of property by an express, sleeping car, or pipeline carrier becomes effective under this subsection, the Commission may require the interested carrier to account for all amounts received under it and specify by whom and on whose behalf those amounts were paid. When the Commission takes final action, it may require the carrier to refund, with interest, to the persons on whose behalf those amounts were paid, the part of the increased rate found to be in violation of this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In a proceeding under this section, the burden is on the carrier proposing the changed rate, classification, rule, or practice to prove that the change is reasonable. The Commission shall give proceedings under this section preference over all other proceedings related to that type of carrier pending before it and make its decision at the earliest practical time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the Commission may not investigate, suspend, revise, or revoke any rate proposed by a motor common carrier of property or household goods freight forwarder on the grounds that such rate is unreasonable on the basis that it is too high or too low if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the carrier notifies the Commission that it wishes to have the rate considered pursuant to this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the aggregate of increases and decreases in any such rate is not more than 10 percent above the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate, nor more than 10 percent below the lesser of the rate in effect on July 1, 1980 (or, in the case of any rate which a carrier first establishes after July 1, 1980, for a service not provided by such carrier on such date, such rate on the date such rate first becomes effective), or the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission, by rule, may increase the percentages specified in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection for any group of motor common car<!-- PDFPage:246 -->riers of property or household goods freight forwarders if it finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there is sufficient actual and potential competition to regulate rates; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) there are benefits to (i) carriers or household goods freight forwarders, (ii) shippers, and (iii) the public from further rate flexibility;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that the Commission may not increase such percentages by more than 5 percentage points during any one-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In determining, pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, whether the aggregate of increases and decreases in a proposed rate that is to take effect on or before the 730th day following the date of enactment of this paragraph is more than 10 percent (or such other percentage as the Commission may establish under paragraph (2) of this subsection) above the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate, general rate increases obtained in the one-year period prior to the effective date of the proposed rate shall not be included in such aggregate, except to the extent that such general rate increases exceed 5 percent of the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a proposed rate that is to take effect after the 730th day following the date of enactment of this paragraph, the percentage which first appears in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection (relating to the upper limit of the zone of ratemaking freedom), or such other percentage as the Commission may establish under paragraph (2) of this subsection in lieu of such percentage, shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the percentage change in the Producers Price Index, as published by the Department of Labor, that has occurred during the one-year period prior to the effective date of the proposed rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the Commission may not investigate, suspend, revise, or revoke any single-line rate proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers, or joint rate proposed by one or more such carriers, applicable to any transportation (other than special or charter transportation) on the grounds that such rate is unreasonable on the basis that it is too high or too low if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the carrier or carriers notify the Commission that they wish to have the rate considered pursuant to this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the aggregate of increases and decreases in any such rate is not more than 10 percent above the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate, nor more than 20 percent below the lesser of the rate in effect on the effective date of this paragraph (or, in case of any rate which the carrier or carriers first establish after such date for a service not provided by the carrier or carriers on such date, such rate on the date such rate first becomes effective), or the rate in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed rate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) One year after the effective date of this paragraph, the first and second percentages specified in paragraph (4)(B) of this subsection shall change to 15 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Two years after the effective date, the first and second percentages specified in paragraph (4)(B) of this subsection shall change to 20 percent and 30 percent, respectively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any rate implemented by a carrier pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to the antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12), except that the docketing and publication of such rate by the carrier under section 10706(b) of this title shall not be construed as a violation of the antitrust laws. Evidence that any motor common carrier of passengers established pursuant to this subsection a joint or single-line rate applicable to transportation over any route which is the same as or similar to a joint rate applicable to transportation over such route which such carrier together with one or more other motor common carriers of passengers established pursuant to this subsection shall not be in and of itself sufficient to establish a violation of any such antitrust law. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the Commission's authority to suspend and investigate proposed rates on the basis that such rates may violate the provisions of section 10741 of this title or constitute predatory practices in contravention of the transportation policy set forth in section 10101(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, 3 years after the effective date of this subsection, the Commission may not investigate, suspend, revise, or revoke any rate proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers on the grounds that such rate is unreasonable on the basis that it is too high or too low, unless the proposed rate is established collectively in accordance with the procedures of an agreement approved by the Commission under section 10706(b) of this title. In publishing and filing a tariff under section 10762 of this title, the carrier shall disclose whether such rate is the result of collective ratemaking procedures pursuant to an agreement approved by the Commission under section 10706(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, an interested party may file a complaint under section 11701 of this title challenging the reasonableness of a rate filed under this section by a motor carrier of passengers. Any such complaint proceeding shall be finally determined by the Commission no later than 90 days after the filing of the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the Commission may not investigate, suspend, revise, or revoke any rate proposed by a motor common carrier of passengers applicable to special or charter transportation. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the Commission's authority to suspend and investigate proposed rates on the basis that such rates constitute predatory practices in contravention of the transportation policy set forth in section 10101(a) of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10709. Determination of market dominance in rail carrier rate proceedings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section, &ldquo;market dominance&rdquo; means an absence of effective competition from other carriers or modes of transportation for the transportation to which a rate applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When a rate for transportation by a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title is challenged as being unreasonably high, the Commission shall determine, within 90 days after the start of a proceeding under section 10707 of this title to investigate the lawfulness of that rate, whether the carrier proposing the rate has market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies. The Commission may make that determination on its own initiative or on complaint. A finding by the Commission that the carrier does not have market dominance is determinative in a proceeding under this subtitle related to that rate or transportation unless changed or set aside by the Commission or set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When the Commission finds in any proceeding that a rail carrier proposing or defending a rate for transportation has market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies, it may then determine that rate to be unreasonable if it exceeds a reasonable maximum for that transportation. However, a finding of market dominance does not establish a presumption that the proposed rate exceeds a reasonable maximum. This subsection does not limit the power of the Commission to suspend a rate under section 10707(c) of this title. However, if the Commission has found that a carrier does not have market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies, the Commission may suspend an increase in that rate as being in excess of a reasonable maximum for that transportation only if it specifically changes or sets aside its prior determination of market dominance.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:248 --><p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) In this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) &ldquo;fixed and variable cost&rdquo; means all cost incurred by rail carriers in the transportation of freight, but limiting the return on equity capital to a rate equal to the embedded cost of debt.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) &ldquo;cost recovery percentage&rdquo; means the lowest revenue-variable cost percentage which, if all movements that produced revenues resulting in revenue-variable cost percentages in excess of the cost recovery percentage are deemed to have produced only revenues resulting in the cost recovery percentage, would produce revenues which would be equal, when combined with total revenues produced by all other traffic transported by rail carrier, to the total fixed and variable cost of the transportation of all traffic by rail carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for purposes of determining the cost recovery percentage only, &ldquo;revenue-variable cost percentage&rdquo; means the quotient, expressed as a percentage figure, obtained by dividing the total revenues produced by the transportation of all traffic received by rail carriers for rail transportation by the total variable cost of such transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In making a determination under this section, the Commission shall find that the rail carrier establishing the challenged rate does not have market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies if such rail carrier proves that the rate charged results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for such transportation that is less than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 160 percent during the period beginning on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and ending September 30, 1981;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 165 percent during the period beginning October 1, 1981, and ending September 30, 1982;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) 170 percent during the period beginning October 1, 1982, and ending September 30, 1983;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) 175 percent or the cost recovery percentage, whichever is less, during the period beginning October 1, 1983, and ending September 30, 1984; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the cost recovery percentage, during each 12-month period beginning on or after October 1, 1984.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of subparagraphs (D) and (E) of this paragraph, the cost recovery percentage shall in no event be less than a revenue-variable cost percentage of 170 percent or more than a revenue-variable cost percentage of 180 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of determining the revenue-variable cost percentage for a particular transportation, variable costs shall be determined pursuant to section 10705a(m)(1) of this title, with adjustments specified by the Commission. A rail carrier may meet its burden of proof under this subsection by establishing its variable costs in accordance with such section 10705a(m)(1), but a shipper may rebut that showing by evidence of such type, and in accordance with such burden of proof, as the Commission shall prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A finding by the Commission that a rate charged by a rail carrier results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for the transportation to which the rate applies that is equal to or greater than the applicable percentage under paragraph (2) of this subsection does not establish a presumption that (A) such rail carrier has or does not have market dominance over such transportation, or (B) the proposed rate exceeds or does not exceed a reasonable maximum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Within 180 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and on an annual basis thereafter, the Commission shall determine the cost recovery percentage for the transportation of all traffic received by rail carriers. The Commission shall make such determination after considering each individual revenue-variable cost percentage resulting from the revenues and costs of a valid and reliable statistical sample of all movements of commodities transported by class I rail carriers during the most recent calendar year for which such information is available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If, on the basis of calculations under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Commission determines that revenues earned by all class I rail carriers during the previous calendar year do not exceed the fixed and variable costs of such carriers, then the cost recovery percentage for purposes of this section shall be deemed to be equal to the cost recovery percentage last determined by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Commission shall, in its annual report submitted to the Congress under section 10311 of this title, set forth the cost recovery percentage determined for that year under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10713. Contracts</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) One or more rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may enter into a contract with one or more purchasers of rail services to provide specified services under specified rates and conditions. Such a rail carrier may not enter into a contract with purchasers of rail service except as provided in this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:250 --><p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Each contract entered into under this section shall be filed with the Commission, together with a summary of the contract containing such nonconfidential information as the Commission prescribes. The Commission shall publish special tariff rules for such contracts in order to assure that the essential terms of the contract are available to the general public in tariff format.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The essential terms of any contract for the transportation of agricultural commodities to be made available to the general public in tariff format under this subsection shall include, but shall not be limited to (i) the identity of the shipper party to the contract; (ii) the specific origins, transit points and other shipper facilities subject to the contract, and destinations served under such contract; (iii) the duration of the contract, including provisions for optional extension; (iv) the actual volume requirements, if any; (v) whether any transportation service has begun under a contract before the date such contract is filed with or approved by the Commission, and (vi) the date on which the contract became applicable to the transportation services provided under the contract. The Commission shall interpret this subsection to provide for liberal discovery to shippers seeking remedies under subsection (d)(2)(B) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any amendment, supplement, or change to any term or provision of any contract described in subparagraph (A), including extensions of such contract, changes of origin, transit points, affected shipper facilities, destination points, or negotiated economic terms, shall be deemed to be a separate and new contract for the purposes of this subsection. Such amendments, supplements, or changes shall be filed separately with the Commission as provided in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Within 60 days after the date of the enactment of the Conrail Privatization Act, the Commission shall issue regulations which require that essential terms of contracts described in subparagraph (A) shall be made available to the general public in tariff format as provided in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The railroad contract rate advisory service established pursuant to subsection (m) of this section shall assess the impact on competition among agricultural shippers of variations between contract rates for various shipments and the published single car rates, and shall submit a report to the Congress not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of the Conrail Privatization Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A contract filed under this section shall be approved by the Commission, as provided in subsection (e) of this section, unless the Commission determines in a proceeding under subsection (d) of this section that such contract is in violation of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) No later than 30 days after the date of filing of a contract under this section, the Commission may, on its own initiative or on complaint, begin a proceeding to review such contract on the grounds described in this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the case of a contract other than a contract for the transportation of agricultural commodities (including forest products and paper), a complaint may be filed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) by a shipper only on the grounds that such shipper individually will be harmed because the proposed contract unduly impairs the ability of the contracting carrier or carriers to meet their common carrier obligations to the complainant under section 11101 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) by a port only on the grounds that such port individually will be harmed because the proposed contract will result in unreasonable discrimination against such port.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a contract for the transportation of agricultural commodities (including forest products and paper), in addition to the grounds for a complaint described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, a complaint may be filed by a shipper on the grounds that such shipper individually will be harmed because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the rail carrier has unreasonably discriminated by refusing to enter into a contract with such shipper for rates and services for the transportation of the same type of commodity under similar conditions to the contract at issue, and that shipper was ready, willing, and able to enter into such a contract at a time essentially contemporaneous with the period during which the contract at issue was offered; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the proposed contract constitutes a destructive competitive practice under this subtitle.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In making a determination under clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the Commission shall consider the difference between contract rates and published single car rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;unreasonable discrimination&rdquo; has the same meaning as such term has under section 10741 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Within 30 days after the date a proceeding is commenced under paragraph (1) of this subsection, or within such shorter time period after such date as the Commission may establish, the Commission shall determine whether the contract that is the subject of such proceeding is in violation of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission determines, on the basis of a complaint filed under paragraph (2)(B)(i) of this subsection, that the grounds for a complaint described in such paragraph have been established with respect to a carrier, the Commission shall, subject to the provisions of this section, order such carrier to provide rates and service substantially similar to the contract at issue with such differentials in terms and conditions as are justified by the evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Approval of a contract filed under this section shall be effective&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on the date the Commission expressly approves such contract, but in no event before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date such contract is filed or after the end of the 60-day period beginning on such date; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the Commission has not disapproved such contract by the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date such contract is filed, at the end of such 60-day period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Commission may limit the right of a rail carrier to enter into future contracts under this section following a determination that ad<!-- PDFPage:251 -->ditional contracts would impair the ability of the rail carrier to fulfill its common carrier obligations under section 11101 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Commission may not require a rail carrier to violate the terms of a contract that has been approved under this section, except to the extent necessary to comply with section 11128 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) A party to a contract entered into under this section shall have no duty in connection with services provided under such contract other than those duties specified by the terms of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) A contract that is approved by the Commission under this section, and transportation under such contract, shall not be subject to this subtitle, and may not be subsequently challenged before the Commission or in any court on the grounds that such contract violates a provision of this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The exclusive remedy for any alleged breach of a contract entered into under this section shall be an action in an appropriate State court or United States district court, unless the parties otherwise agree.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) The provisions of this section shall not affect the status of any lawful contract between a rail carrier and one or more purchasers of rail service that is in effect on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980. Any such contract shall hereafter have the same force and effect as if it had been entered into in accordance with the provisions of this section. Nothing in this section shall affect the rights of the parties to challenge the existence of such a contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) Any rail carrier may, in accordance with the terms of this section, enter into contracts for the transportation of agricultural commodities (including forest products, but not including wood pulp, wood chips, pulpwood or paper) involving the utilization of carrier owned or leased equipment not in excess of 40 percent of the capacity of such carrier's owned or leased equipment by major car type (plain boxcars, covered hopper cars, gondolas and open top hoppers, coal cars, bulkhead flatcars, pulpwood rackcars, and flatbed equipment, including TOFC/COFC), except that in the case of a proposed contract between a class I carrier and a shipper originating an average of 1,000 cars or more per year during the prior 3-year period by major car type on a particular carrier, not more than 40 percent of carrier owned or leased equipment utilized on the average during the prior 3-year period may be used for such contract without prior authorization by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may, on request of a rail carrier or other party or on its own initiative, grant such relief from the limitations of paragraph (1) of this subsection as the Commission considers appropriate, if it appears that additional equipment may be made available without impairing the rail carrier's ability to meet its common carrier obligations under section 11101 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) Service under a contract approved under this section shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct class of service, and the equipment used in the fulfillment of such a contract shall not be subject to car service decisions under section 11123 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) The Commission shall establish a railroad contract rate advisory service. The advisory service shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) compile and disseminate to interested parties nonconfidential summaries of the provisions of individual contract information relating to the provisions of contracts entered into under this section with regard to various goods, items, and commodities covered by such contracts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide the Commission and interested parties with advice regarding contracts; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) assess the impact on competition among shippers of variations between contract rates for various shipments and the published single car rates, and submit a report on such impact to the Congress not later than 90 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Except as provided in this section, the full applicable commercial rate shall be paid for transportation for the United States Government by a common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under this subtitle. Section 3709 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5) does not apply when transportation for the United States Government can be obtained from a common carrier lawfully operating in the area where the transportation will be provided. When prescribing rates for transportation or service by those common carriers, the Commission shall consider increased revenues those carriers receive under this subsection to reflect those increases in appropriate readjustments of their rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection does not apply, and the law related to compensation for <!-- PDFPage:252 -->transportation for the United States Government in effect immediately before September 18, 1940, applies to a rail carrier if that carrier, or its predecessor in interest, received a grant of land from the United States to aid in constructing the railroad it operates but did not file a release with the Secretary of the Interior before September 18, 1941, of claims against the United States Government to, or arising out of, lands that were granted, claimed to have been granted, or claimed should have been granted to that carrier or its predecessor in interest. This paragraph does not require a rail carrier to reconvey to the United States land patented or certified to it or prevent the patent of land that the Secretary of the Interior found was sold by the carrier to an innocent purchaser for value or as preventing the patent of land listed or selected by the carrier and finally approved by the Secretary of the Interior to the extent that issuance of those patents is authorized by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) A common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I, II, or III of chapter 105 of this title may transport individuals for the United States Government without charge or at reduced rates. The carriers may transport custom inspectors and immigration officers without charge. A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under chapter 105 of this title shall provide transportation for the United States Postal Service under chapters 50 and 52 of title 39, and may transport property for the United States Government, a State, or municipal government without charge or at reduced rates; except that any rates for the transportation of household goods for the United States Government shall not be predatory.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Unless a carrier is advised by the United States Government that disclosure of a quotation or tender of a rate established under paragraph (1) of this subsection for transportation provided to the United States Government would endanger the national security, the carrier shall file the quoted or tendered rate, including a retroactive rate made after the transportation has been provided, concurrently, with the Commission and the department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government for which the quotation or tender was made or for which the proposed transportation is to be provided. A carrier may quote or tender a rate established under an agreement made and approved under section 10706 of this title, but the exemption from the antitrust laws provided by that section applies only when the filing requirements of this paragraph are met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this subsection shall limit the Commission's authority to suspend and investigate proposed rates for the transportation of household goods for the United States Government on the basis that such rates constitute predatory practices in contravention of the transportation policy set forth in section 10101(a) of this title. However, pending final Commission action in a proceeding under section 10708 of this title to determine whether a proposed rate for the transportation of household goods for the United States Government under this subsection is predatory or not, the Commission may suspend the proposed rate under subsection (b) of such section 10708 only if it appears from specific facts shown by the verified complaint of a person that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) without suspension, the proposed rate will cause substantial injury to the complainant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it is likely that the complainant will prevail on the merits.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A different policy, rule of rate making, system of accounting, method of determining costs of transportation, value of property, or rate of return may not be applied to a water carrier owned or controlled by the United States Government than is applied to a water carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter III of chapter 105 of this title.</p>

A rate referred to in subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may not be established to cover the line-haul transportation between the principal concentration place and the principal break-bulk place.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before a carrier or freight forwarder may establish a rate for any service under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Commission may require such carrier or freight forwarder to have in effect and keep in effect, during any period such rate is in effect under such paragraph, a rate for such service which does not limit the liability of the carrier or freight forwarder.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:261 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) investigate the rate structure for the transportation of recyclable or recycled materials and competing virgin material by rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title and the manner in which that rate structure has been affected by successive general rate increases approved by the Commission for those carriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) determine whether those rate increases affect any part of the rate structure in violation of section 10701 or 10741 of this title and order the rate found to be in violation of either of those sections removed from the rate structure; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) report to the President and Congress, in each of the annual reports of the Commission for 1978 and 1979, and in other appropriate reports, all proceedings started or completed under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A determination under subsection (b)(2) of this section may be made only after a public hearing. During the hearing, the rail carriers have the burden of proving that rate increases that affect the rate structure applicable to the transportation of those competing materials comply with sections 10701 and 10741 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In cooperation with the Commission, the Secretary of Transportation shall maintain a research, development, and demonstration program to develop and improve transport terminal operations, transport service characteristics, transport equipment, and collection and processing methods to facilitate the competitive and efficient transportation of recyclable or recycled materials by rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle or any other law, within 90 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, all rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title shall take all actions necessary to reduce and thereafter maintain rates for the transportation of recyclable or recycled materials, other than recyclable or recycled iron or steel, at revenue-to-variable cost ratio levels that are equal to or less than the average revenue-to-variable cost ratio that rail carriers would be required to realize, under honest, economical, and efficient management, in order to cover total operating expenses, including depreciation and obsolescence, plus a reasonable and economic profit or return (or both) on capital employed in the business sufficient to attract and retain capital in amounts adequate to provide a sound transportation system in the United States. As long as any such rate equals or exceeds such average revenue-to-variable cost ratio established by the Commission, such rate shall not be required to bear any further rate increase. The Commission shall have jurisdiction to issue all orders necessary to enforce the requirements of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any rate established under this subsection must be available on a nonpreferential basis to shippers and must not result in charges to shippers which are predatory.</p>

The charges, if any, for such guarantee and penalty provision may vary to reflect one or more options available to meet a particular shipper's needs but must be contained in the tariff the carrier publishes for such service under this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before a carrier may establish a rate for any service under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Commission may require such carrier to have in effect and keep in effect, during any period such rate is in effect under such paragraph, a rate for such service which does not guarantee the pick up and delivery of household goods at the times specified in the contract for such services and which does not provide a penalty or per diem payment in the event the carrier fails to pick up or deliver household goods at the specified time.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) A common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may not charge or receive from a person a different compensation (by using a special rate, rebate, drawback, or another means) for a service rendered, or to be rendered, in transportation the carrier may perform under this subtitle than it charges or receives from another person for performing a like and contemporaneous service in the transportation of a like kind of traffic under substantially similar circumstances. A common carrier that charges or receives such a different compensation for that service unreasonably discriminates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under chapter 105 of this title may not subject a person, place, port, or type of traffic to unreasonable discrimination. However, subject to subsection (c) of this section, this subsection does not apply to discrimination against the traffic of another carrier providing transportation by any mode.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Differences between the rates, classifications, rules, and practices of water and rail common carriers in effect for their respective types of transportation do not constitute a violation of this section or an unfair or destructive competitive practice under this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Differences between rates, classifications, rules, and practices of rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title do not constitute a violation of this section if such differences result from different services provided by rail carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) This section shall not apply to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Liability for payment of rates for transportation for a shipment of property by a shipper or consignor to a consignee other than the shipper or consignor, is determined under this subsection when the transportation is provided by a rail, motor, or water common carrier under this subtitle. When the shipper or consignor instructs the carrier transporting the property to deliver it to a consignee that is an agent only, not having beneficial title to the property, the consignee is liable for rates billed at the time of delivery for which the consignee is otherwise liable, but not for additional rates that may be found to be due after delivery if the consignee gives written notice to the delivering carrier before delivery of the property&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) of the agency and absence of beneficial title; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:265 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) of the name and address of the beneficial owner of the property if it is reconsigned or diverted to a place other than the place specified in the original bill of lading.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the consignee is liable only for rates billed at the time of delivery under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the shipper or consignor, or, if the property is reconsigned or diverted, the beneficial owner, is liable for those additional rates regardless of the bill of lading or contract under which the property was transported. The beneficial owner is liable for all rates when the property is reconsigned or diverted by an agent but is refused or abandoned at its ultimate destination if the agent gave the carrier in the reconsignment or diversion order a notice of agency and the name and address of the beneficial owner. A consignee giving the carrier, and a reconsignor or diverter giving a rail carrier, erroneous information about the identity of the beneficial owner of the property is liable for the additional rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Liability for payment of rates for transportation for a shipment of property by a shipper or consignor, named in the bill of lading as consignee, is determined under this subsection when the transportation is provided by a rail or express carrier under this subtitle. When the shipper or consignor gives written notice, before delivery of the property, to the line-haul carrier that is to make ultimate delivery&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">that party is liable for the rates billed at the time of delivery and for additional rates that may be found to be due after delivery if that party does not pay the rates required to be paid under clause (2) of this subsection on delivery. However, if the party gives written notice to the delivering carrier before delivery that the party is not the beneficial owner of the property and gives the carrier the name and address of the beneficial owner, then the party is not liable for those additional rates. A shipper, consignor, or party to whom delivery is made that gives the delivering carrier erroneous information about the identity of the beneficial owner, is liable for the additional rates regardless of the bill of lading or contract under which the property was transported. This subsection does not apply to a prepaid shipment of property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A rail carrier may bring an action to enforce liability under subsection (a) of this section. That carrier must bring the action during the period provided in section 11706(a) of this title or by the end of the 6th month after final judgment against it in an action against the consignee, or the beneficial owner named by the consignee or agent, under that section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A water common carrier may bring an action to enforce liability under subsection (a) of this section. That carrier must bring the action by the end of the 2d year after the claim accrues or by end of the 6th month after final judgment against it in an action against the consignee or beneficial owner named by the consignee by the end of that 2-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A rail or express carrier may bring an action to enforce liability under subsection (b) of this section.

A motor common carrier (excluding a motor common carrier providing transportation of property, other than household goods, under an individually determined rate, classification, rule, or practice, as defined in section 10102(13), or in noncontiguous domestic trade) shall publish and file with the Commission tariffs containing the rates for transportation it may provide under this subtitle. The Commission may prescribe other information that motor common carriers (excluding a motor common carrier providing transportation of property, other than household goods, under an individually determined rate, classification, rule, or practice, as defined in section 10102(13), or in noncontiguous domestic trade) shall include in their tariffs. A motor contract carrier of property is not required to publish or file actual or minimum rates under this subtitle. Except as provided in the Negotiated Rates Act of 1993 and the amendments made by that Act, nothing in the Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act of 1994 (and the amendments made by that Act) creates any obligation for a shipper based solely on a rate that was on file with the Commission or elsewhere on the date of enactment of such Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Carriers that publish tariffs under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall keep them open for public inspection. A rate contained in a tariff filed by a common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II, III, or IV of chapter 105 shall be stated in money of the United States. A tariff filed by a motor or water contract carrier or by a household goods freight forwarder providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II, III, or IV of that chapter, respectively, may not become effective for 30 days after it is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A motor common carrier of property (other than a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods or in noncontiguous domestic trade) shall provide to the shipper, on request of the shipper, a written or electronic copy of the rate, classification, rules, and practices, upon which any rate agreed to between the shipper and carrier may have been based. When the applicability or reasonableness of the rates and related provisions billed by a motor common carrier is challenged by the person paying the freight charges, the Commission shall determine whether such rates and provisions are reasonable or applicable based on the record before it. In those cases where a motor common carrier (other than a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods or in noncontiguous domestic trade) seeks to collect charges in addition to those billed and collected which are contested by the payor, the carrier may request that the Commission determine whether any additional charges over those <!-- PDFPage:271 -->billed and collected must be paid. A carrier must issue any bill for charges in addition to those originally billed within 180 days of the original bill in order to have the right to collect such charges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If a shipper seeks to contest the charges originally billed, the shipper may request that the Commission determine whether the charges originally billed must be paid. A shipper must contest the original bill within 180 days in order to have the right to contest such charges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Any tariff on file with the Commission on the date of enactment of the Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act of 1994 not required to be filed with the Commission after the enactment of that Act is null and void beginning on that date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Commission shall prescribe the form and manner of publishing, filing, and keeping tariffs open for public inspection under this section. The Commission may prescribe specific charges to be identified in a tariff published by a common carrier providing transportation or service subject to its jurisdiction under subchapter I, III, or IV of that chapter, but those tariffs must identify plainly&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the places between which property and passengers will be transported;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) terminal, storage, and icing charges (stated separately) if a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of that chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) terminal charges if a common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter III or IV of that chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) privileges given and facilities allowed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) any rules that change, affect, or determine any part of the published rate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A joint tariff filed by a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of that chapter shall identify the carriers that are parties to it. The carriers that are parties to a joint tariff, other than the carrier filing it, must file a concurrence or acceptance of the tariff with the Commission but are not required to file a copy of the tariff. The Commission may prescribe or approve what constitutes a concurrence or acceptance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) When a common carrier (excluding a motor common carrier providing transportation of property other than household goods, under an individually determined rate, classification, rule, or practice defined in section 10102(13), or in a noncontiguous domestic trade) providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission (A) under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title proposes to change a rate, or (B) under another subchapter of that chapter proposes to change a rate, classification, rule, or practice, the carrier shall publish, file, and keep open for public inspection a notice of the proposed change as required under subsections (a) and (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When a contract carrier (except a motor contract carrier of property) providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II or III of chapter 105 of this title proposes to establish a new rate or to reduce a rate, directly or by changing a rule or practice related to the rate or the value of service under the rate, the carrier shall publish, file, and keep open for public inspection a notice of the new or reduced rate as required under subsections (a) and (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A notice filed under this subsection shall plainly identify the proposed change or new or reduced rate and indicate its proposed effective date. In the case of a carrier other than a rail carrier and motor common carrier of passengers with respect to special or charter transportation, a proposed rate change or a new or reduced rate may not become effective for 30 days after the notice is published, filed, and held open as required under subsections (a) and (b) of this section. In the case of a rail carrier, a proposed rate change resulting in an increased rate or a new rate shall not become effective for 20 days after the notice is published and a proposed rate change resulting in a reduced rate shall not become effective for 10 days after the notice is published, except that a contract authorized under section 10713 of this title shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of such section. In the case of a motor common carrier of passengers, a proposed rate change resulting in an increased rate or a new rate applicable to special or charter transportation shall not become effective for 30 days after the notice is published, and a proposed rate change resulting in a reduced rate applicable to special or charter transportation shall not become effective for 10 days after the notice is published.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Commission may reduce the notice period of subsections (a) and (c) of this section if cause exists. The Commission may change the other requirements of this section if cause exists in particular instances or as they apply to special circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may prescribe regulations for the simplification of tariffs by carriers providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title and permit them to change rates, classifications, rules, and practices without filing complete tariffs that cover matter that is not being changed when the Commission finds that action to be consistent with the public interest. Those carriers may publish new tariffs that incorporate changes or plainly indicate the proposed changes in the tariffs then in effect and kept open for public inspection. However, the Commission shall require that all rates of rail carriers and rail rate-making associations be incorporated in their individual tariffs by the end of the 2d year after initial publication of the rate, or by the end of the 2d year after a change in a rate becomes effective, whichever is later. The Commission may extend those periods if cause exists, but if it does, it must send a notice of the extension and a statement of the reasons for the extension to Congress. A rate not incorporated in an individual tariff as required by the Commission is void.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Commission may reject a tariff submitted to it by a common carrier under this section if that tariff violates this section or regulation of the Commission carrying out this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:272 --><p class="statutory-body">(f) The Commission may grant relief from this section to contract carriers when relief is consistent with the public interest and the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title. The Commission may begin a proceeding under this subsection on application of a contract carrier or group of contract carriers and on its own initiative for a water contract carrier or group of water contract carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Commission shall streamline and simplify, to the maximum extent practicable, the filing requirements applicable under this section to motor common carriers of property with respect to transportation provided under certificates to which the provisions of section 10922(b)(4)(E)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10762_1_target" name="10762_1">1</a></sup> of this title apply and to motor contract carriers of property with respect to transportation provided under permits to which the provisions of section 10923(b)(5)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10762_1_target" name="10762_1">1</a></sup> of this title apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Customer Account Codes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No tariff filed by a motor carrier of property with the Commission before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this subsection may be held invalid solely on the basis that a numerical or alpha account code is used in such tariff to designate customers or to describe the applicability of rates. For transportation performed on and after the 180th day following such date of enactment, the name of the customer for each account code must be set forth in the tariff (other than the tariff of a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Range Tariffs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No tariff filed by a motor carrier of property with the Commission before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this subsection may be held invalid solely on the basis that the tariff does not show a specific rate or discount for a specific shipment if the tariff is based on a range of rates or discounts for specific classes of shipments. For transportation performed on or after the 180th day following such date of enactment, such a range tariff must identify the specific rate or discount from among the range of rates or discounts contained in such range tariff which is applicable to each specific shipment or must contain an objective means for determining the rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Nothing in this section shall affect the application of the provisions of the Negotiated Rates Act of 1993 (or the amendments made by that Act) to undercharge claims for transportation provided prior to the date of enactment of the Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act of 1994.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) When a person delivers property to a rail carrier for transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, the person may direct the carrier to transport the property over an established through route. When competing rail lines constitute a part of the route, the person shipping the property may <!-- PDFPage:275 -->designate the lines over which the property will be transported. The designation must be in writing. A carrier may be directed to transport property over a particular through route when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there are at least 2 through routes over which the property could be transported;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a through rate has been established for transportation over each of those through routes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the carrier is a party to those routes and rates.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A carrier directed to route property transported under paragraph (1) of this subsection must issue a through bill of lading containing the routing instructions and transport the property according to the instructions. When the property is delivered to a connecting carrier, that carrier must also receive and transport it according to the routing instructions and deliver it to the next succeeding carrier or consignee according to the instructions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If no direction is made under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission may designate the route over which the property may be transported after arrival at the end of the route of one carrier or at a junction with the route of another carrier when the property is to be delivered to another carrier for further transportation. The Commission may act under this subsection when the public interest and a fair distribution of traffic require that action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission may prescribe exceptions to the authority of a person to direct the movement of traffic under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission shall notify the carrier, the Attorney General, and the chief executive officer of each State in which property being valued under this subchapter is located, of the completion of a tentative valuation of that property. The Commission may also notify other parties. The notice must be sent by certified mail and must indicate the valuation established for each of that carrier's classes of property. A valuation of property under this subchapter becomes final if a protest is not filed within 30 days after notice of the tentative valuation of that property is given. When the tentative valuation becomes final under this subsection, the effective date is the date of the tentative valuation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When a carrier files a protest of a tentative valuation, the Commission shall begin a proceeding to consider the protest. If the Commission decides that a tentative valuation should be changed, it may make the necessary changes. The tentative valuation, as changed, becomes final and is effective on the date of the final action of the Commission under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission shall publish final valuations and classifications of property established under this subchapter. A final valuation or classification that has become effective under this subchapter is prima facie evidence of the value of the property in a proceeding under this subtitle and in a judicial proceeding to enforce, enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend an action of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When evidence is introduced at the trial of an action involving a final valuation of property established by the Commission and found by the court to be different from the evidence offered to the Commission during a proceeding under subsection (b) of this section or in addition to that evidence and substantially affecting the valuation, the court shall send a copy of that evidence to the Commission and stay further proceedings in the action. The court may determine the duration of the stay of proceedings. The Commission shall consider the evidence and may change the final valuation established under this subchapter. The Commission shall complete its action and report to the court in the time determined by the court. If the Commission changes the valuation, the court must substitute the valuation as changed for the original valuation and give its judgment on the substituted valuation. If the Commission does <!-- PDFPage:282 -->not change the original valuation, the court must give judgment on the original valuation.</p>
