<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is made applicable to motor and water common carriers in view of 49:317(b) (proviso) and 906(c) (proviso). The words &ldquo;may provide transportation without charge&rdquo; are inserted for consistency. The words &ldquo;indigent or homeless individual&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;indigent, destitute, and homeless persons&rdquo; to eliminate redundancy. The words &ldquo;charitable organization&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;charitable and eleemosynary institutions&rdquo; to eliminate redundancy. The words &ldquo;Veterans&rsquo; Administration facility&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;National Homes&rdquo; since the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers was dissolved by the Act of July 3, 1930, ch. 863, &sect;&sect;1, 3, 5, 46 Stat. 1016, which provided for the consolidation of that Home and its functions in the Veterans&rsquo; Administration. The consolidation was carried out under Ex. Ord. No. 5398, July 21, 1930. The words &ldquo;soldiers&rsquo; and sailors&rsquo; home&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Soldiers&rsquo; and Sailors&rsquo; Homes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Soldiers&rsquo; and Sailors&rsquo; Orphan Homes&rdquo; as being more inclusive. The words &ldquo;confined to&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;inmates of&rdquo; as being more appropriate. Paragraph (2) is added in view of 49:317(b) (proviso), 906(c) (proviso), and 1005(c) (proviso). The words &ldquo;referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection&rdquo; are substituted for 49:22(1) (first sentence 28th&ndash;61st words and words between 1st and 2d semicolons) for consistency. Paragraph (2) is made applicable to subsection (a)(1)(D) in view of the words &ldquo;or for charitable purposes&rdquo; in 49:22(1). The words &ldquo;use in a public exhibition&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;to or from fairs and expositions for exhibition thereat&rdquo; to eliminate redundancy.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the word &ldquo;eleemosynary&rdquo; is omitted to eliminate redundancy. The word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;wrecks&rdquo; as being more appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;an accompanying guide or a dog trained to guide the individual&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;accompanied by a guide or seeing-eye dog or other dog specially trained for that purpose&rdquo; to eliminate redundancy. The words &ldquo;attendant when required because of the disability&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;by an attendant if such person is disabled to the extent of requiring such attendant&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;related rule&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;reasonable regulations&rdquo; for consistency. The words &ldquo;may establish&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;as may have been established by the carrier&rdquo; for clarity. The text of the provisos of 49:317(b), 906(c), and 1005(c) are omitted as unnecessary in view of the restatement.</p>
