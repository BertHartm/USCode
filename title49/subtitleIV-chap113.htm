<h3 class="section-head">&sect;11301. Authority of certain carriers to issue securities and assume obligations and liabilities</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; means a rail or sleeping car carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title (except a street, suburban, or interurban electric railway not operated as a part of a general railroad system of transportation), and a corporation organized to provide transportation by rail carrier subject to that subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;security&rdquo; means a share of capital stock, a bond, or other evidence of interest in, or indebtedness of, a carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Subject to the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.), and the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;1 et seq.), the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction to approve the issuance of securities by a carrier and the assumption of an obligation or liability related to the securities of another person by a carrier. A carrier may not issue securities or assume those obligations or liabilities without the approval of the Commission. No other approval is required. A security issued or obligation or liability assumed by a carrier in violation of this subsection or in violation of a condition prescribed by the Commission under subsection (d) of this section is void. However, a security or obligation issued or assumed under authority of this section is not void for failure to comply with a procedural requirement of this section or other matter preceding entry of the order of the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection does not apply to notes issued by a carrier if the notes mature not more than 2 years after their date of issue and total (with all then outstanding notes having a maturity of not more than 2 years) not more than 5 percent of the par value of the then outstanding securities of that carrier. If the securities do not have a par value, the par value of those securities is the fair market value on the date of issue. Paragraph (1) of this subsection applies to a subsequent funding of notes referred to in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A carrier issuing notes referred to in subsection (b)(2) of this section shall file a certificate of notification with the Commission by the end of the 10th day after they are issued. That notification must include substantially the same matter required by the Commission for an application for authority to issue other securities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A carrier that pledges, repledges, or otherwise disposes of a security referred to in an application for authority or a certificate of notification under this section as pledged or held unencumbered in the treasury of that carrier shall file a certificate of notification with the Commission by the end of the 10th day after it disposes of the security.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Commission may begin a proceeding under this section on application of a carrier. Before taking final action, the Commission must investigate the purpose and use of the securities issue or assumption and the proceeds from it. The Commission may approve any part of the application and may require the carrier to comply with appropriate conditions. After an application is approved under this section, the <!-- PDFPage:336 -->Commission may change a condition previously imposed or use that may be made of the securities or proceeds for good cause shown subject to the requirements of this section. The Commission may approve an application under this section only when it finds that the securities issue or assumption&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is for a lawful object within the corporate purpose of the carrier and reasonably appropriate for that purpose;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is compatible with the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is appropriate for or consistent with the proper performance by the carrier of service to the public as a common carrier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) will not impair the financial ability of the carrier to provide the service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An application or certificate must be made under oath and signed and filed for the carrier by a designated executive officer who knows the matters stated in the application or certificate. On receipt of an application of a carrier under this section, the Commission shall have a copy of the application served on the chief executive officer of each State in which that carrier operates. The appropriate authorities of those States are entitled to be admitted as parties to a proceeding under this section to represent the rights and interests of their people and States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Commission shall require a carrier that issues securities, including notes, under this section to submit reports to it. The reports must identify the disposition of those securities and the application of the proceeds from their disposition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) This section does not imply a guaranty or obligation of those securities by the United States Government. This section does not apply to securities issued or obligations or liabilities assumed by the United States Government, a State, or an instrumentality or political subdivision of one of them.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A security interest in a motor vehicle owned by, or in the possession and use of, a carrier having a certificate or permit issued under section 10922 or 10923 of this title and owing payment or performance of an obligation secured by that security interest is perfected in all jurisdictions against all general, and subsequent lien, creditors of, and all persons taking a motor vehicle by sale (or taking or retaining a security interest in a motor vehicle) from, that carrier when&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Notwithstanding sections 11343 and 11344 of this title, a carrier, or a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a rail, express, sleeping car, or pipeline carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title may not own, operate, control, or have an interest in a water common carrier or vessel carrying property or passengers on a water route with which it does or may compete for traffic.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may decide, after a full hearing, questions of fact related to competition or the possibility of competition under this subsection on application of a carrier. A carrier may file an application to determine whether an existing service violates this subsection and may request permission to continue operation of a vessel or that action be taken under subsection (b) of this section. The Commission may begin a proceeding under this subsection on its own initiative or on application of a shipper to investigate the operation of a vessel used by a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of that chapter if the carrier has not applied to the Commission and had the question of competition or the possibility of competition determined under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the Commission may authorize a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under that subchapter to own, operate, control, or have an interest in a water common carrier or vessel that is not operated through the Panama Canal and with which the carrier does or may compete for traffic when the Commission finds that ownership, operation, control, or interest will still allow that water common carrier or vessel to be operated in the public interest advantageously to interstate commerce and that it will still allow competition, without reduction, on the water route in question. However, section 11343 of this title also applies to a transaction or interest under this subsection if the transaction or interest is within the scope of that section. The Commission may begin a proceeding under this subsection on application of a carrier. An authorization under this subsection is not necessary for a carrier that obtained an order of extension before Sep<!-- PDFPage:340 -->tember 18, 1940, under section 5(21) of the Interstate Commerce Act (37 Stat. 567), as amended, if the order is still in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission may take action under this section only after a full hearing. An order entered as a result of the action may be conditioned on giving security for the payment of an amount of money or the discharge of an obligation that is required to be paid or discharged under that order.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A common carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I, II, or III of chapter 105 of this title may not agree or combine with another of those carriers to pool or divide traffic or services or any part of their earnings without the approval of the Commission under this section or sections 11124 and 11125 of this title. Except as provided in subsection (b) for agreements or combinations between or among motor common carriers of property, the Commission may approve and authorize the agreement or combination if the carriers involved assent to the pooling or division and the Commission finds that a pooling or division of traffic, services, or earnings&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) will be in the interest of better service to the public or of economy of operation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will not unreasonably restrain competition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Any motor common carrier of property may apply to the Commission for approval of an agreement or combination with another motor common carrier of property to pool or divide traffic or any services or any part of their earnings by filing such agreement or combination with the Commission not less than 50 days before its effective date. Prior to the effective date of the agreement or combination, the Commission shall determine whether the agreement or combination is of major transportation importance and whether there is substantial likelihood that the agreement or combination will unduly restrain competition. If the Commission determines that neither of these two factors exists, it shall, prior to such effective date and without a hearing, approve and authorize the agreement or combination, under such rules and regulations as the Commission may issue, and for such consideration between such carriers and upon such terms and conditions as shall be found by the Commission to be just and reasonable. If the Commission determines either that the agreement or combination is of major transportation importance or that there is a substantial likelihood that the agreement or combination will unduly restrain competition, the Commission shall hold a hearing concerning whether the agreement or combination will be in the interest of better service to the public or of economy in operation and whether it will unduly restrain competition and shall suspend operation of such agreement or combination pending such hearing and final decision thereon. After such hearing, the Commission shall indicate to what extent it finds that the agreement or combination will be in the interest of better service to the public or of economy in operation and will not unduly restrain competition and if assented <!-- PDFPage:343 -->to by all the carriers involved, shall, to that extent, approve and authorize the agreement or combination, under such rules and regulations as the Commission may issue, and for such consideration between such carriers and upon such terms and conditions as shall be found by the Commission to be just and reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of an application for Commission approval of an agreement or combination between a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods and its agents to pool or divide traffic or services or any part of their earnings, such agreement or combination shall be presumed to be in the interest of better service to the public and of economy in operation and not to restrain competition unduly if the practices proposed to be carried out under such agreement or combination are the same as or similar to practices carried out under agreements and combinations between motor common carriers providing transportation of household goods to pool or divide traffic or services or any part of their earnings approved by the Commission before the date of enactment of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall streamline, simplify, and expedite, to the maximum extent practicable, the process (including, but not limited to, any paperwork) for submission and approval of applications under this section for agreements and combinations between motor common carriers providing transportation of household goods and their agents.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;11343. Consolidation, merger, and acquisition of control</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The following transactions involving carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I (except a pipeline carrier), II, or III of chapter 105 of this title may be <!-- PDFPage:344 -->carried out only with the approval and authorization of the Commission:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consolidation or merger of the properties or franchises of at least 2 carriers into one corporation for the ownership, management, and operation of the previously separately owned properties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a purchase, lease, or contract to operate property of another carrier by any number of carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) acquisition of control of a carrier by any number of carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) acquisition of control of at least 2 carriers by a person that is not a carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) acquisition of control of a carrier by a person that is not a carrier but that controls any number of carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) acquisition by a rail carrier of trackage rights over, or joint ownership in or joint use of, a railroad line (and terminals incidental to it) owned or operated by another rail carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A person may carry out a transaction referred to in subsection (a) of this section or participate in achieving the control or management, including the power to exercise control or management, in a common interest of more than one of those carriers, regardless of how that result is reached, only with the approval and authorization of the Commission under this subchapter. In addition to other transactions, each of the following transactions are considered achievements of control or management:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A transaction by a carrier has the effect of putting that carrier and persons affiliated with it, taken together, in control of another carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A transaction by a person affiliated with a carrier has the effect of putting that carrier and persons affiliated with it, taken together, in control of another carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A transaction by at least 2 persons acting together (one of whom is a carrier or is affiliated with a carrier) has the effect of putting those persons and carriers and persons affiliated with any of them, or with any of those affiliated carriers, taken together, in control of another carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A person is affiliated with a carrier under this subchapter if, because of the relationship between that person and a carrier, it is reasonable to believe that the affairs of another carrier, control of which may be acquired by that person, will be managed in the interest of the other carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Approval and authorization by the Commission are not required if the only parties to a transaction referred to in subsection (a) of this section are motor carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title and the aggregate gross operating revenues of those carriers were not more than $2,000,000 during a period of 12 consecutive months ending not more than 6 months before the date of the agreement of the parties covering the transaction. However, the approval and authorization of the Commission is required when a motor carrier that is controlled by or affiliated with a carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of that chapter is a party to the transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The approval and authorization of the Commission are not required if the only parties to a transaction referred to in subsection (a) of this section are street, suburban, or interurban electric railways that are not controlled by or under common control with a carrier that is operated as part of a general railroad system of transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Notwithstanding any provisions of this title, the Interstate Commerce Commission, in a matter related to a motor carrier of property providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title, may exempt a person, class of persons, transaction, or class of transactions from the merger, consolidation, and acquisition of control provisions of this subchapter if the Commission finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the application of such provisions is not necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) either (i) the transaction is of limited scope, or (ii) the application of such provisions is not needed to protect shippers from the abuse of market power.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) At least 60 days before any transaction exempt under this subsection from the merger, consolidation, and acquisition of control provisions of this subchapter may take effect, each carrier intending to participate in such transaction shall file with the Commission a notice of its intention to participate in such transaction and shall give public notice of such intention. The Commission shall prescribe the information to be contained in such notices, including the nature and scope of the transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission, on its own initiative or on complaint, may revoke an exemption granted under this subsection, to the extent it specifies, when it finds that application of the provisions of this section to the person, class of persons, or transportation is necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Commission, on its own initiative, finds that employees of any carrier intending to participate in a transaction exempt under this subsection from the merger, consolidation, and acquisition of control provisions of this subchapter are or will be adversely affected by such transaction or if employees of such carrier adversely affected by such transaction file a complaint concerning such transaction with the Commission, the Commission shall revoke such exemption to the extent the Commission deems necessary to review and address the adverse effects on such employees.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission may begin a proceeding to approve and authorize a transaction referred to in section 11343 of this title on application of the person seeking that authority. When an application is filed with the Commission, the Commission shall notify the chief executive officer of each State in which property of the carriers involved in the proposed transaction is located and shall notify those carriers. If a motor carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title is involved in the transaction, the Commission must notify the persons specified in section 10328(b) of this title. The Commission shall hold a public hearing when a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of that chapter is involved in the transaction unless the Commission determines that a public hearing is not necessary in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In a proceeding under this section which involves the merger or control of at least two class I railroads, as defined by the Commission, the Commission shall consider at least the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effect of the proposed transaction on the adequacy of transportation to the public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the effect on the public interest of including, or failing to include, other rail carriers in the area involved in the proposed transaction.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:346 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the total fixed charges that result from the proposed transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the interest of carrier employees affected by the proposed transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) whether the proposed transaction would have an adverse effect on competition among rail carriers in the affected region.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In a proceeding under this section which involves only carriers of passengers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title, the Commission shall consider at least the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effect of the proposed transaction on the adequacy of transportation to the public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the effect on the public interest of including, or failing to include, other rail carriers in the area involved in the proposed transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the total fixed charges that result from the proposed transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the interest of carrier employees affected by the proposed transaction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission shall approve and authorize a transaction under this section when it finds the transaction is consistent with the public interest. The Commission may impose conditions governing the transaction. When the transaction contemplates a guaranty or assumption of payment of dividends or of fixed charges or will result in an increase of total fixed charges, the Commission may approve and authorize the transaction only if it finds that the guaranty, assumption, or increase is consistent with the public interest. When a rail carrier, or a person controlled by or affiliated with a rail carrier, is an applicant and the transaction involves a motor carrier, the Commission may approve and authorize the transaction only if it finds that the transaction is consistent with the public interest, will enable the rail carrier to use motor carrier transportation to public advantage in its operations, and will not unreasonably restrain competition. When a rail carrier is involved in the transaction, the Commission may require inclusion of other rail carriers located in the area involved in the transaction if they apply for inclusion and the Commission finds their inclusion to be consistent with the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In a proceeding under this section which does not involve the merger or control of at least two class I railroads, as defined by the Commission, the Commission shall approve such an application unless it finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) as a result of the transaction, there is likely to be substantial lessening of competition, creation of a monopoly, or restraint of trade in freight surface transportation in any region of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the anticompetitive effects of the transaction outweigh the public interest in meeting significant transportation needs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In making such findings, the Commission shall, with respect to any application that is part of a plan or proposal developed under section 333(a)&ndash;(d) of this title, accord substantial weight to any recommendations of the Secretary of Transportation. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to any proceeding under this section which involves only carriers of passengers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A rail carrier, or a person controlled by or affiliated with a rail carrier, together with one or more affected shippers, may apply for approval under this subsection of a transaction for the purpose of providing motor carrier transportation prior or subsequent to rail transportation to serve inadequately served shippers located on a railroad other than the applicant carrier. Such application shall be approved by the Commission if the applicants demonstrate presently impaired rail service and inadequate motor common carrier service which results in the serious failure of the rail carrier serving the shippers to meet the rail equipment or transportation schedules of shippers or seriously to fail otherwise to provide adequate normal rail services required by shippers and which shippers would reasonably expect the rail carrier to provide. The Commission shall approve or disapprove applications under this subsection within 30 days after receipt of such application. The Commission shall approve applications which are not protested by interested parties within 30 days following receipt of such application.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title or the Secretary of Transportation may apply, before January 1, 1982, for authority for and approval of a merger, consolidation, unification or coordination project (as described in section 333(c) of this title), joint use of tracks or other facilities, or acquisition or sale of assets involving one of those rail carriers, under this section instead of sections 11344 <!-- PDFPage:350 -->and 11345 of this title. The Secretary may apply under this section only when the parties to the application that are rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of that chapter consent to an application by the Secretary. A rail carrier may apply under this section only if it sent the proposed transaction to the Secretary for a report under section 11350 of this title at least 6 months before applying under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When the Commission notifies persons required to receive notice that an application has been filed under this section, the Commission must include in the notice a copy of the application, a summary of the proposed transaction, and the applicant's reasons and public interest justification for the transaction. When the Commission notifies the Secretary of Transportation that an application has been filed under this section, the Commission shall also request the report of the Secretary prepared under section 11350 of this title. By the 10th day after receiving an application under this section, the Commission shall send notice of the proposed transaction to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the chief executive officer of each State that may be affected by the execution or implementation of the proposed transaction;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Secretary of Labor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the Secretary of Transportation (unless the Secretary is the applicant under subsection (a) of this section).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission shall designate a panel of the Commission to make a recommended decision on each application under this section. The panel must begin a proceeding by the 90th day after the date the Commission receives the application, complete the proceeding by the 180th day after the application is referred to it, and give its recommended decision and certify the record to the entire Commission by the 90th day after the proceeding is completed. The panel may use employees appointed under section 3105 of title 5 and the Rail Services Planning Office in conducting the proceeding, evaluating the application and comments received about it, and determining whether it is in the public interest to approve and authorize the transaction under the last sentence of subsection (d) of this section. To carry out this subsection, the panel may make rules and rulings to avoid unnecessary costs and delay. In making its recommended decision, the panel shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) request the views of the Secretary of Transportation about the effect of the transaction on the national transportation policy, as stated by the Secretary, and consider the report submitted under section 11350 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) request the views of the Attorney General about the effect of the transaction on competition; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) request the views of the Secretary of Labor about the effect of the transaction on rail carrier employees, particularly whether the proposal contains adequate employee protection provisions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretaries and the Attorney General shall send their written views to the panel. Those statements are available to the public under section 552(a) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When the recommended decision and record of a proceeding under this section are certified to the entire Commission, it must hear oral argument on the matter certified to it and make a final decision by the 120th day after receiving the recommended decision and record. The Commission may extend a time period under subsection (c) of this section or under this subsection but must make its final decision by the end of the 2d year after receipt of the application by the Commission. The Commission shall consider the report of the Secretary of Transportation under section 11350 of this title in making its final decision. The final decision must be accompanied by a written opinion stating the reasons for the Commission action. The Commission may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) approve the transaction if the Commission determines the transaction is in the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) approve the transaction with conditions and modifications that it determines are in the public interest; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) disapprove the transaction if it determines the transaction is not in the public interest.</p>

The Commission may approve operation of motor carrier properties when it appears that failure to grant the approval may result in destruction of or injury to those motor carrier properties the person is seeking to acquire, or substantially interfere with their future usefulness in providing adequate and continuous service to the public. The Commission may approve the operation of water carrier properties only for good cause shown.</p>

The Commission may approve and authorize a carrier, as defined in section 11301(a)(1) of this title, to change (1) a part of a class of its securities, as defined in section 11301(a)(2) of this title, or (2) a part of an instrument under which a class of its securities is issued or a class of its obligations is secured. When a change is approved and authorized by the Commission under this subchapter, the carrier may carry out the change notwithstanding an express provision in the affected instrument or a State law and without getting other approval from the Commission or from a State authority. A person participating in carrying out a change that is approved and authorized under this subchapter is exempt from all other law, including State and municipal law, as necessary to let that person carry out the change.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may not approve an application filed under this section by a carrier that is in equity receivership or reorganization under subchapter IV of chapter 11 of title 11.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A power granted to a carrier under this subchapter changes its powers under its corporate charter and under State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) This subchapter does not affect the negotiability of a security of a carrier or of the obligation of a carrier that assumed liability related to a security. This subchapter does not apply to an equipment-trust certificate under which a carrier is obligated, to an evidence of indebtedness of a carrier the payment of which is secured solely by equipment, or to another instrument under which that equipment-trust certificate or evidence of indebtedness was issued or by which either of them is secured.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) will not be against the interests of a creditor of the carrier who is not affected by the change.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the change involves an issuance of securities, the Commission must also make the findings required under section 11301(d)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Commission shall begin a proceeding under this section on receipt of an application but may require an applicant to get assurances of assent to the change from the holders of the outstanding shares of the securities that will be affected by the change before continuing with the proceeding. The Commission may determine the percentage of the principal amount or number of those shares needed to establish assurance of assent to the change. A class of securities is considered to be affected by a proposed change only if the change is proposed to a part of that class or to a part of an instrument under which that class was issued or by which it is secured. However, if a proposed change is to an instrument under which at least 2 classes of securities were issued and are outstanding or secured by that instrument, only those classes to which the change is related are considered to be affected. The Commission shall divide the securities to be affected by a proposed change under this subchapter into reasonable classes for purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) On receipt of an application of a carrier under this section the Commission shall notify, and file a copy of the application with, the chief executive officer of each State in which that carrier operates. The appropriate authorities of those States are entitled to be admitted as parties to a proceeding under this section to represent the rights and interests of their people and States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The carrier must give notice of the proceeding to the holders of the class of securities affected. The Commission may direct the carrier to give notice to other persons the Commission determines to have an interest in the proceeding. The carrier may give notice under this subsection only after it gets assurances of assent when they are required under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Commission may impose conditions governing the proposed change. The Commission may determine the effective date for a change it approves and authorizes under this subchapter and may allow it to become effective on publication of a declaration to that effect by the carrier. After an application is approved, the Commission may change a condition imposed and impose supplemental requirements for good cause shown subject to the requirements of this subchapter.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) After making the findings required under section 11362(a) of this title, the Commission may approve and authorize the change if it is assented to by the holders of at least 75 percent of the aggregate principal amount or number of outstanding shares of each class of securities affected by the change. The Commission may increase the percentage required for assent under this subsection for a class of shares when an increase is in the public interest and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 75 percent of the shares in that class are held by less than 25 security holders; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that class is entitled to vote for the election of directors of the carrier and the Commission determines that the assent of at least 25 percent of the security holders of that class are controlled by the carrier or a person controlling the carrier.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The carrier may withdraw its application after the Commission makes the findings required under section 11362(a) of this title. If the application is not withdrawn, the Commission must require the carrier to submit the proposed change, with conditions imposed by the Commission, to the holders of each class of its securities affected by the change for their assent or rejection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In determining the percentage of outstanding securities when making a finding under section 11362(a) of this title, a security that secures an evidence of indebtedness of the carrier or of a company controlling or controlled by the carrier is considered to be outstanding unless the Commission determines that the proposed change does not materially affect the interest of the holder of that evidence of indebtedness. When that security is considered to be outstanding, assent to a proposed change may be given, notwithstanding another instrument, only&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if the security is pledged as security under an instrument under which an evidence of indebtedness was issued and is outstanding, by the holder of a majority of the principal amount of the evidence of indebtedness; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the security secures an evidence of indebtedness not issued under an instrument under which an evidence of indebtedness was issued, by the holder of the evidence of indebtedness.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to a submission required under subsection (a) of this section, the Commission shall require the carrier to submit a proposed change to a security referred to in this subsection, with requirements imposed by the Commission, to the holder of the evidence of indebtedness referred to in paragraph (1)(A) and (B) of this subsection as appropriate, for assent or rejection. A carrier is not required to submit the change to the trustee of the instrument referred to in that paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If the Commission determines that the assent of the holder of a security not entitled to vote for the election of directors of the carrier or an evidence of indebtedness is in the control of the carrier or of a person controlling the carrier, that security or evidence of indebtedness is not considered to be outstanding.</p>
