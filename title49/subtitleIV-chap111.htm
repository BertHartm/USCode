<p class="statutory-body">(a) A common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under chapter 105 of this title shall provide the transportation or service on reasonable request. In addition, a motor common carrier shall provide safe and adequate service, equipment, and facilities. A rail carrier shall not be found to have violated this section because it fulfills its commitments under contracts approved under section 10713 of this title before responding to reasonable requests for service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may prescribe requirements for continuous and adequate transportation and service provided by motor common carriers and household goods freight forwarders subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapters II and IV of chapter 105 of this title and for transportation of baggage and express by such motor common carriers of passengers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission may not regulate the duration of, or the amount of compensation payable under, an arrangement between a motor carrier and another party to use, with a driver, a motor vehicle not owned by that carrier to transport property when&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Interstate Commerce Commission may require terminal facilities, including main-line tracks for a reasonable distance outside of a terminal, owned by a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, to be used by another rail carrier if the Commission finds that use to be practicable and in the public interest without substantially impairing the ability of the rail carrier owning the facilities or entitled to use the facilities to handle its own business. The carriers are responsible for establishing the conditions and compensation for use of the facilities. However, if the carriers cannot agree, the Commission may establish conditions and compensation for use of the facilities under the principle controlling compensation in condemnation proceedings. The compensation shall be paid or adequately secured before a carrier may begin to use the facilities of another carrier under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A rail carrier whose terminal facilities are required to be used by another carrier under this section is entitled to recover damages from the other carrier for injuries sustained as the result of compliance with the requirement or for compensation for the use, or both, as appropriate, in a civil action, if it is not satisfied with the conditions for use of the facilities or if the amount of the compensation is not paid promptly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Commission may require rail carriers to enter into reciprocal switching agreements, where it finds such agreements to be practicable and in the public interest, or where such agreements are necessary to provide competitive rail service. The carriers entering into such an agreement shall establish the conditions and compensation applicable to such agreement, but, if the carriers cannot agree upon such conditions and compensation within a reasonable period of time, the Commission may establish such conditions and compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may require reciprocal switching agreements entered into by rail carriers pursuant to this subsection to contain provisions for the protection of the interests of employees affected thereby.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) The regulations and paperwork required of motor common carriers providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title shall be minimized to the maximum extent feasible consistent with the protection of individual shippers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Interstate Commerce Commission may issue regulations, including regulations protecting individual shippers, in order to carry out this subtitle with respect to the transportation of household goods by motor common carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Regulations of the Commission protecting individual shippers shall include, where appropriate, reasonable performance standards for the transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title. In establishing performance standards under this paragraph, the Commission shall take into account at least the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the level of performance that can be achieved by a well-managed motor common carrier transporting household goods;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the degree of harm to individual shippers which could result from a violation of the regulation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the need to set the level of performance at a level sufficient to deter abuses which result in harm to consumers and violations of regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) service requirements of the carriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the cost of compliance in relation to the consumer benefits to be achieved from such compliance; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:323 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the need to set the level of performance at a level designed to encourage carriers to offer service responsive to shipper needs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the Commission's authority to require reports from motor common carriers providing transportation of household goods or to require such carriers to provide specified information to consumers concerning their past performance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Every motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title may, upon request of a prospective shipper, provide the shipper with an estimate of charges for transportation of household goods and for the proposed services. The Commission shall not prescribe specific formulas, forms, methods, or techniques for providing a prospective shipper with such an estimate. The Commission shall not prohibit any such carrier from charging a prospective shipper for providing a written, binding estimate for the transportation and proposed services, nor shall the Commission require the final charges to a shipper to be based on an estimate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any charge for an estimate of charges provided by a motor common carrier to a shipper for transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title shall be subject to the antitrust laws, as defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Commission shall issue regulations that provide motor carriers providing transportation of household goods subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title with the maximum possible flexibility in weighing shipments, consistent with assurance to the shipper of accurate weighing practices. The Commission shall not prohibit such carriers from backweighing shipments or from basing their charges on the reweigh weights if the shipper observes both the tare and gross weighings (or, prior to such weighings, waives in writing the opportunity to observe such weighings) and such weighings are performed on the same scale.</p>

If the supply of available cars does not equal the requirements of the mines, the carrier shall maintain and apply reasonable ratings of the mines and count each car furnished to or used by a mine for transportation of coal against that mine. However, coal cars supplied by shippers or receivers are deemed not to be a part of the carrier's fleet and are not counted in determining a question about distribution or car count under subsection (b) of this section or section 10102, 10501, 10701&ndash;10703, 10707, 10721(b), 10722(c)&ndash;(d), 10723(a)&ndash;(b)(1), 10724(a), 10741&ndash;10744, 10746, 10749, 10750, 10901, 10902, 10907, 11101, 11103&ndash;11105, 11121&ndash;11125, 11127, 11128(a)(1), 11501(f), 11505(a), 11702(a)(1), 11703, 11901(d)&ndash;(e)(2), 11902, 11903, 11905, 11907, 11915, or 11916 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;unit-train service&rdquo; means the movement of a single shipment of coal of at least 4,500 tons, tendered to one carrier, on one bill of lading, at one origin, on one day, and destined to one consignee, at one plant, at one destination, over one route.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Unit-train service and non-unit-train service are deemed to be separate and distinct classes of service. A distinction shall be made between them and between the cars used in each class of service. A question about the reasonableness of, or discrimination in, the distribution of cars shall be determined within each class and not between them, notwithstanding a section referred to in subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Within two years after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, the Railroad Accounting Principles Board shall establish, for rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title, principles governing the determination of economically accurate railroad costs directly and indirectly associated with particular movements of goods, including the variable costs associated with particular movements of goods or such other costs as the Board believes most accurately represent the economic costs of such movements. Such principles shall govern the determination of all railroad costs for specific regulatory proceedings under this subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In developing cost accounting principles under this section, the Board shall take into account the following considerations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The specific regulatory purposes for which railroad costs are required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The degree of accuracy of the cost information which is needed to meet regulatory purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The existing capability and the probable future capability of rail carriers to provide such information and the relative benefits and costs of requiring development of additional capability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The means by which the degree of economic accuracy required can be obtained at the least possible expense and with the least possible information reporting.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The means by which the confidentiality of such costs can best be maintained while meeting the need for such information in regulatory proceedings.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The cost accounting principles established by the Board shall require that cost information be reported or disclosed only for the essential regulatory purposes defined by the Board.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Within 180 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, each rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter 105 of this title shall file with the Commission a request for preliminary certification of its cost accounting system. The Commission shall grant such preliminary certification if it determines that the cost accounting system of such rail carrier is in compliance with the accounting standards of the Commission in effect on the day prior to the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) As soon as practicable, but not later than 9 months, after the promulgation of rules by the Commission under section 11163 of this title, each rail carrier described in subsection (a) of this section shall file with the Commission a request for final certification of its cost accounting system developed to comply with this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within 90 days, or such additional time as the Commission finds necessary, after a rail carrier files its request for final certification under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Commission shall grant such final certification to such carrier if the Commission determines that the cost accounting system of such carrier is in compliance with the rules promulgated by the Commission under section 11163 of this title. If the Commission denies such final certification, the rail carrier shall revise its cost accounting system and file a new request for certification within 90 days after the date of such denial. The Commission shall thereupon grant final certification if it determines that such cost accounting system, as revised, is in compliance with such rules. If <!-- PDFPage:334 -->the Commission again denies final certification to the rail carrier, the Commission shall prescribe a cost accounting system which such carrier shall adopt within a reasonable time and which shall be considered a finally certified cost accounting system for purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Each rail carrier shall have and maintain a cost accounting system that is in compliance with the rules promulgated by the Commission under section 11163 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Certification under this section that the cost accounting system of a rail carrier is in compliance with the rules promulgated by the Commission under section 11163 of this title shall be valid until the promulgation of new rules by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After the cost accounting system of a rail carrier is certified under this section, such rail carrier may, after notifying the Commission, make modifications in such system unless, within 60 days after the date of notification, the Commission finds such modifications to be inconsistent with the rules promulgated by the Commission under section 11163 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) For purposes of determining whether the cost accounting system of a rail carrier is in compliance with the rules promulgated by the Commission, the Commission shall have the right to examine and make copies of any documents, papers, or records of such rail carrier relating to compliance with such rules. Such documents, papers, and records (and any copies thereof) shall not be subject to the mandatory disclosure requirements of section 552 of title 5.</p>

Such requirements shall be cost effective and compatible with and not duplicative of the managerial and responsibility accounting requirements of those carriers.
