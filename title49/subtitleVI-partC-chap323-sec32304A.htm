<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a national tire maintenance consumer education program including,<sup><a href="#32304A_1_target" name="32304A_1">1</a></sup> information on tire inflation pressure, alignment, rotation, and tread wear to maximize fuel efficiency, safety, and durability of replacement tires.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Report to Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall conduct periodic assessments of the rules promulgated under this section to determine the utility of such rules to consumers, the level of cooperation by industry, and the contribution to national goals pertaining to energy consumption.
