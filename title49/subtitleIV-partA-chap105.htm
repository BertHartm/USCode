Any proceeding begun as a result of an application under this subsection shall be completed within 9 months after it is begun.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Board may specify the period of time during which an exemption granted under this section is effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Board may revoke an exemption, to the extent it specifies, when it finds that application in whole or in part of a provision of this part to the person, class, or transportation is necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title.
