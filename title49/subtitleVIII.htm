<h3 class="section-head">&sect;60103. Standards for liquefied natural gas pipeline facilities</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Location Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe minimum safety standards for deciding on the location of a new liquefied natural gas pipeline facility. In prescribing a standard, the Secretary shall consider the&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) kind and use of the facility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) existing and projected population and demographic characteristics of the location;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) existing and proposed land use near the location;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) natural physical aspects of the location;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) medical, law enforcement, and fire prevention capabilities near the location that can cope with a risk caused by the facility; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) need to encourage remote siting.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Design, Installation, Construction, Inspection, and Testing Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe minimum safety standards for designing, installing, constructing, initially inspecting, and initially testing a new liquefied natural gas pipeline facility. When prescribing a standard, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the characteristics of material to be used in constructing the facility and of alternative material;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) design factors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the characteristics of the liquefied natural gas to be stored or converted at, or transported by, the facility; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the public safety factors of the design and of alternative designs, particularly the ability <!-- PDFPage:1050 -->to prevent and contain a liquefied natural gas spill.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Nonapplication</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a design, location, installation, construction, initial inspection, or initial testing standard prescribed under this chapter after March 1, 1978, does not apply to an existing liquefied natural gas pipeline facility if the standard is to be applied because of authority given&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) under this chapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) under another law, and the standard is not prescribed at the time the authority is applied.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Any design, installation, construction, initial inspection, or initial testing standard prescribed under this chapter after March 1, 1978, may provide that the standard applies to any part of a replacement component of a liquefied natural gas pipeline facility if the component or part is placed in service after the standard is prescribed and application of the standard&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) does not make the component or part incompatible with other components or parts; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) is not impracticable otherwise.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any location standard prescribed under this chapter after March 1, 1978, does not apply to any part of a replacement component of an existing liquefied natural gas pipeline facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A design, installation, construction, initial inspection, or initial testing standard does not apply to a liquefied natural gas pipeline facility existing when the standard is adopted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Operation and Maintenance Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe minimum operating and maintenance standards for a liquefied natural gas pipeline facility. In prescribing a standard, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the conditions, features, and type of equipment and structures that make up or are used in connection with the facility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the fire prevention and containment equipment at the facility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) security measures to prevent an intentional act that could cause a liquefied natural gas accident;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) maintenance procedures and equipment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the training of personnel in matters specified by this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) other factors and conditions related to the safe handling of liquefied natural gas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Effective Dates</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A standard prescribed under this section is effective on the 30th day after the Secretary of Transportation prescribes the standard. However, the Secretary for good cause may prescribe a different effective date when required because of the time reasonably necessary to comply with the standard. The different date must be specified in the regulation prescribing the standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Contingency Plans</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A new liquefied natural gas pipeline facility may be operated only after the operator submits an adequate contingency plan that states the action to be taken if a liquefied natural gas accident occurs. The Secretary of Energy or appropriate State or local authority shall decide if the plan is adequate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Effect on Other Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section does not preclude applying a standard prescribed under section 60102 of this title to a gas pipeline facility (except a liquefied natural gas pipeline facility) associated with a liquefied natural gas pipeline facility.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Opportunity To Present Views</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall give an interested person an opportunity to make oral and written presentations of information, views, and arguments when prescribing a standard under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Nonapplication</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A design, installation, construction, initial inspection, or initial testing standard does not apply to a pipeline facility existing when the standard is adopted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Preemption</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State authority that has submitted a current certification under section 60105(a) of this title may adopt additional or more stringent safety standards for intrastate pipeline facilities and intrastate pipeline transportation only if those standards are compatible with the minimum standards prescribed under this chapter. A State authority may not adopt or continue in force safety standards for interstate pipeline facilities or interstate pipeline transportation. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a State authority may enforce a requirement of a one-call notification program of the State if the program meets the requirements for one-call notification programs under this chapter or chapter 61.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) When continuity of gas service is affected by prescribing a standard or waiving compliance with standards under this chapter, the Secretary of Transportation shall consult with and advise the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or a State authority having jurisdiction over the affected gas pipeline facility before prescribing the standard or waiving compliance. The Secretary shall delay the effective date of the standard or waiver until the Commission or State authority has a reasonable opportunity to grant an authorization it considers necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In a proceeding under section 3 or 7 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717b or 717f), each applicant for authority to import natural gas or to establish, construct, operate, or extend a gas pipeline facility subject to an applicable safety standard shall certify that it will design, install, inspect, test, construct, operate, replace, and maintain a gas pipeline facility under those standards and plans for inspection and maintenance under section 60108 of this title. The certification is binding on the Secretary of Energy and the Commission except when an appropriate enforcement agency has given timely written notice to the Commission that the applicant has violated a standard prescribed under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Location and Routing of Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This chapter does not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe the location or routing of a pipeline facility.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Requirements and Submission</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in this section and sections 60114 and 60121 of this title, the Secretary of Transportation may not prescribe or enforce <!-- PDFPage:1052 -->safety standards and practices for an intrastate pipeline facility or intrastate pipeline transportation to the extent that the safety standards and practices are regulated by a State authority (including a municipality if the standards and practices apply to intrastate gas pipeline transportation) that submits to the Secretary annually a certification for the facilities and transportation that complies with subsections (b) and (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Contents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each certification submitted under subsection (a) of this section shall state that the State authority&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has regulatory jurisdiction over the standards and practices to which the certification applies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has adopted, by the date of certification, each applicable standard prescribed under this chapter or, if a standard under this chapter was prescribed not later than 120 days before certification, is taking steps to adopt that standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is enforcing each adopted standard through ways that include inspections conducted by State employees meeting the qualifications the Secretary prescribes under section 60107(d)(1)(C) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) is encouraging and promoting the establishment of a program designed to prevent damage by demolition, excavation, tunneling, or construction activity to the pipeline facilities to which the certification applies that subjects persons who violate the applicable requirements of that program to civil penalties and other enforcement actions that are substantially the same as are provided under this chapter, and addresses the elements in section 60134(b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) may require record maintenance, reporting, and inspection substantially the same as provided under section 60117 of this title;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) may enforce safety standards of the authority under a law of the State by injunctive relief and civil penalties substantially the same as provided under sections 60120 and 60122(a)(1) and (b)&ndash;(f) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Each certification submitted under subsection (a) of this section shall include a report that contains&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the name and address of each person to whom the certification applies that is subject to the safety jurisdiction of the State authority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) each accident or incident reported during the prior 12 months by that person involving a fatality, personal injury requiring hospitalization, or property damage or loss of more than an amount the Secretary establishes (even if the person sustaining the fatality, personal injury, or property damage or loss is not subject to the safety jurisdiction of the authority), any other accident the authority considers significant, and a summary of the investigation by the authority of the cause and circumstances surrounding the accident or incident;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the record maintenance, reporting, and inspection practices conducted by the authority to enforce compliance with safety standards prescribed under this chapter to which the certification applies, including the number of inspections of pipeline facilities the authority made during the prior 12 months; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) any other information the Secretary requires.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The report included in the first certification submitted under subsection (a) of this section is only required to state information available at the time of certification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Application</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A certification in effect under this section does not apply to safety standards prescribed under this chapter after the date of certification. This chapter applies to each applicable safety standard prescribed after the date of certification until the State authority adopts the standard and submits the appropriate certification to the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Monitoring</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may monitor a safety program established under this section to ensure that the program complies with the certification. A State authority shall cooperate with the Secretary under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Rejections of Certification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If after receiving a certification the Secretary decides the State authority is not enforcing satisfactorily compliance with applicable safety standards prescribed under this chapter, the Secretary may reject the certification, assert United States Government jurisdiction, or take other appropriate action to achieve adequate enforcement. The Secretary shall give the authority notice and an opportunity for a hearing before taking final action under this subsection. When notice is given, the burden of proof is on the authority to demonstrate that it is enforcing satisfactorily compliance with the prescribed standards.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Agreements Without Certification</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary of Transportation does not receive a certification under section 60105 of this title, the Secretary may make an agreement with a State authority (including a municipality if the agreement applies to intrastate gas pipeline transportation) authorizing it to take necessary action. Each agreement shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) establish an adequate program for record maintenance, reporting, and inspection designed to assist compliance with applicable safety standards prescribed under this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) prescribe procedures for approval of plans of inspection and maintenance substantially the same as required under section 60108 (a) and (b) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Agreements With Certification.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary accepts a certification under section 60105 and makes the determination required under this subsection, the Secretary may make an agreement with a State authority authorizing it to participate in the oversight of interstate pipeline transportation. Each such agreement shall include a plan for the State authority to participate in special investigations involving incidents or new construction and allow the State authority to participate in other activities overseeing interstate pipeline transportation or to assume additional inspection or investigatory duties. Nothing in this section modifies section 60104(c) or authorizes the Secretary to delegate the enforcement of safety standards for interstate pipeline facilities prescribed under this chapter to a State authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Determinations required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not enter into an agreement under this subsection, unless the Secretary determines in writing that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the agreement allowing participation of the State authority is consistent with the Secretary's program for inspection and consistent with the safety policies and provisions provided under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the interstate participation agreement would not adversely affect the oversight responsibilities of intrastate pipeline transportation by the State authority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the State is carrying out a program demonstrated to promote preparedness and risk prevention activities that enable communities to live safely with pipelines;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the State meets the minimum standards for State one-call notification set forth in chapter 61; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the actions planned under the agreement would not impede interstate commerce or jeopardize public safety.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Existing agreements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If requested by the State authority, the Secretary shall authorize a State authority which had an interstate agreement in effect after January 31, 1999, to oversee interstate pipeline transportation pursuant to the terms of that agreement until the Secretary determines that the State meets the requirements of paragraph (2) and executes a new agreement, or until December 31, 2003, whichever is sooner. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the Secretary, after affording the State notice, hearing, and an opportunity to correct any alleged deficiencies, from terminating an agreement that was in effect before enactment of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the State authority fails to comply with the terms of the agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) implementation of the agreement has resulted in a gap in the oversight responsibilities of intrastate pipeline transportation by the State authority; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) continued participation by the State authority in the oversight of interstate pipeline transportation has had an adverse impact on pipeline safety.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1054 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Notification.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each agreement shall require the State authority to notify the Secretary promptly of a violation or probable violation of an applicable safety standard discovered as a result of action taken in carrying out an agreement under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Response by secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a State authority notifies the Secretary under paragraph (1) of a violation or probable violation of an applicable safety standard, the Secretary, not later than 60 days after the date of receipt of the notification, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) issue an order under section 60118(b) or take other appropriate enforcement actions to ensure compliance with this chapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide the State authority with a written explanation as to why the Secretary has determined not to take such actions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Monitoring</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may monitor a safety program established under this section to ensure that the program complies with the agreement. A State authority shall cooperate with the Secretary under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Ending Agreements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Permissive termination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may end an agreement under this section when the Secretary finds that the State authority has not complied with any provision of the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Mandatory termination of agreement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall end an agreement for the oversight of interstate pipeline transportation if the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) implementation of such agreement has resulted in a gap in the oversight responsibilities of intrastate pipeline transportation by the State authority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the State actions under the agreement have failed to meet the requirements under subsection (b); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) continued participation by the State authority in the oversight of interstate pipeline transportation would not promote pipeline safety.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Procedural requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall give notice and an opportunity for a hearing to a State authority before ending an agreement under this section. The Secretary may provide a State an opportunity to correct any deficiencies before ending an agreement. The finding and decision to end the agreement shall be published in the Federal Register and may not become effective for at least 15 days after the date of publication unless the Secretary finds that continuation of an agreement poses an imminent hazard.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) A plan required under this subsection shall be made available to the Secretary or State authority on request under section 60117 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Inspection and Testing</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall inspect and require appropriate testing of a pipeline facility subject to this chapter that is not covered by a certification under section 60105 of this title or an agreement under section 60106 of this title. The Secretary shall decide on the frequency and type of inspection and testing under this subsection on a case-by-case basis after considering the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the location of the pipeline facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the type, size, age, manufacturer, method of construction, and condition of the pipeline facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the nature and volume of material transported through the pipeline facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the pressure at which that material is transported.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) climatic, geologic, and seismic characteristics (including soil characteristics) and conditions of the area in which the pipeline facility is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) existing and projected population and demographic characteristics of the area in which the pipeline facility is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) for a hazardous liquid pipeline facility, the proximity of the area in which the facility is located to an area that is unusually sensitive to environmental damage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) the frequency of leaks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) other factors the Secretary decides are relevant to the safety of pipeline facilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To the extent and in amounts provided in advance in an appropriation law, the Secretary shall decide on the frequency of inspection under paragraph (1) of this subsection. The Secretary may reduce the frequency of an inspection of a master meter system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Testing under this subsection shall use the most appropriate technology practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Pipeline Facilities Offshore and in Other Waters</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; means permanently removed from service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) &ldquo;pipeline facility&rdquo; includes an underwater abandoned pipeline facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) if a pipeline facility has no operator, the most recent operator of the facility is deemed to be the operator of the facility.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Not later than May 16, 1993, on the basis of experience with the inspections under section 3(h)(1)(A) of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 or section 203(<em>l</em>)(1)(A) of the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as appropriate, and any other information available to the Secretary, the Secretary shall establish a mandatory, systematic, and, where appropriate, periodic inspection program of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) all offshore pipeline facilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any other pipeline facility crossing under, over, or through waters where a substantial likelihood of commercial navigation exists, if the Secretary decides that the location of the facility in those waters could pose a hazard to navigation or public safety.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In prescribing standards to carry out subparagraph (A) of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Secretary shall identify what is a hazard to navigation with respect to an underwater abandoned pipeline facility; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for an underwater pipeline facility abandoned after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall include requirements that will lessen the potential that the facility will pose a hazard to navigation and shall consider the relationship between water depth and navigational safety and factors relevant to the local marine environment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary shall establish by regulation a program requiring an operator of a pipeline facility described in paragraph (2) of this subsection to report a potential or existing navigational hazard involving that pipeline facility to the Secretary through the appropriate Coast Guard office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The operator of a pipeline facility described in paragraph (2) of this subsection that discovers any part of the pipeline facility that is a hazard to navigation shall mark the location of the hazardous part with a Coast-Guard-approved marine buoy or marker and immediately <!-- PDFPage:1057 -->shall notify the Secretary as provided by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. A marine buoy or marker used under this subparagraph is deemed a pipeline sign or right-of-way marker under section 60123(c) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Secretary shall establish a standard that each pipeline facility described in paragraph (2) of this subsection that is a hazard to navigation is buried not later than 6 months after the date the condition of the facility is reported to the Secretary. The Secretary may extend that 6-month period for a reasonable period to ensure compliance with this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Not later than October 24, 1994, the Secretary shall establish standards on what is an exposed offshore pipeline facility and what is a hazard to navigation under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not later than 6 months after the Secretary establishes standards under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, or October 24, 1995, whichever occurs first, the operator of each offshore pipeline facility not described in section 3(h)(1)(A) of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 or section 203(<em>l</em>)(1)(A) of the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as appropriate, shall inspect the facility and report to the Secretary on any part of the facility that is exposed or is a hazard to navigation. This subparagraph applies only to a facility that is between the high water mark and the point at which the subsurface is under 15 feet of water, as measured from mean low water. An inspection that occurred after October 3, 1989, may be used for compliance with this subparagraph if the inspection conforms to the requirements of this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary may extend the time period specified in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph for not more than 6 months if the operator of a facility satisfies the Secretary that the operator has made a good faith effort, with reasonable diligence, but has been unable to comply by the end of that period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) The operator of a pipeline facility abandoned after October 24, 1992, shall report the abandonment to the Secretary in a way that specifies whether the facility has been abandoned properly according to applicable United States Government and State requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not later than October 24, 1995, the operator of a pipeline facility abandoned before October 24, 1992, shall report to the Secretary reasonably available information related to the facility, including information that a third party possesses. The information shall include the location, size, date, and method of abandonment, whether the facility has been abandoned properly under applicable law, and other relevant information the Secretary may require.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Implementation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 180 days after the completion of the memorandum of understanding required under subsection (a)(4), each agency represented on the Interagency Committee shall revise its regulations as necessary to implement the provisions of the memorandum of understanding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Savings Provisions; No Preemption</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section shall be construed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to require a pipeline operator to obtain a Federal permit, if no Federal permit would otherwise have been required under Federal law; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to preempt applicable Federal, State, or local environmental law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Interim Operational Alternatives.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this section, and subject to the limitations in paragraph (2), the Secretary of Transportation shall revise the regulations of the Department, to the extent necessary, to permit a pipeline operator subject to time periods for repair specified by rule by the Secretary to implement alternative mitigation measures until all applicable permits have been granted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The regulations issued by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection shall not allow an operator to implement alternative mitigation measures pursuant to paragraph (1) unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) allowing the operator to implement such measures would be consistent with the protection of human health, public safety, and the environment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the operator, with respect to a particular repair project, has applied for and is pursuing diligently and in good faith all required Federal, State, and local permits to carry out the project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the proposed alternative mitigation measures are not incompatible with pipeline safety.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Ombudsman</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall designate an ombudsman to assist in expediting pipeline repairs and resolving disagreements between Federal, State, and local permitting agencies and the pipeline operator during agency review of any pipeline repair activity, consistent with protection of human health, public safety, and the environment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>State and Local Permitting Processes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall encourage States and local governments to consolidate their respective permitting processes for pipeline repair projects subject to any time periods for repair specified by rule by the Secretary. The Secretary may request other relevant Federal agencies to provide technical assistance to States and local governments for the purpose of encouraging such consolidation.</p>
