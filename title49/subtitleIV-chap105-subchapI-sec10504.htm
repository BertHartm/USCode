<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(2), the defined term &ldquo;rail mass transportation&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;mass transportation services&rdquo; as being more precise and for consistency with the terms of the subtitle.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the introductory matter of subsection (b), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;The Interstate Commerce Commission does not have jurisdiction under this subtitle over&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;no local public body&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. be subject to the Interstate Commerce Act&rdquo; for clarity and to conform to the terms used in chapter 105 of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the word &ldquo;interstate&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;chief executive officer&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Governor&rdquo; as more appropriate in view of the definition of &ldquo;State&rdquo; that includes the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph&rdquo; and subparagraph (B) are omitted as unnecessary because the Commission does not have jurisdiction over safety, collective bargaining, and employee benefit matters, and those matters are covered by other provisions of title 49 related to the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
