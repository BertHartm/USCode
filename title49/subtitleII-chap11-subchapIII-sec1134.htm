<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Inspection, Testing, Preservation, and Moving of Aircraft and Parts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In investigating an aircraft accident under this chapter, the Board may inspect and test, to the extent necessary, any civil aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, or property on an aircraft involved in an accident in air commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any civil aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, or property on an aircraft involved in an accident in air commerce shall be preserved, and may be moved, only as provided by regulations of the Board.</p>

The examination or test shall be conducted in a way that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) does not interfere unnecessarily with transportation services provided by the owner or operator of the vehicle, vessel, rolling stock, track, or pipeline component; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the maximum extent feasible, preserves evidence related to the accident, consistent with the needs of the investigation and with the cooperation of that owner or operator.</p>
