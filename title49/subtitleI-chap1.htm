The duties and powers are derived from 2 sources.

<!-- field-start:miscellaneous-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 221 of Pub. L. 104&ndash;264 provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) In many respects the Administration is a unique agency, being one of the few non-defense government agencies that operates 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year, while continuing to rely on outdated technology to carry out its responsibilities for a state-of-the-art industry.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Until January 1, 1996, users of the air transportation system paid 70 percent of the budget of the Administration, with the remaining 30 percent coming from the General Fund. The General Fund contribution over the years is one measure of the benefit received by the general public, military, and other users of Administration's services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Administration must become a more efficient, effective, and different organization to meet future challenges.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The need to balance the Federal budget means that it may become more and more difficult to obtain sufficient General Fund contributions to meet the Administration's future budget needs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Congress must keep its commitment to the users of the national air transportation system by seeking to spend all moneys collected from them each year and deposited into the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Existing surpluses representing past receipts must also be spent for the purposes for which such funds were collected.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The aviation community and the employees of the Administration must come together to improve the system. The Administration must continue to recognize who its customers are and what their needs are, and to design and redesign the system to make safety improvements and increase productivity.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The Administration projects that commercial operations will increase by 18 percent and passenger traffic by 35 percent by the year 2002. Without effective airport expansion and system modernization, these needs cannot be met.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Absent significant and meaningful reform, future challenges and needs cannot be met.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The Administration must have a new way of doing business.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) There is widespread agreement within government and the aviation industry that reform of the Administration is essential to safely and efficiently accommodate the projected growth of aviation within the next decade.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) To the extent that Congress determines that certain segments of the aviation community are not required to pay all of the costs of the government services which they require and benefits which they receive, Congress should appropriate the difference between such costs and any receipts received from such segment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Prior to the imposition of any new charges or user fees on segments of the industry, an independent review must be performed to assess the funding needs and assumptions for operations, capital spending, and airport infrastructure.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) An independent, thorough, and complete study and assessment must be performed of the costs to the Administration and the costs driven by each segment of the aviation system for safety and operational services, including the use of the air traffic control system and the Nation's airports.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Because the Administration is a unique Federal entity in that it is a participant in the daily op<!-- PDFPage:26 -->erations of an industry, and because the national air transportation system faces significant problems without significant changes, the Administration has been authorized to change the Federal procurement and personnel systems to ensure that the Administration has the ability to keep pace with new technology and is able to match resources with the real personnel needs of the Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) The existing budget system does not allow for long-term planning or timely acquisition of technology by the Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) Without reforms in the areas of procurement, personnel, funding, and governance, the Administration will continue to experience delays and cost overruns in its major modernization programs and needed improvements in the performance of the air traffic management system will not occur.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) All reforms should be designed to help the Administration become more responsive to the needs of its customers and maintain the highest standards of safety.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Purposes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 222 of title II of Pub. L. 104&ndash;264 provided that: &ldquo;The purposes of this title [see Effective Date of 1996 Amendment note set out above] are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to ensure that final action shall be taken on all notices of proposed rulemaking of the Administration within 18 months after the date of their publication;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to permit the Administration, with Congressional review, to establish a program to improve air traffic management system performance and to establish appropriate levels of cost accountability for air traffic management services provided by the Administration;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to establish a more autonomous and accountable Administration within the Department of Transportation; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to make the Administration a more efficient and effective organization, able to meet the needs of a dynamic, growing industry, and to ensure the safety of the traveling public.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Preservation of Existing Authority</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 223(b) of title II of Pub.
