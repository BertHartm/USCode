<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13330, Feb. 24, 2004, 69 F.R. 9185, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to enhance access to transportation to improve mobility, employment opportunities, and access to community services for persons who are transportation-disadvantaged, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. This order is issued consistent with the following findings and principles:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) A strong America depends on citizens who are productive and who actively participate in the life of their communities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Transportation plays a critical role in providing access to employment, medical and health care, education, and other community services and amenities. The importance of this role is underscored by the variety of transportation programs that have been created in conjunction with health and human service programs, and by the significant Federal investment in accessible public transportation systems throughout the Nation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) These transportation resources, however, are often difficult for citizens to understand and access, and are more costly than necessary due to inconsistent and unnecessary Federal and State program rules and restrictions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) A broad range of Federal program funding allows for the purchase or provision of transportation services and resources for persons who are transportation-disadvantaged. Yet, in too many communities, these services and resources are fragmented, unused, or altogether unavailable.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Federally assisted community transportation services should be seamless, comprehensive, and accessible to those who rely on them for their lives and livelihoods. For persons with mobility limitations related to advanced age, persons with disabilities, and persons struggling for self-sufficiency, transportation within and between our communities should be as available and affordable as possible.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) The development, implementation, and maintenance of responsive, comprehensive, coordinated community transportation systems is essential for persons with disabilities, persons with low incomes, and older adults who rely on such transportation to fully participate in their communities.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Definitions</em>. (a) As used in this order, the term &ldquo;agency&rdquo; means an executive department or agency of the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) For the purposes of this order, persons who are transportation-disadvantaged are persons who qualify for Federally conducted or Federally assisted transportation-related programs or services due to disability, income, or advanced age.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Establishment of the Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council on Access and Mobility</em>. (a) There is hereby established, within the Department of Transportation for administrative purposes, the &ldquo;Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council on Access and Mobility&rdquo; (&ldquo;Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council&rdquo; or &ldquo;Council&rdquo;). The membership of the Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council shall consist of:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) the Secretaries of Transportation, Health and Human Services, Education, Labor, Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, and the Interior, the Attorney General, and the Commissioner of Social Security; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) such other Federal officials as the Chairperson of the Council may designate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary of Transportation, or the Secretary's designee, shall serve as the Chairperson of the Council. The Chairperson shall convene and preside at meetings of the Council, determine its agenda, direct its work, and, as appropriate to particular subject matters, establish and direct subgroups of the Council, which shall consist exclusively of the Council's members.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) A member of the Council may designate any person who is part of the member's agency and who is an officer appointed by the President or a full-time employee serving in a position with pay equal to or greater than the minimum rate payable for GS&ndash;15 of the General Schedule to perform functions of the Council or its subgroups on the member's behalf.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Functions of the Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council</em>. The Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) promote interagency cooperation and the establishment of appropriate mechanisms to minimize duplication and overlap of Federal programs and services so that transportation-disadvantaged persons have access to more transportation services;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) facilitate access to the most appropriate, cost-effective transportation services within existing resources;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) encourage enhanced customer access to the variety of transportation and resources available;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) formulate and implement administrative, policy, and procedural mechanisms that enhance transportation services at all levels; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) develop and implement a method for monitoring progress on achieving the goals of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Report</em>. In performing its functions, the Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council shall present to me a report not later than 1 calendar year from the date of this order. The report shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Identify those Federal, State, Tribal and local laws, regulations, procedures, and actions that have proven to be most useful and appropriate in coordinating transportation services for the targeted populations;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Identify substantive and procedural requirements of transportation-related Federal laws and regulations that are duplicative or restrict the laws&rsquo; and regulations&rsquo; most efficient operation;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Describe the results achieved, on an agency and program basis, in: (i) simplifying access to transportation services for persons with disabilities, persons with low income, and older adults; (ii) providing the most appropriate, cost-effective transportation services within existing resources; and (iii) reducing duplication to make funds available for more services to more such persons;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Provide recommendations to simplify and coordinate applicable substantive, procedural, and administrative requirements; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Provide any other recommendations that would, in the judgment of the Council, advance the principles set forth in section 1 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>General</em>. (a) Agencies shall assist the Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council and pro<!-- PDFPage:17 -->vide information to the Council consistent with applicable law as may be necessary to carry out its functions. To the extent permitted by law, and as permitted by available agency resources, the Department of Transportation shall provide funding and administrative support for the Council.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budget, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by a party against the United States, its departments, agencies, instrumentalities or entities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Internet Availability of Information</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;181, title IX, &sect;903, Apr. 5, 2000, 114 Stat. 196, provided that: &ldquo;The Administrator [of the Federal Aviation Administration] shall make available through the Internet home page of the Federal Aviation Administration the abstracts relating to all research grants and awards made with funds authorized by the amendments made by this Act [see Tables for classification]. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require or permit the release of any information prohibited by law or regulation from being released to the public.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 221 of Pub. L. 104&ndash;264 provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) In many respects the Administration is a unique agency, being one of the few non-defense government agencies that operates 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year, while continuing to rely on outdated technology to carry out its responsibilities for a state-of-the-art industry.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Until January 1, 1996, users of the air transportation system paid 70 percent of the budget of the Administration, with the remaining 30 percent coming from the General Fund. The General Fund contribution over the years is one measure of the benefit received by the general public, military, and other users of Administration's services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Administration must become a more efficient, effective, and different organization to meet future challenges.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The need to balance the Federal budget means that it may become more and more difficult to obtain sufficient General Fund contributions to meet the Administration's future budget needs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Congress must keep its commitment to the users of the national air transportation system by seeking to spend all moneys collected from them each year and deposited into the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Existing surpluses representing past receipts must also be spent for the purposes for which such funds were collected.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The aviation community and the employees of the Administration must come together to improve the system. The Administration must continue to recognize who its customers are and what their needs are, and to design and redesign the system to make safety improvements and increase productivity.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The Administration projects that commercial operations will increase by 18 percent and passenger traffic by 35 percent by the year 2002. Without effective airport expansion and system modernization, these needs cannot be met.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Absent significant and meaningful reform, future challenges and needs cannot be met.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The Administration must have a new way of doing business.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) There is widespread agreement within government and the aviation industry that reform of the Administration is essential to safely and efficiently accommodate the projected growth of aviation within the next decade.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) To the extent that Congress determines that certain segments of the aviation community are not required to pay all of the costs of the government services which they require and benefits which they receive, Congress should appropriate the difference between such costs and any receipts received from such segment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Prior to the imposition of any new charges or user fees on segments of the industry, an independent review must be performed to assess the funding needs and assumptions for operations, capital spending, and airport infrastructure.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:35 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) An independent, thorough, and complete study and assessment must be performed of the costs to the Administration and the costs driven by each segment of the aviation system for safety and operational services, including the use of the air traffic control system and the Nation's airports.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Because the Administration is a unique Federal entity in that it is a participant in the daily operations of an industry, and because the national air transportation system faces significant problems without significant changes, the Administration has been authorized to change the Federal procurement and personnel systems to ensure that the Administration has the ability to keep pace with new technology and is able to match resources with the real personnel needs of the Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) The existing budget system does not allow for long-term planning or timely acquisition of technology by the Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) Without reforms in the areas of procurement, personnel, funding, and governance, the Administration will continue to experience delays and cost overruns in its major modernization programs and needed improvements in the performance of the air traffic management system will not occur.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) All reforms should be designed to help the Administration become more responsive to the needs of its customers and maintain the highest standards of safety.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Purposes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 222 of title II of Pub. L. 104&ndash;264 provided that: &ldquo;The purposes of this title [see Effective Date of 1996 Amendment note set out above] are&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to permit the Administration, with Congressional review, to establish a program to improve air traffic management system performance and to establish appropriate levels of cost accountability for air traffic management services provided by the Administration;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to establish a more autonomous and accountable Administration within the Department of Transportation; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to make the Administration a more efficient and effective organization, able to meet the needs of a dynamic, growing industry, and to ensure the safety of the traveling public.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Preservation of Existing Authority</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 223(b) of title II of Pub.

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13180, Dec. 7, 2000, 65 F.R. 77493, as amended by Ex. Ord. No. 13264, June 4, 2002, 67 F.R. 39243, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to further improve the provision of air traffic services in ways that increase efficiency, take better advantage of new technologies, accelerate modernization efforts, and respond more effectively to the needs of the traveling public, while enhancing the safety, security, and efficiency of the Nation's air transportation system, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Establishment of the Air Traffic Organization</em>. (a) The Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) shall, consistent with his legal authorities, move to establish within the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) a performance-based organization to be known as the &ldquo;Air Traffic Organization&rdquo; (ATO).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The ATO shall be composed of those elements of the FAA's Air Traffic Services and Research and Acquisition organizations that have direct connection and give support to the provision of day-to-day operational air traffic services, as determined by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (Administrator). The Administrator may delegate responsibility for any operational activity of the air traffic control system to the head of the ATO. The Administrator's responsibility for general safety, security, and policymaking functions for the National Airspace System is unaffected by this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the Air Traffic Control System, established by the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (Air-21) (Public Law 106&ndash;181) [see Short Title of 2000 Amendments note set out under section 40101 of this title], shall head the ATO and shall report directly to the Administrator and be subject to the authority of the Administrator. The COO, in consultation with the Air Traffic Control Subcommittee of the Aviation Management Advisory Committee, shall enter into an annual performance agreement with the Administrator that sets forth measurable organization and individual goals in key operational areas and describes specific targets and how such goals will be achieved. The COO may receive an annual bonus not to exceed 30 percent of the annual rate of basic pay, based upon the Administrator's evaluation of the COO's performance in relation to the targets and goals described above.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The COO shall develop a 5-year strategic plan for the air traffic control system, including a clear statement of the mission and objectives for the system's safety, efficiency, and productivity. This strategic plan must ensure that ATO actions are consistent with long-term FAA strategies for the aviation system as a whole.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The COO shall also enter into a framework agreement with the Administrator that will establish the relationship of the ATO with the other organizations of the FAA.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Purpose</em>. The FAA's primary mission is to ensure the safety, security, and efficiency of the National Airspace System. The purpose of this order is to enhance that mission and further improve the delivery of air traffic services to the American public by reorganizing the FAA's air traffic services and related offices into a performance-based, results-oriented, organization. The ATO will be better able to make use of the unique procurement and personnel authorities that the FAA currently has and to better use the additional management reforms enacted by the Congress this year under Air-21. Specifically, the ATO shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) optimize use of existing management flexibilities and authorities to improve the efficiency of air traffic services and increase the capacity of the system;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) develop methods to accelerate air traffic control modernization and to improve aviation safety related to air traffic control;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) develop agreements with the Administrator of the FAA and users of the products, services, and capabilities it will provide;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) operate in accordance with safety performance standards developed by the FAA and rapidly respond to FAA safety and security oversight findings;</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) consult with its customers, the traveling public, including direct users such as airlines, cargo carriers, <!-- PDFPage:37 -->manufacturers, airports, general aviation, and commercial space transportation providers, and focus on producing results that satisfy the FAA's external customer needs;</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) consult with appropriate Federal, State, and local public agencies, including the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, to determine the best practices for meeting the diverse needs throughout the National Airspace System;</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) establish strong incentives to managers for achieving results; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) formulate and recommend to the Administrator any management, fiscal, or legislative changes necessary for the organization to achieve its performance goals.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Aviation Management Advisory Committee</em>. The Air Traffic Control Subcommittee of the Aviation Management Advisory Committee shall provide, consistent with its responsibilities under Air-21, general oversight to ATO regarding the administration, management, conduct, direction, and supervision of the air traffic control system.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Evaluation and Report</em>. Not later than 5 years after the date of this order, the Aviation Management Advisory Committee shall provide to the Secretary and the Administrator a report on the operation and effectiveness of the ATO, together with any recommendations for management, fiscal, or legislative changes to enable the organization to achieve its goals.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Definitions</em>. The term &ldquo;air traffic control system&rdquo; has the same meaning as the term defined by section 40102(a)(42) [now 40102(a)(47)] of title 49, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and is not intended to, nor does it, create any right to administrative or judicial review, or any right, whether substantive or procedural, enforceable by any party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The number of Federal and State commercial motor vehicle and operator inspections is insufficient and civil penalties for violators must be utilized to deter future violations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Department of Transportation is failing to meet statutorily mandated deadlines for completing rulemaking proceedings on motor carrier safety and, in some significant safety rulemaking proceedings, including driver hours-of-service regulations, extensive periods have elapsed without progress toward resolution or implementation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Too few motor carriers undergo compliance reviews and the Department's data bases and information systems require substantial improvement to enhance the Department's ability to target inspection and enforcement resources toward the most serious safety problems and to improve States&rsquo; ability to keep dangerous drivers off the roads.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Additional safety inspectors and inspection facilities are needed in international border areas to ensure that commercial motor vehicles, drivers, and carriers comply with United States safety standards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The Department should rigorously avoid conflicts of interest in federally funded research.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Meaningful measures to improve safety must be implemented expeditiously to prevent increases in motor carrier crashes, injuries, and fatalities.</p>
