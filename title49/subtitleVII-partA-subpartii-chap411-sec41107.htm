A copy of <!-- PDFPage:779 -->each certification and statement shall be posted for at least 20 days in the office of the Secretary.

<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;United States Postal Service&rdquo; and &ldquo;Postal Service&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Postmaster General&rdquo; in section 401(m) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Public Law 85&ndash;726, 72 Stat. 757) because of sections 4(a) and 6(<em>o</em>) of the Postal Reorganization Act (Public Law 91&ndash;375, 84 Stat. 773, 783). The words &ldquo;in foreign air transportation or between places in Alaska&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;between any points within the United States or between the United States and foreign countries&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and because 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(A) provides that 49 App.:1371(m) no longer applies to interstate or overseas air transportation (except transportation of mail between 2 places in Alaska). In addition, Congress did not intend to maintain the regulation of domestic air transportation of mail. See section 40102(a) of the revised title defining &ldquo;air transportation&rdquo; to mean interstate or foreign air transportation or the transportation of mail by aircraft. The word &ldquo;currently&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;opportunity for a&rdquo; are added for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words &ldquo;or certificates&rdquo; are omitted as surplus because of 1:1. The word &ldquo;modify&rdquo; is added for consistency in the revised title.</p>
