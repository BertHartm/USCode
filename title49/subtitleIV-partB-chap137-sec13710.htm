<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Reasonableness of rates; collecting additional charges</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the applicability or reasonableness of the rates and related provisions billed by a motor carrier is challenged by the person paying the freight charges, the Board shall determine whether such rates and provisions are reasonable under section 13701 or applicable based on the record before it.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Initiated by motor carriers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In those cases where a motor carrier (other than a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods or in noncontiguous domestic trade) seeks to collect charges in addition to those billed and collected which are contested by the payor, the carrier may request that the Board determine whether any additional charges over those billed and collected must be paid. A carrier must issue any bill for charges in addition to those originally billed within 180 days of the receipt of the original bill in order to have the right to collect such charges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Initiated by shippers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a shipper seeks to contest the charges originally billed or additional charges subsequently billed, the shipper may request that the Board determine whether the charges billed must be paid.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Resolution of Disputes Over Status of Common Carrier or Contract Carrier</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a motor carrier (other than a motor carrier providing transportation of household goods) that <!-- PDFPage:326 -->was subject to jurisdiction under subchapter II of chapter 105, as in effect on December 31, 1995, and that had authority to provide transportation as both a motor common carrier and a motor contract carrier and a dispute arises as to whether certain transportation that was provided prior to January 1, 1996, was provided in its common carrier or contract carrier capacity and the parties are not able to resolve the dispute consensually, the Board shall resolve the dispute.</p>
