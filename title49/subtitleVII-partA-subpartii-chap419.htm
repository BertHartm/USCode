<p class="note-body">In this section, the word &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;fix and determine&rdquo; and &ldquo;fixing and determining&rdquo; <!-- PDFPage:695 -->for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;fair and reasonable&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and to eliminate an unnecessary word. See the revision notes following 49:10101.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is substituted for 49 App.:1551(b)(1)(D) to make clear that the United States Postal Service derives its authority to provide for the transportation of mail by aircraft in interstate transportation from 39:5402(d) and (f). The text of 49 App.:1376(a) (1st sentence related to non-Alaska interstate and overseas air transportation less words between parentheses) is omitted as superseded by 39:5402(d).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;Except as provided in section 5402 of title 39&rdquo; are added for clarity. The words &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; in 49 App.:1376(a) are omitted as surplus. The text of 49 App.:1376(a) (2d, last sentences) is omitted as executed. In clauses (1) and (2), the word &ldquo;prices&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;rates of compensation&rdquo; for consistency in this part. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;an opportunity for a hearing on the record&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;hearing&rdquo; for clarity and consistency with subsection (f) of this section. The words &ldquo;to be paid by the Postal Service&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;The United States Postal Service shall make payments .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of so much of the total compensation as is fixed and determined by the Board under this section without regard to clause (3) of subsection (b) of this section&rdquo; in 49 App.:1376(c) to eliminate unnecessary words because the text of 49 App.:1376(b) (2d sentence words after 2d semicolon) is being omitted. See the revision notes for subsection (d) of this section. The words &ldquo;out of appropriations for the transportation of mail by aircraft&rdquo; are omitted as being superseded by chapters 20 and 24 of title 39, United States Code. The text of 49 App.:1376(c) (2d sentence) is omitted as expired because of 49 App.:1376(c) (last sentence). The text of 49 App.:1376(c) (last sentence) is omitted as executed. The words &ldquo;and to make such rates effective from such date as it shall determine to be proper&rdquo; in 49 App.:1376(a) are omitted because the power to determine when rates go into effect is included in the power to prescribe rates. The words &ldquo;transportation of mail by aircraft in foreign air transportation or between places in Alaska&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;transportation of mail by aircraft&rdquo; because 49 App.:1551(b)(1)(D) and (E) provides that transportation of mail in interstate or overseas air transportation (except transportation of mail between 2 places in Alaska) is transferred to the jurisdiction of the United States Postal Service leaving the balance of authority under 49 App.:1376(a) with the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (c), (d), and (f), reference to service provided by the Postal Service is omitted as obsolete because of 39:5402(d).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;In prescribing prices under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary&rdquo; are added for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the text of 49 App.:1376(b) (2d sentence words after 2d semicolon, 5th&ndash;7th sentences) and (d) is omitted as obsolete because under 49 App.:1376(c) and 1376a, payments by the Board under 49 App.:1376 were terminated. The text of 49 App.:1376(b) (3d, 4th sentences) is omitted as obsolete because it applies only to rates paid for service performed between October 24, 1978, and January 1, 1983. The text of 49 App.:1376(b) (last sentence) is omitted as executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (g) is substituted for 49 App.:1551(b)(3) and 1553(c) because the date on which the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to provide for the transportation of mail by aircraft expires is set out in 39:5402(f). The source provisions of 49 App.:1551(b)(3) providing for the transfer of that authority from the Secretary to the Postal Service are restated in section 5(k) of this bill.</p>
