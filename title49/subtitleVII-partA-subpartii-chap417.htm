<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Making Slots Available for Essential Air Service.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Operational authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If basic essential air service under subchapter II of this chapter is to be provided from an eligible point to a high density airport (other than Washington National Airport), the Secretary of Transportation shall ensure that the air carrier providing or selected to provide such service has sufficient operational authority at the high density airport to provide such service. The operational authority shall allow flights at reasonable times taking into account the needs of passengers with connecting flights.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If necessary to carry out the objectives of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall by order grant exemptions from the requirements of subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at high density airports), to air carriers using Stage 3 aircraft or to commuter air carriers, unless such an exemption would significantly increase operational delays.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Assurance of access</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary finds that an exemption under paragraph (2) would significantly increase operational delays, the Secretary shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that an air carrier providing or selected to provide basic essential air service is able to obtain access to a high density airport; except that the Secretary shall not be required to make slots available at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, if the number of slots available for basic essential air service (including slots specifically designated as essential air service slots and slots used for such purposes) to and from such airport is at least 132 slots.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Action by the secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall issue a final order under this subsection on or before the 60th day after receiving a request from an air carrier for operational authority under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Slots for Foreign Air Transportation.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary finds it to be in the public interest at a high density airport (other than Washington National Airport), the Secretary may grant by order exemptions from the requirements of subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at high density airports), to enable air carriers and foreign air carriers to provide foreign air transportation using Stage 3 aircraft.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Slot withdrawals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not withdraw a slot from an air carrier in order to allocate that slot to a carrier to provide foreign air transportation if the withdrawal of that slot would result in the withdrawal of slots from an air carrier at O'Hare International Airport under section 93.223 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, in excess of the total withdrawn from that air carrier as of October 31, 1993.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Equivalent rights of access</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall not take a slot at a high density airport from an air carrier and award such slot to a foreign air carrier if the Secretary determines that air carriers are not provided equivalent rights of access to airports in the country of which such foreign air carrier is a citizen.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Period of effectiveness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subsection and exemptions issued under this subsection shall cease to be in effect when the final rules issued under subsection (f) become effective.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Slots for New Entrants.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary finds it to be in the public interest and the circumstances to be exceptional, the Secretary may by order grant exemptions from the requirements under subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at high density airports), to enable new entrant air carriers to provide air transportation at high density airports (other than Washington National Airport).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Period of effectiveness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Exemptions issued under this subsection shall cease to be in effect on or after the date on which the final rules issued under subsection (f) become effective.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Special Rules for Washington National Airport.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding sections 6005(c)(5) and 6009(e) of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Act of 1986, or any provision of this section, the Secretary may, only under circumstances determined by the Secretary to be exceptional, grant by order to an air carrier currently holding or operating a slot at Washington National Airport an exemption from requirements under subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (pertaining to slots at Washington National Airport), to enable that carrier to provide air transportation with Stage 3 aircraft at Washington National Airport; except that such exemption shall not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) result in an increase in the total number of slots per day at Washington National Airport;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) result in an increase in the total number of slots at Washington National Airport from 7:00 ante meridiem to 9:59 post meridiem;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) increase the number of operations at Washington National Airport in any 1-hour period by more than 2 operations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) result in the withdrawal or reduction of slots operated by an air carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) result in a net increase in noise impact on surrounding communities resulting from changes in timing of operations permitted under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) continue in effect on or after the date on which the final rules issued under subsection (f) become effective.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on applicability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this subsection shall adversely affect Exemption No. 5133, as from time-to-time amended and extended.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Study.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<!-- PDFPage:576 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Matters to be considered</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall continue the Secretary's current examination of slot regulations and shall ensure that the examination includes consideration of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether improvements in technology and procedures of the air traffic control system and the use of quieter aircraft make it possible to eliminate the limitations on hourly operations imposed by the high density rule contained in part 93 of title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations or to increase the number of operations permitted under such rule;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the effects of the elimination of limitations or an increase in the number of operations allowed on each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) congestion and delay in any part of the national aviation system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the impact of noise on persons living near the airport;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) competition in the air transportation system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the profitability of operations of airlines serving the airport; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) aviation safety;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the impact of the current slot allocation process upon the ability of air carriers to provide essential air service under subchapter II of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the impact of such allocation process upon the ability of new entrant air carriers to obtain slots in time periods that enable them to provide service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the impact of such allocation process on the ability of foreign air carriers to obtain slots;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the fairness of such process to air carriers and the extent to which air carriers are provided equivalent rights of access to the air transportation market in the countries of which foreign air carriers holding slots are citizens;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the impact, on the ability of air carriers to provide domestic and international air service, of the withdrawal of slots from air carriers in order to provide slots for foreign air carriers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) the impact of the prohibition on slot withdrawals in subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section on the aviation relationship between the United States Government and foreign governments, including whether the prohibition in such subsections will require the withdrawal of slots from general and military aviation in order to meet the needs of air carriers and foreign air carriers providing foreign air transportation (and the impact of such withdrawal on general aviation and military aviation) and whether slots will become available to meet the needs of air carriers and foreign air carriers to provide foreign air transportation as a result of the planned relocation of Air Force Reserve units and the Air National Guard at O'Hare International Airport.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than January 31, 1995, the Secretary shall complete the current examination of slot regulations and shall transmit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives a report containing the results of such examination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Rulemaking</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall conduct a rulemaking proceeding based on the results of the study described in subsection (e). In the course of such proceeding, the Secretary shall issue a notice of proposed rulemaking not later than August 1, 1995, and shall issue a final rule not later than 90 days after public comments are due on the notice of proposed rulemaking.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Weekend Operations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall consider the advisability of revising section 93.227 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, so as to eliminate weekend schedules from the determination of whether the 80 percent standard of subsection (a)(1) of that section has been met.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;41733. Level of basic essential air service</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Decisions Made Before October</cap-smallcap> 1, 1988.&mdash;For each eligible place for which a decision was made before October 1, 1988, under section 419 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, establishing the level of essential air transportation, the level of basic essential air service for that place shall be the level established by the Secretary of Transportation for that place by not later than December 29, 1988.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Decisions Not Made Before October</cap-smallcap> 1, 1988.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall decide on the level of basic essential air service for each eligible place for which a decision was not made before October 1, 1988, establishing the level of essential air transportation, when the Secretary receives notice that service to that place will be provided by only one air carrier. The Secretary shall make the decision by the last day of the 6-month period beginning on the date the Secretary receives the notice. The Secretary may impose notice requirements necessary to carry out this subsection. Before making a decision, the Secretary shall consider the views of any interested community and the appropriate State authority of the State in which the community is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Until the Secretary has made a decision on a level of basic essential air service for an eligible place under this subsection, the Secretary, on petition by an appropriate representative of the place, shall prohibit an air carrier from ending, suspending, or reducing air transportation to that place that appears to deprive the place of basic essential air service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Availability of Compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Secretary decides that basic essential air service will not be provided to an eligible place without compensation, the Secretary shall provide notice that an air carrier may apply to provide basic essential air service to the place for compensation under this section. In selecting an applicant, the Secretary shall consider, among other factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the demonstrated reliability of the applicant in providing scheduled air service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the contractual and marketing arrangements the applicant has made with a larger carrier to ensure service beyond the hub airport;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the interline arrangements that the applicant has made with a larger carrier to allow passengers and cargo of the applicant at the hub airport to be transported by the larger carrier through one reservation, ticket, and baggage check-in;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the preferences of the actual and potential users of air transportation at the eligible place, giving substantial weight to the views of the elected officials representing the users; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) for an eligible place in Alaska, the experience of the applicant in providing, in Alaska, scheduled air service, or significant patterns of non-scheduled air service under an exemption granted under section 40109(a) and (c)&ndash;(h) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under guidelines prescribed under section 41737(a) of this title, the Secretary shall pay the rate of compensation for providing basic essential air service under this section and section 41734 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Compensation Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall pay compensation under this section at times and in the way the Secretary decides is appropriate. The Secretary shall end payment of compensation to an air carrier for providing basic essential air service to an eligible place when the Secretary decides the compensation is no longer necessary to maintain basic essential air service to the place.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall review periodically the level of basic essential air service for each eligible place. Based on the review and consultations with an interested community and the appropriate State authority of the State in which the community is located, the Secretary may make appropriate adjustments in the level of service.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Notice Required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier may end, suspend, or reduce air transportation to an eligible place below the level of basic essential air service established for that place under section 41733 of this title only after giving the Secretary of Transportation, the appropriate State authority, and the affected communities at least 90 days&rsquo; notice before ending, suspending, or reducing that transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Continuation of Service for</cap-smallcap> 30 <cap-smallcap>Days After Notice Period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If at the end of the notice period under subsection (a) of this section the Secretary has not found another air carrier to provide basic essential air service to the eligible place, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing notice to continue to provide basic essential air service to the place for an additional 30-day period or until another carrier begins to provide basic essential air service to the place, whichever occurs first.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Continuation of Service for Additional</cap-smallcap> 30-<cap-smallcap>Day Periods</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If at the end of the 30-day period under subsection (b) of this section the Secretary decides another air carrier will not provide basic essential air service to the place on a continuing basis, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing service to continue to provide service for additional 30-day periods until another carrier begins providing service on a continuing basis. At the end of each 30-day period, the Secretary shall decide if another carrier will provide service on a continuing basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Continuation of Compensation After Notice Period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If an air carrier receiving compensation under section 41733 of this title for providing basic essential air service to an eligible place is required to continue to provide service to the place under this section after the 90-day notice period under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall continue to pay that compensation after the last day of that period. The Secretary shall pay the compensation until the Secretary finds another carrier to provide the service to the place or the 90th day after the end of that notice period, whichever is earlier. If, after the 90th day after the end of the 90-day notice period, the Secretary has not found another carrier to provide the service, the carrier required to continue to provide that service shall receive compensation sufficient&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide the carrier an additional return that recognizes the demonstrated additional lost profits from opportunities foregone and the likelihood that those lost profits increase as the period during which the carrier is required to provide the service continues.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Compensation to Air Carriers Originally Providing Service Without Compensation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary requires an air carrier providing basic essential air service to an eligible place without compensation under section 41733 of this title to continue providing that service after the 90-day notice period required by subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall provide the carrier with compensation after the end of the 90-day notice period that is sufficient&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Transfer of Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If an air carrier, providing basic essential air service under section 41733 of this title between an eligible place and an airport at which the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration limits the number of instrument flight rule takeoffs and landings of aircraft, provides notice under subsection (a) of this section of an intention to end, suspend, or reduce that service and another carrier is found to provide the service, the Secretary shall require the carrier providing notice to transfer any operational authority the carrier has to land or take off at that airport related to the service to the eligible place to the carrier that will provide the service, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the carrier that will provide the service needs the authority; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the authority to be transferred is being used to provide air service to another eligible place.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Nonconsideration of Slot Availability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining what is basic essential air service and in selecting an air carrier to provide such service, the Secretary shall not consider as a factor whether slots at a high density airport are available for providing such service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Proposals and Decisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A State or local government may propose to the Secretary of Transportation that the Secretary provide compensation to an air carrier to provide air transportation to a place that is not an eligible place under this subchapter. Not later than 90 days after receiving a proposal under this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) decide whether to designate the place as eligible to receive compensation under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) approve the proposal if the State or local government or a person is willing and able to pay 50 percent of the compensation for providing the transportation, and notify the State or local government of the approval; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) disapprove the proposal if the Secretary decides the proposal is not reasonable under paragraph (2) of this subsection, and notify the State or local government of the disapproval and the reasons for the disapproval.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In deciding whether a proposal is reasonable, the Secretary shall consider, among other factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the traffic-generating potential of the place;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the cost to the United States Government of providing the proposed transportation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the distance of the place from the closest hub airport.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Approval for Certain Air Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, the Secretary shall approve a proposal under this section to compensate an air carrier for providing air transportation to a place in the 48 contiguous States or the District of Columbia and designate the place as eligible for compensation under this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) at any time before October 23, 1978, the place was served by a carrier holding a certificate under section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the place is more than 50 miles from the nearest small hub airport or an eligible place;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the place is more than 150 miles from the nearest hub airport; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:583 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the State or local government submitting the proposal or a person is willing and able to pay 25 percent of the cost of providing the compensated transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Level of Air Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Secretary designates a place under subsection (a)(1) of this section as eligible for compensation under this section, the Secretary shall decide, not later than 6 months after the date of the designation, on the level of air transportation to be provided under this section. Before making a decision, the Secretary shall consider the views of any interested community, the appropriate State authority of the State in which the place is located, and the State or local government or person agreeing to pay compensation for the transportation under subsection (b)(4) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After making the decision under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall provide notice that any air carrier that is willing to provide the level of air transportation established under paragraph (1) for a place may submit an application to provide the transportation. In selecting an applicant, the Secretary shall consider, among other factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the factors listed in section 41733(c)(1) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the views of the State or local government or person agreeing to pay compensation for the transportation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Compensation Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall pay compensation under this section when and in the way the Secretary decides is appropriate. The Secretary shall continue to pay compensation under this section only as long as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the air carrier maintains the level of air transportation established by the Secretary under subsection (c)(1) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the State or local government or person agreeing to pay compensation for transportation under this section continues to pay that compensation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary decides the compensation is necessary to maintain the transportation to the place.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may require the State or local government or person agreeing to pay compensation under this section to make advance payments or provide other security to ensure that timely payments are made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall review periodically the level of air transportation provided under this section. Based on the review and consultation with any interested community, the appropriate State authority of the State in which the community is located, and the State or local government or person paying compensation under this section, the Secretary may make appropriate adjustments in the level of transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Withdrawal of Eligibility Designations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After providing notice and an opportunity for interested persons to comment, the Secretary may withdraw the designation of a place under subsection (a)(1) of this section as eligible to receive compensation under this section if the place has received air transportation under this section for at least 2 years and the Secretary decides the withdrawal would be in the public interest. The Secretary by regulation shall prescribe standards for deciding whether the withdrawal of a designation under this subsection is in the public interest. The standards shall include the factors listed in subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Ending, Suspending, and Reducing Air Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An air carrier providing air transportation for compensation under this section may end, suspend, or reduce that transportation below the level of transportation established by the Secretary under this section only after giving the Secretary, the affected community, and the State or local government or person paying compensation under this section at least 30 days&rsquo; notice before ending, suspending, or reducing the transportation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) include expense elements based on representative costs of air carriers providing scheduled air transportation of passengers, property, and mail on aircraft of the type the Secretary decides is appropriate for providing the service or transportation for which compensation is being provided.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Promotional amounts described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection shall be a special, segregated element of the compensation provided to a carrier under this subchapter.</p>
