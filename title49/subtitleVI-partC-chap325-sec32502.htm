<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Cost Reduction and Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When prescribing a standard under this section, the Secretary shall design the standard to obtain the maximum feasible reduction of costs to the public, considering&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the costs and benefits of carrying out the standard;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Effective Date</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall prescribe an effective date for a standard under this section. That date may not be earlier than the date the standard is prescribed nor later than 18 months after the date the standard is prescribed. However, the Secretary may prescribe a later date when the Secretary submits to Congress and publishes the reasons for the later date. A standard only applies to a passenger motor vehicle or passenger motor vehicle equipment manufactured on or after the effective date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Research</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall conduct research necessary to carry out this chapter.</p>
