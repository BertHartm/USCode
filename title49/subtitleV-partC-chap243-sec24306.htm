<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Actions To Increase Revenues</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amtrak shall take necessary action to increase its revenues from the transportation of mail and express. To increase its revenues, Amtrak may provide auto-ferry transportation as part of the basic passenger transportation authorized by this part. When requested by Amtrak, a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government shall assist in carrying out this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Authority of Others To Provide Auto-Ferry Transportation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person primarily providing auto-ferry transportation and any other person not a rail carrier may provide auto-ferry transportation over any route under a certificate issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission if the Commission finds that the auto-ferry transportation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) will not impair the ability of Amtrak to reduce its losses or increase its revenues; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is required to meet the public demand.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A rail carrier that has not made a contract with Amtrak to provide rail passenger transportation may provide auto-ferry transportation over its own rail lines.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) State and local laws and regulations that impair the provision of auto-ferry transportation do not apply to Amtrak or a rail carrier providing auto-ferry transportation. A rail carrier may not refuse to participate with Amtrak in providing auto-ferry transportation because a State or local law or regulation makes the transportation unlawful.</p>
