<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the text of 49 App.:1608(c)(7) is omitted as surplus. The text of 49 App.:1608(c)(8) is omitted because the complete title of the Secretary of Transportation is used the first time the term appears in a section.

In clauses (3) and (10), the word &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;rule&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code and because the terms are synonymous. In clause (3)(B)(iii), the words &ldquo;of persons&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In clauses (4) and (5), the word &ldquo;mass&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;public&rdquo; because of the restatement.

The word &ldquo;municipalities&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. In clause (7), the words &ldquo;bus, or rail, or other&rdquo;, &ldquo;either publicly or privately owned&rdquo;, and &ldquo;on a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. basis&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. Clause (8) is added for clarity because the term &ldquo;net project cost&rdquo; has the same meaning throughout this chapter. In clause (11), the words &ldquo;the Commonwealths of&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. In clause (12), the word &ldquo;individuals&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;commuters or others&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (13)(A), the words &ldquo;in the case of any such area&rdquo; and &ldquo;entire&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;Secretary of Commerce&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Bureau of the Census&rdquo; because of 15:1511(e).
