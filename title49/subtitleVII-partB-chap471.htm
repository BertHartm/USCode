<h3 class="section-head">&sect;47101. Policies</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the safe operation of the airport and airway system is the highest aviation priority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that aviation facilities be constructed and operated to minimize current and projected noise impact on nearby communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to give special emphasis to developing reliever airports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that appropriate provisions should be made to make the development and enhancement of cargo hub airports easier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to encourage the development of intermodal connections on airport property between aeronautical and other transportation modes and systems to serve air transportation passengers and cargo efficiently and effectively and promote economic development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) that airport development projects under this subchapter provide for the protection and enhancement of natural resources and the quality of the environment of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) that airport construction and improvement projects that increase the capacity of facilities to accommodate passenger and cargo <!-- PDFPage:949 -->traffic be undertaken to the maximum feasible extent so that safety and efficiency increase and delays decrease;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) to ensure that nonaviation usage of the navigable airspace be accommodated but not allowed to decrease the safety and capacity of the airspace and airport system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) that artificial restrictions on airport capacity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are not in the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) should be imposed to alleviate air traffic delays only after other reasonably available and less burdensome alternatives have been tried; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) should not discriminate unjustly between categories and classes of aircraft;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) that special emphasis should be placed on converting appropriate former military air bases to civil use and identifying and improving additional joint-use facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) that the airport improvement program should be administered to encourage projects that employ innovative technology (including integrated in-pavement lighting systems for runways and taxiways and other runway and taxiway incursion prevention devices), concepts, and approaches that will promote safety, capacity, and efficiency improvements in the construction of airports and in the air transportation system (including the development and use of innovative concrete and other materials in the construction of airport facilities to minimize initial laydown costs, minimize time out of service, and maximize lifecycle durability) and to encourage and solicit innovative technology proposals and activities in the expenditure of funding pursuant to this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) that airport fees, rates, and charges must be reasonable and may only be used for purposes not prohibited by this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) that airports should be as self-sustaining as possible under the circumstances existing at each particular airport and in establishing new fees, rates, and charges, and generating revenues from all sources, airport owners and operators should not seek to create revenue surpluses that exceed the amounts to be used for airport system purposes and for other purposes for which airport revenues may be spent under section 47107(b)(1) of this title, including reasonable reserves and other funds to facilitate financing and cover contingencies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>National Transportation Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) It is a goal of the United States to develop a national intermodal transportation system that transports passengers and property in an efficient manner. The future economic direction of the United States depends on its ability to confront directly the enormous challenges of the global economy, declining productivity growth, energy vulnerability, air pollution, and the need to rebuild the infrastructure of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) United States leadership in the world economy, the expanding wealth of the United States, the competitiveness of the industry of the United States, the standard of living, and the quality of life are at stake.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A national intermodal transportation system is a coordinated, flexible network of diverse but complementary forms of transportation that transports passengers and property in the most efficient manner. By reducing transportation costs, these intermodal systems will enhance the ability of the industry of the United States to compete in the global marketplace.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) All forms of transportation, including aviation and other transportation systems of the future, will be full partners in the effort to reduce energy consumption and air pollution while promoting economic development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) An intermodal transportation system consists of transportation hubs that connect different forms of appropriate transportation and provides users with the most efficient means of transportation and with access to commercial centers, business locations, population centers, and the vast rural areas of the United States, as well as providing links to other forms of transportation and to intercity connections.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Intermodality and flexibility are paramount issues in the process of developing an integrated system that will obtain the optimum yield of United States resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The United States transportation infrastructure must be reshaped to provide the economic underpinnings for the United States to compete in the 21st century global economy. The United States can no longer rely on the sheer size of its economy to dominate international economic rivals and must recognize fully that its economy is no longer a separate entity but is part of the global marketplace. The future economic prosperity of the United States depends on its ability to compete in an international marketplace that is teeming with competitors but in which a full one-quarter of the economic activity of the United States takes place.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The United States must make a national commitment to rebuild its infrastructure through development of a national intermodal transportation system. The United States must provide the foundation for its industries to improve productivity and their ability to compete in the global economy with a system that will transport passengers and property in an efficient manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Capacity Expansion and Noise Abatement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is in the public interest to recognize the effects of airport capacity expansion projects on aircraft noise. Efforts to increase capacity through any means can have an impact on surrounding communities. Noncompatible land uses around airports must be reduced and efforts to mitigate noise must be given a high priority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Consistency With Air Commerce and Safety Policies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each airport and airway program should be carried out consistently with section 40101(a), (b), (d), and (f) of this title to foster competition, prevent unfair methods of competition in air transportation, maintain essential air transportation, and prevent unjust and discriminatory practices, including as the practices may be applied between categories and classes of aircraft.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Adequacy of Navigation Aids and Airport Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subchapter should be carried <!-- PDFPage:950 -->out to provide adequate navigation aids and airport facilities for places at which scheduled commercial air service is provided. The facilities provided may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) reliever airports; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) heliports designated by the Secretary of Transportation to relieve congestion at commercial service airports by diverting aircraft passengers from fixed-wing aircraft to helicopter carriers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Use of Safety Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subchapter should be carried out consistently with a comprehensive airspace system plan, giving highest priority to commercial service airports, to maximize the use of safety facilities, including installing, operating, and maintaining, to the extent possible with available money and considering other safety needs&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) electronic or visual vertical guidance on each runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) grooving or friction treatment of each primary and secondary runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) distance-to-go signs for each primary and secondary runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a precision approach system, a vertical visual guidance system, and a full approach light system for each primary runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a nonprecision instrument approach for each secondary runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) runway end identifier lights on each runway that does not have an approach light system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) a surface movement radar system at each category III airport;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) a taxiway lighting and sign system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) runway edge lighting and marking;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) radar approach coverage for each airport terminal area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) runway and taxiway incursion prevention devices, including integrated in-pavement lighting systems for runways and taxiways.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Intermodal Planning</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To carry out the policy of subsection (a)(5) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall take each of the following actions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Coordination in development of airport plans and programs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Cooperate with State and local officials in developing airport plans and programs that are based on overall transportation needs. The airport plans and programs shall be developed in coordination with other transportation planning and considering comprehensive long-range land-use plans and overall social, economic, environmental, system performance, and energy conservation objectives. The process of developing airport plans and programs shall be continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive to the degree appropriate to the complexity of the transportation problems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Goals for airport master and system plans</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Encourage airport sponsors and State and local officials to develop airport master plans and airport system plans that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) foster effective coordination between aviation planning and metropolitan planning;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) include an evaluation of aviation needs within the context of multimodal planning; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) are integrated with metropolitan plans to ensure that airport development proposals include adequate consideration of land use and ground transportation access.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Representation of airport operators on mpo's</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Encourage metropolitan planning organizations, particularly in areas with populations greater than 200,000, to establish membership positions for airport operators.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To carry out the policy of subsection (a)(6) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall consult with the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency about any project included in a project grant application involving the location of an airport or runway, or a major runway extension, that may have a significant effect on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) natural resources, including fish and wildlife;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) natural, scenic, and recreation assets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) water and air quality; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) another factor affecting the environment.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Except as otherwise provided in this chapter&rdquo; because subsections (b) and (c) restate the only parts of the chapter that provide exceptions to the general rule stated in subsection (a). In clauses (1) and (2), the words &ldquo;for a project&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;payable on account of any project contained in an approved project grant application submitted in accordance with this chapter&rdquo; in 49 App.:2209(a) and &ldquo;payable on account of any project contained in an approved project grant application&rdquo; in 49 App.:2209(b) for consistency in this chapter and to eliminate unnecessary words. A project cost is allowable only if it is incurred under a grant agreement made under the chapter, and a grant agreement may be made only if the project grant application is approved.

The words &ldquo;of the total of all lands therein&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter&rdquo; because subsections (a) and (b) are the only other parts of the chapter that specify the United States Government's share of allowable project costs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) if the cost is incurred after the grant agreement is executed and is for airport development or airport planning carried out after the grant agreement is executed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the cost is incurred after June 1, 1989, by the airport operator (regardless of when the grant agreement is executed) as part of a Government-approved noise compatability&nbsp;<sup><a href="#47110_1_target" name="47110_1">1</a></sup> program (including project formulation costs) and is consistent with all applicable statutory and administrative requirements;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) if the cost is not incurred in a project for airport development or airport planning for which other Government assistance has been granted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) if the total costs allowed for the project are not more than the amount stated in the grant agreement as the maximum the Government will pay (except as provided in section 47108(b) of this title); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) if the cost is for a project not described in section 47102(3) for acquiring for use at a commercial service airport vehicles and ground support equipment owned by an airport that include low-emission technology, but only to the extent of the incremental cost of equipping such vehicles or equipment with low-emission technology, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Certain Prior Costs as Allowable Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may decide that a project cost under subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section incurred after May 13, 1946, and before the date the grant agreement is executed is allowable if it is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) necessarily incurred in formulating an airport development project, including costs incurred for field surveys, plans and specifications, property interests in land or airspace, and administration or other incidental items that would not have been incurred except for the project; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the sponsor certifies that any needed airport development project affecting safety, security, or capacity will not be deferred because of the Secretary's approval.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Letters of Intent</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may issue a letter of intent to the sponsor stating an intention to obligate from future budget authority an amount, not more than the Government's share of allowable project costs, for an airport development project (including costs of formulating the project) at a primary or reliever airport. The letter shall establish a schedule under which the Secretary will reimburse the sponsor for the Government's share of allowable project costs, as amounts become available, if the sponsor, after the Secretary issues the letter, carries out the project without receiving amounts under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection applies to a project&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) about which the sponsor notifies the Secretary, before the project begins, of the sponsor's intent to carry out the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that will comply with all statutory and administrative requirements that would apply to the project if it were carried out with amounts made available under this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that meets the criteria of section 47115(d) and, if for a project at a commercial service airport having at least 0.25 percent of the boardings each year at all such airports, the Secretary decides will enhance system-wide airport capacity significantly.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A letter of intent issued under paragraph (1) of this subsection is not an obligation of the Government under section 1501 of title 31, and the letter is not deemed to be an administrative commitment for financing. An obligation or administrative commitment may be made only as amounts are provided in authorization and appropriation laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The total estimated amount of future Government obligations covered by all outstanding letters of intent under paragraph (1) of this subsection may not be more than the amount authorized to carry out section 48103 of this title, less an amount reasonably estimated by the Secretary to be needed for grants under section 48103 that are not covered by a letter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <cap-smallcap>Letters of intent</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not require an eligible agency to impose a passenger facility fee under section 40117 in order to obtain a letter of intent under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on statutory construction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the obligation of amounts pursuant to a letter of intent under this subsection in the same fiscal year as the letter of intent is issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Nonallowable Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section and section 47118(f) of this title, a cost is not an allowable airport development project cost if it is for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) constructing a public parking facility for passenger automobiles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) constructing, altering, or repairing part of an airport building, except to the extent the building will be used for facilities or activities directly related to the safety of individuals at the airport;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After making a project grant agreement under this subchapter and consulting with the sponsor, the Secretary of Transportation may decide when and in what amounts payments under the agreement will be made. Payments totaling not more than 90 percent of the United States Government's share of the project's estimated allowable costs may be made before the project is completed if the sponsor certifies to the Secretary that the total amount expended from the advance payments at any time will not be more than the cost of the airport development work completed on the project at that time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Recovering Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary determines that the total amount of payments made under a grant agreement under this subchapter is more than the Government's share of the total allowable project costs, the Government may recover the excess amount. If the Secretary finds that a project for which an advance payment was made has not been completed within a reasonable time, the Government may recover any part of the advance payment for which the Government received no benefit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Payment Deposits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A payment under a project grant agreement under this subchapter may be made only to an official or depository designated by the sponsor and authorized by law to receive public money.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Withholding Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may withhold a payment under a grant agreement under this subchapter for more than 180 days after the payment is due only if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notifies the sponsor and provides an opportunity for a hearing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) finds that the sponsor has violated the agreement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The 180-day period may be extended by&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:980 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) agreement of the Secretary and the sponsor; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the hearing officer if the officer decides an extension is necessary because the sponsor did not follow the schedule the officer established.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A person adversely affected by an order of the Secretary withholding a payment may apply for review of the order by filing a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the project is located. The petition must be filed not later than 60 days after the order is served on the petitioner.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) <cap-smallcap>Special rule for fiscal year 2006</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) and the absence of scheduled passenger aircraft service at an airport, the Secretary may apportion in fiscal year 2006 to the sponsor of the airport an amount equal to $500,000, if the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Existence and Amounts in Fund</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation has a discretionary fund. The fund consists of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) amounts subject to apportionment for a fiscal year that are not apportioned under section 47114(c)&ndash;(e) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 12.5 percent of amounts not apportioned under section 47114 of this title because of section 47114(f).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Availability of Amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to subsection (c) of this section and section 47117(e) of this title, the fund is available for making grants for any purpose for which amounts are made available under section 48103 of this title that the Secretary considers most appropriate to carry out this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Minimum Percentage for Primary and Reliever Airports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At least 75 percent of the amount in the fund and distributed by the Secretary in a fiscal year shall be used for making grants&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to preserve and enhance capacity, safety, and security at primary and reliever airports; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to carry out airport noise compatibility planning and programs at primary and reliever airports.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Considerations.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>For capacity enhancement projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In selecting a project for a grant to preserve and improve capacity funded in whole or in part from the fund, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the effect that the project will have on overall national transportation system capacity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the benefit and cost of the project, including, in the case of a project at a reliever airport, the number of operations projected to be diverted from a primary airport to the reliever airport as a result of the project, as well as the cost savings projected to be realized by users of the local airport system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the financial commitment from non-United States Government sources to preserve or improve airport capacity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the airport improvement priorities of the States to the extent such priorities are not in conflict with subparagraphs (A) and (B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the projected growth in the number of passengers or aircraft that will be using the airport at which the project will be carried out; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the ability of the project to foster United States competitiveness in securing global air cargo activity at a United States airport.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>For all projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In selecting a project for a grant under this section, the Secretary shall consider among other factors whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) funding has been provided for all other projects qualifying for funding during the fiscal year under this chapter that have attained a higher score under the numerical priority system employed by the Secretary in administering the fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the sponsor will be able to commence the work identified in the project applica<!-- PDFPage:987 -->tion in the fiscal year in which the grant is made or within 6 months after the grant is made, whichever is later.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Waiving Percentage Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary decides the Secretary cannot comply with the percentage requirement of subsection (c) of this section in a fiscal year because there are insufficient qualified grant applications to meet that percentage, the amount the Secretary determines will not be distributed as required by subsection (c) is available for obligation during the fiscal year without regard to the requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Consideration of Diversion of Revenues in Awarding Discretionary Grants.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>General rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to paragraph (2), in deciding whether or not to distribute funds to an airport from the discretionary funds established by subsection (a) of this section and section 47116 of this title, the Secretary shall consider as a factor militating against the distribution of such funds to the airport the fact that the airport is using revenues generated by the airport or by local taxes on aviation fuel for purposes other than capital or operating costs of the airport or the local airports system or other local facilities which are owned or operated by the owner or operator of the airport and directly and substantially related to the actual air transportation of passengers or property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Required finding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Paragraph (1) shall apply only when the Secretary finds that the amount of revenues used by the airport for purposes other than capital or operating costs in the airport's fiscal year preceding the date of the application for discretionary funds exceeds the amount of such revenues in the airport's first fiscal year ending after August 23, 1994, adjusted by the Secretary for changes in the Consumer Price Index of All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Minimum Amount To Be Credited.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>General rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In a fiscal year, there shall be credited to the fund, out of amounts made available under section 48103 of this title, an amount that is at least equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) $148,000,000; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the total amount required from the fund to carry out in the fiscal year letters of intent issued before January 1, 1996, under section 47110(e) of this title or the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The amount credited is exclusive of amounts that have been apportioned in a prior fiscal year under section 47114 of this title and that remain available for obligation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Reduction of apportionments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In a fiscal year in which the amount credited under subsection (a) is less than the minimum amount to be credited under paragraph (1), the total amount calculated under paragraph (3) shall be reduced by an amount that, when credited to the fund, together with the amount credited under subsection (a), equals such minimum amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Amount of reduction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For a fiscal year, the total amount available to make a reduction to carry out paragraph (2) is the total of the amounts determined under sections 47114(c)(1)(A), 47114(c)(2), 47114(d), and 47117(e) of this title. Each amount shall be reduced by an equal percentage to achieve the reduction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Priority for Letters of Intent</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In making grants in a fiscal year with funds made available under this section, the Secretary shall fulfill intentions to obligate under section 47110(e).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Considerations for Project Under Expanded Security Eligibility</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In order to assure that funding under this subchapter is provided to the greatest needs, the Secretary, in selecting a project described in section 47102(3)(J)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#47115_1_target" name="47115_1">1</a></sup> for a grant, shall consider the non-federal&nbsp;<sup><a href="#47115_2_target" name="47115_2">2</a></sup> resources available to sponsor, the use of such non-federal&nbsp;<sup><a href="#47115_2_target" name="47115_2">2</a></sup> resources, and the degree to which the sponsor is providing increased funding for the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For fiscal years 2004 through 2007, the sponsors of airports located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, and Republic of Palau shall be eligible for grants under this section and section 47116.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Period of Availability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An amount apportioned under section 47114 of this title is available to be obligated for grants under the apportionment only during the fiscal year for which the amount was apportioned and the 2 fiscal years immediately after that year or the 3 fiscal years immediately following that year in the case of a nonhub airport or any airport that is not a commercial service airport. If the amount is not obligated under the apportionment within that time, it shall be added to the discretionary fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Primary Airports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An amount apportioned to a sponsor of a primary airport under <!-- PDFPage:990 -->section 47114(c)(1) of this title is available for grants for any public-use airport of the sponsor included in the national plan of integrated airport systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <cap-smallcap>Waiver</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A sponsor of an airport may make an agreement with the Secretary of Transportation waiving the sponsor's claim to any part of the amount apportioned for the airport under sections 47114(c) and 47114(d)(3)(A) if the Secretary agrees to make the waived amount available for a grant for another public-use airport in the same State or geographical area as the airport, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>State Use</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An amount apportioned to a State under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) section 47114(d)(2)(A) of this title is available for grants for airports located in the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) section 47114(d)(2)(B) or (C) of this title is available for grants for airports described in section 47114(d)(2)(B) or (C) and located in the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Special Apportionment Categories</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary shall use amounts available to the discretionary fund under section 47115 of this title for each fiscal year as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) At least 35 percent for grants for airport noise compatibility planning under section 47505(a)(2), for carrying out noise compatibility programs under section 47504(c), for noise mitigation projects approved in an environmental record of decision for an airport development project under this title, for compatible land use planning and projects carried out by State and local governments under section 47141, and for airport development described in section 47102(3)(F), 47102(3)(K), or 47102(3)(L) to comply with the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.). The Secretary may count the amount of grants made for such planning and programs with funds apportioned under section 47114 in that fiscal year in determining whether or not such 35 percent requirement is being met in that fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) at&nbsp;<sup><a href="#47117_1_target" name="47117_1">1</a></sup> least 4 percent to sponsors of current or former military airports designated by the Secretary under section 47118(a) of this title for grants for developing current and former military airports to improve the capacity of the national air transportation system and to sponsors of noncommercial service airports for grants for operational and maintenance expenses at any such airport if the amount of such grants to the sponsor of the airport does not exceed $30,000 in that fiscal year, if the Secretary determines that the airport is adversely affected by the closure or realignment of a military base, and if the sponsor of the airport certifies that the airport would otherwise close if the airport does not receive the grant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) In any fiscal year in which the total amount made available under section 48103 is $3,200,000,000 or more, at least two-thirds of 1 percent for grants to sponsors of reliever airports which have&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) more than 75,000 annual operations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a runway with a minimum usable landing distance of 5,000 feet;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) a precision instrument landing procedure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) a minimum number of aircraft, to be determined by the Secretary, based at the airport; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) been designated by the Secretary as a reliever airport to an airport with 20,000 hours of annual delays in commercial passenger aircraft takeoffs and landings.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary decides that an amount required to be used for grants under paragraph (1) of this subsection cannot be used for a fiscal year because there are insufficient qualified grant applications, the amount the Secretary determines cannot be used is available during the fiscal year for grants for other airports or for other purposes for which amounts are authorized for grants under section 48103 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Priority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall give priority in making grants under paragraph (1)(A) to applications for airport noise compatibility planning and programs at and around&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to paragraph (2), if the Secretary finds that all or part of an amount of an apportionment under section 47114 is not required during a fiscal year to fund a grant for which the apportionment may be used, the Secretary may use during such fiscal year the amount not so required to make grants for any purpose for which grants may be made under section 48103. The finding may be based on the notifications that the Secretary receives under section 47105(f) or on other information received from airport sponsors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Restoration of apportionments.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the fiscal year for which a finding is made under paragraph (1) with respect to an apportionment is not the last fiscal year of availability of the apportionment under subsection (b), the Secretary shall restore to the apportionment an amount equal to the amount of the apportionment used under paragraph (1) for a discretionary grant whenever a sufficient amount is made available under section 48103.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Period of availability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If restoration under this paragraph is made in the fiscal year for which the finding is made or the succeeding fiscal year, the amount restored shall be subject to the original period of availability of the apportionment under subsection (b). If the restoration is made thereafter, the amount restored shall remain available in accordance with subsection (b) for the original period of availability of the apportionment plus the number of fiscal years during which a sufficient amount was not available for the restoration.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:991 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Newly available amounts.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Restored amounts to be unavailable for discretionary grants</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Of an amount newly available under section 48103 of this title, an amount equal to the amounts restored under paragraph (2) shall not be available for discretionary grant obligations under section 47115.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Use of remaining amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subparagraph (A) does not impair the Secretary's authority under paragraph (1), after a restoration under paragraph (2), to apply all or part of a restored amount that is not required to fund a grant under an apportionment to fund discretionary grants.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Limitations on obligations apply</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the Secretary to incur grant obligations under section 47104 for a fiscal year in an amount greater than the amount made available under section 48103 for such obligations for such fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Limiting Authority of Secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The authority of the Secretary to make grants during a fiscal year from amounts that were apportioned for a prior fiscal year and remain available for approved airport development project grants under subsection (b) of this section may be impaired only by a law enacted after September 3, 1982, that expressly limits that authority.</p>
