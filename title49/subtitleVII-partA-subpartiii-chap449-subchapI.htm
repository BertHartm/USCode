<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Under Secretary of Transportation for Security shall provide for the screening of all passengers and property, including United States mail, cargo, carry-on and checked baggage, and other articles, that will be carried aboard a passenger aircraft operated by an air carrier or foreign air carrier in air transportation or intrastate air transportation. In the case of flights and flight segments originating in the United States, the screening shall take place before boarding and shall be carried out by a Federal Government employee (as defined in section 2105 of title 5, United States Code), except as otherwise provided in section 44919 or 44920 and except for identifying passengers and baggage for screening under the CAPPS and known shipper programs and conducting positive bag-match programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Supervision of Screening</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;All screening of passengers and property at airports in the United States where screening is required under this section shall be supervised by uniformed Federal personnel of the Transportation Security Administration who shall have the power to order the dismissal of any individual performing such screening.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Checked Baggage</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A system must be in operation to screen all checked baggage at all airports in the United States as soon as practicable but not later than the 60th day following the date of enactment of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Explosive Detection Systems.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Under Secretary of Transportation for Security shall take all necessary action to ensure that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) all systems deployed under subparagraph (A) are fully utilized; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if explosive detection equipment at an airport is unavailable, all checked baggage is screened by an alternative means.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Deadline.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, in his discretion or at the request of an airport, the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security determines that the Transportation Security Administration is not able to deploy explosive detection systems required to be deployed <!-- PDFPage:857 -->under paragraph (1) at all airports where explosive detection systems are required by December 31, 2002, then with respect to each airport for which the Under Secretary makes that determination&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the Under Secretary shall submit to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure a detailed plan (which may be submitted in classified form) for the deployment of the number of explosive detection systems at that airport necessary to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) as soon as practicable at that airport but in no event later than December 31, 2003; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Under Secretary shall take all necessary action to ensure that alternative means of screening all checked baggage is implemented until the requirements of paragraph (1) have been met.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Criteria for determination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In making a determination under subparagraph (A), the Under Secretary shall take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the nature and extent of the required modifications to the airport's terminal buildings, and the technical, engineering, design and construction issues;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the need to ensure that such installations and modifications are effective; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of deploying explosive detection systems in the baggage sorting area or other non-public area rather than the lobby of an airport terminal building.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Response</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Under Secretary shall respond to the request of an airport under subparagraph (A) within 14 days of receiving the request. A denial of request shall create no right of appeal or judicial review.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Deployment and Purchase of Equipment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A deployment or purchase of explosive detection equipment under section 108.7(b)(8) or 108.20 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, or similar regulation is required only if the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security certifies that the equipment alone, or as part of an integrated system, can detect under realistic air carrier operating conditions the amounts, configurations, and types of explosive material that would likely be used to cause catastrophic damage to commercial aircraft. The Under Secretary shall base the certification on the results of tests conducted under protocols developed in consultation with expert scientists outside of the Transportation Security Administration. Those tests shall be completed not later than April 16, 1992.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before completion of the tests described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, but not later than April 16, 1992, the Under Secretary may require deployment of explosive detection equipment described in paragraph (1) if the Under Secretary decides that deployment will enhance aviation security significantly. In making that decision, the Under Secretary shall consider factors such as the ability of the equipment alone, or as part of an integrated system, to detect under realistic air carrier operating conditions the amounts, configurations, and types of explosive material that would likely be used to cause catastrophic damage to commercial aircraft. The Under Secretary shall notify the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives of a deployment decision made under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Until such time as the Under Secretary determines that equipment certified under paragraph (1) is commercially available and has successfully completed operational testing as provided in paragraph (1), the Under Secretary shall facilitate the deployment of such approved commercially available explosive detection devices as the Under Secretary determines will enhance aviation security significantly. The Under Secretary shall require that equipment deployed under this paragraph be replaced by equipment certified under paragraph (1) when equipment certified under paragraph (1) becomes commercially available. The Under Secretary is authorized, based on operational considerations at individual airports, to waive the required installation of commercially available equipment under paragraph (1) in the interests of aviation security. The Under Secretary may permit the requirements of this paragraph to be met at airports by the deployment of dogs or other appropriate animals to supplement equipment for screening passengers, baggage, mail, or cargo for explosives or weapons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This subsection does not prohibit the Under Secretary from purchasing or deploying explosive detection equipment described in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
