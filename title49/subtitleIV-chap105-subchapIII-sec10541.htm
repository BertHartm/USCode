<p class="statutory-body">(a) Subject to this chapter and other law, the Interstate Commerce Commission has jurisdiction over transportation insofar as water carriers are concerned&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by water carrier between a place in a State and a place in another State, even if part of the transportation is outside the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by water carrier and rail carrier or motor carrier from a place in a State to a place in another State, except that if part of the transportation is outside the United States, the Commission only has jurisdiction over that part of the transportation provided&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by rail carrier or motor carrier that is in the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by water carrier that is from a place in the United States to another place in the United States; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) by water carrier or by water carrier and rail carrier or motor carrier between a place in the United States and a place outside the United States, to the extent that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) when the transportation is by rail carrier or motor carrier, the transportation is provided in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) when the transportation is by water carrier to a place outside the United States, the transportation is provided by water carrier from a place in the United States to another place in the United States before transshipment from a place in the United States to a place outside the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) when the transportation is by water carrier from a place outside the United States, the transportation is provided by water carrier from a place in the United States to another place in the United States after transshipment to a place in the United States from a place outside the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If transportation by a carrier would be subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under both subsection (a) of this section and subchapter I of this chapter, then that transportation is subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subsection (a) of this section. However, that transportation is also subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I of this chapter to the extent that this subtitle imposes requirements on transportation by carriers subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I that are not imposed on transportation by carriers subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) This subtitle does not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) affect the power of a State to regulate intrastate transportation provided by a water carrier; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) authorize the Commission to prescribe or regulate a rate for intrastate transportation by a water carrier.</p>

<p class="note-body">In the introductory matter of subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;the Interstate Commerce Commission has jurisdiction over transportation insofar as water carriers are concerned&rdquo; are based on 49:chapter 12 and are inserted to inform the reader of the general jurisdiction of the Commission in the water carrier area and to conform to the approach of sections 10501 and 10521 that are based on existing law. The words &ldquo;Subject to this chapter and other provisions of law&rdquo; are inserted to inform the reader that other sections of the subtitle qualify the grant of jurisdiction to the Commission under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1), (3), the words &ldquo;wholly&rdquo;, and &ldquo;partly&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;water carrier&rdquo;, &ldquo;rail carrier&rdquo;, and &ldquo;motor carrier&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;water&rdquo;, &ldquo;railroad&rdquo;, and &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo;, respectively, as more precise because the purpose of the language of the section is to state the jurisdiction of the Commission over transportation by the 3 types of carriers, and the terms &ldquo;railroad&rdquo; and &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo; are defined terms incorporated into the definitions of &ldquo;rail carrier&rdquo; and &ldquo;motor carrier&rdquo;, respectively.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(3), the words &ldquo;for movement&rdquo; and &ldquo;in a movement&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;This subtitle does not&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Nothing in this chapter shall&rdquo; for clarity. The word &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;intrastate transportation&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;intrastate commerce&rdquo; for consistency. The words &ldquo;within the jurisdiction of such State&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. The word &ldquo;rate&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;rate, fare, or charge&rdquo; because of the definition of &ldquo;rate&rdquo; in section 10102 of the revised title. The words after &ldquo;intrastate transportation&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because services are included in the word &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; and because of the restatement of the source provisions.</p>
