<p class="statutory-body">(a) The authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission to act under this subchapter is exclusive. The Commission may approve and authorize a carrier, as defined in section 11301(a)(1) of this title, to change (1) a part of a class of its securities, as defined in section 11301(a)(2) of this title, or (2) a part of an instrument under which a class of its securities is issued or a class of its obligations is secured. When a change is approved and authorized by the Commission under this subchapter, the carrier may carry out the change notwithstanding an express provision in the affected instrument or a State law and without getting other approval from the Commission or from a State authority. A person participating in carrying out a change that is approved and authorized under this subchapter is exempt from all other law, including State and municipal law, as necessary to let that person carry out the change.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission may not approve an application filed under this section by a carrier that is in equity receivership or reorganization under subchapter IV of chapter 11 of title 11.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A power granted to a carrier under this subchapter changes its powers under its corporate charter and under State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) This subchapter does not affect the negotiability of a security of a carrier or of the obligation of a carrier that assumed liability related to a security. This subchapter does not apply to an equipment-trust certificate under which a carrier is obligated, to an evidence of indebtedness of a carrier the payment of which is secured solely by equipment, or to another instrument under which that equipment-trust certificate or evidence of indebtedness was issued or by which either of them is secured.</p>
