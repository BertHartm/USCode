The Secretary shall decide what increase in construction costs has occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Availability of Information, Patents, and Developments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the United States Government makes more than a minimal contribution to a research or development activity under this chapter, the Secretary shall include in the arrangement for the activity a provision to ensure that all information, patents, and developments related to the activity are available to the public. However, the owner of a background patent may not be deprived of a right under the patent.</p>
