<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;upon application&rdquo; and &ldquo;grant of such&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;give the public an opportunity to inspect&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;afford access to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. public&rdquo; for clarity.

Clauses (A) and (B) restate the exceptions provided by section 201 of that Act and by section 4417a of the Revised Statutes as subsequently amended. Clause (C) is substituted for &ldquo;any other vessel regulated under such Act, to the extent of such regulation&rdquo; because of the restatement.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(2), before clause (A), the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;issued&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code.</p>
