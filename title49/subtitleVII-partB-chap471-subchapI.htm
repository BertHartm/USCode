<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the safe operation of the airport and airway system is the highest aviation priority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that aviation facilities be constructed and operated to minimize current and projected noise impact on nearby communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to give special emphasis to developing reliever airports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that appropriate provisions should be made to make the development and enhancement of cargo hub airports easier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to encourage the development of transportation systems that use various modes of transportation in a way that will serve the States and local communities efficiently and effectively;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) that airport development projects under this subchapter provide for the protection and enhancement of natural resources and the quality of the environment of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) that airport construction and improvement projects that increase the capacity of facilities to accommodate passenger and cargo traffic be undertaken to the maximum feasible extent so that safety and efficiency increase and delays decrease;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) to ensure that nonaviation usage of the navigable airspace be accommodated but not allowed to decrease the safety and capacity of the airspace and airport system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) that artificial restrictions on airport capacity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are not in the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) should be imposed to alleviate air traffic delays only after other reasonably available and less burdensome alternatives have been tried; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) should not discriminate unjustly between categories and classes of aircraft;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) that special emphasis should be placed on converting appropriate former military air bases to civil use and identifying and improving additional joint-use facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) that the airport improvement program should be administered to encourage projects that employ innovative technology, concepts, and approaches that will promote safety, capacity, and efficiency improvements in the construction of airports and in the air transportation system (including the development and use of innovative concrete and other materials in the construction of airport facilities to minimize initial laydown costs, minimize time out of service, and maximize lifecycle durability) and to encourage and solicit innovative technology proposals and activities in the expenditure of funding pursuant to this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) that airport fees, rates, and charges must be reasonable and may only be used for purposes not prohibited by this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) that airports should be as self-sustaining as possible under the circumstances existing at each particular airport and in establishing new fees, rates, and charges, and generating revenues from all sources, airport owners and operators should not seek to create revenue surpluses that exceed the amounts to be used for airport system purposes and for other purposes for which airport revenues may be spent <!-- PDFPage:655 -->under section 47107(b)(1) of this title, including reasonable reserves and other funds to facilitate financing and cover contingencies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>National Transportation Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) It is a goal of the United States to develop a national intermodal transportation system that transports passengers and property in an efficient manner. The future economic direction of the United States depends on its ability to confront directly the enormous challenges of the global economy, declining productivity growth, energy vulnerability, air pollution, and the need to rebuild the infrastructure of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) United States leadership in the world economy, the expanding wealth of the United States, the competitiveness of the industry of the United States, the standard of living, and the quality of life are at stake.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A national intermodal transportation system is a coordinated, flexible network of diverse but complementary forms of transportation that transports passengers and property in the most efficient manner. By reducing transportation costs, these intermodal systems will enhance the ability of the industry of the United States to compete in the global marketplace.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) All forms of transportation, including aviation and other transportation systems of the future, will be full partners in the effort to reduce energy consumption and air pollution while promoting economic development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) An intermodal transportation system consists of transportation hubs that connect different forms of appropriate transportation and provides users with the most efficient means of transportation and with access to commercial centers, business locations, population centers, and the vast rural areas of the United States, as well as providing links to other forms of transportation and to intercity connections.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Intermodality and flexibility are paramount issues in the process of developing an integrated system that will obtain the optimum yield of United States resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The United States transportation infrastructure must be reshaped to provide the economic underpinnings for the United States to compete in the 21st century global economy. The United States can no longer rely on the sheer size of its economy to dominate international economic rivals and must recognize fully that its economy is no longer a separate entity but is part of the global marketplace. The future economic prosperity of the United States depends on its ability to compete in an international marketplace that is teeming with competitors but in which a full one-quarter of the economic activity of the United States takes place.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The United States must make a national commitment to rebuild its infrastructure through development of a national intermodal transportation system. The United States must provide the foundation for its industries to improve productivity and their ability to compete in the global economy with a system that will transport passengers and property in an efficient manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Capacity Expansion and Noise Abatement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is in the public interest to recognize the effects of airport capacity expansion projects on aircraft noise. Efforts to increase capacity through any means can have an impact on surrounding communities. Noncompatible land uses around airports must be reduced and efforts to mitigate noise must be given a high priority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Consistency With Air Commerce and Safety Policies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each airport and airway program should be carried out consistently with section 40101(a), (b), (d), and (f) of this title to foster competition, prevent unfair methods of competition in air transportation, maintain essential air transportation, and prevent unjust and discriminatory practices, including as the practices may be applied between categories and classes of aircraft.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Adequacy of Navigation Aids and Airport Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subchapter should be carried out to provide adequate navigation aids and airport facilities for places at which scheduled commercial air service is provided. The facilities provided may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) reliever airports; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) heliports designated by the Secretary of Transportation to relieve congestion at commercial service airports by diverting aircraft passengers from fixed-wing aircraft to helicopter carriers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Use of Safety Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subchapter should be carried out consistently with a comprehensive airspace system plan, giving highest priority to commercial service airports, to maximize the use of safety facilities, including installing, operating, and maintaining, to the extent possible with available money and considering other safety needs&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) electronic or visual vertical guidance on each runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) grooving or friction treatment of each primary and secondary runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) distance-to-go signs for each primary and secondary runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a precision approach system, a vertical visual guidance system, and a full approach light system for each primary runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a nonprecision instrument approach for each secondary runway;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) runway end identifier lights on each runway that does not have an approach light system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) a surface movement radar system at each category III airport;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) a taxiway lighting and sign system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) runway edge lighting and marking; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) radar approach coverage for each airport terminal area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Cooperation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To carry out the policy of subsection (a)(5) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall cooperate with State and local officials in developing airport plans and programs that are based on overall transportation needs. The airport plans and programs shall be developed in coordination with other transportation planning and considering comprehensive long-range land-use plans and overall social, economic, environmental, system performance, and energy conservation objectives. The process of developing airport plans and programs shall be continuing, cooperative, and <!-- PDFPage:656 -->comprehensive to the degree appropriate to the complexity of the transportation problems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Consultation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To carry out the policy of subsection (a)(6) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall consult with the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency about any project included in a project grant application involving the location of an airport or runway, or a major runway extension, that may have a significant effect on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) natural resources, including fish and wildlife;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) natural, scenic, and recreation assets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) water and air quality; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) another factor affecting the environment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the sponsor of each airport gives written consent that the State be the applicant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the Secretary is satisfied there is administrative merit and aeronautical benefit in the State being the sponsor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) an acceptable agreement exists that ensures that the State will comply with appropriate grant conditions and other assurances the Secretary requires.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before deciding to undertake an airport development project at an airport under this subchapter, a sponsor shall consult with the airport users that will be affected by the project.</p>

However, the revenue resulting during a Hawaiian fiscal year may be used only if the amount of the revenue, plus amounts Hawaii receives in the fiscal year from all other sources for costs Hawaii incurs for operating all airports it operates and for debt service related to capital projects for the airports (including interest and amortization of principal costs), is more than 150 percent of the projected costs for the fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Revenue from sales referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection in a Hawaiian fiscal year that Hawaii may use may not be more than the amount that is greater than 150 percent as determined under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The maximum amount of revenue Hawaii may use under paragraph (2) of this subsection is $250,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If a fee imposed or collected for rent, landing, or service from an aircraft operator by an airport operated by Hawaii is increased during the period from May 4, 1990, through December 31, 1994, by more than the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index of All Urban Consum<!-- PDFPage:668 -->ers for Honolulu, Hawaii, that the Secretary of Labor publishes during that period and if revenue derived from the fee increases because the fee increased, the amount under paragraph (3)(B) of this subsection shall be reduced by the amount of the projected revenue increase in the period less the part of the increase attributable to changes in the Index in the period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Hawaii shall determine costs, revenue, and projected revenue increases referred to in this subsection and shall submit the determinations to the Secretary of Transportation. A determination is approved unless the Secretary disapproves it not later than 30 days after it is submitted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Hawaii is not eligible for a grant under section 47115 of this title in a fiscal year in which Hawaii uses under paragraph (2) of this subsection revenue from sales referred to in paragraph (2). Hawaii shall repay amounts it receives in a fiscal year under a grant it is not eligible to receive because of this paragraph to the Secretary of Transportation for deposit in the discretionary fund established under section 47115.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) This subsection applies only to revenue from sales referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection from May 5, 1990, through December 30, 1994, and to amounts in the Airport Revenue Fund of Hawaii that are attributable to revenue before May 4, 1990, on sales referred to in paragraph (2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this subsection, the Secretary of Transportation shall establish policies and procedures that will assure the prompt and effective enforcement of subsections (a)(13) and (b) of this section and grant assurances made under such subsections. Such policies and procedures shall recognize the exemption provision in subsection (b)(2) of this section and shall respond to the information contained in the reports of the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation on airport revenue diversion and such other relevant information as the Secretary may by law consider.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Revenue diversion</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Policies and procedures to be established pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection shall prohibit, at a minimum, the diversion of airport revenues (except as authorized under subsection (b) of this section) through&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Administrative safeguards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Policies and procedures to be established pursuant to paragraph (1) shall mandate internal controls, auditing requirements, and increased levels of Department of Transportation personnel sufficient to respond fully and promptly to complaints received regarding possible violations of subsections (a)(13) and (b) of this section and grant assurances made under such subsections and to alert the Secretary to such possible violations.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in section 47111 of this title, the United States Government may pay or be obligated to pay, from amounts appropriated to carry out this subchapter, a cost incurred in carrying out a project under this subchapter only if the Secretary of Transportation decides the cost is allowable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Allowable Cost Standards</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A project cost is allowable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if the cost necessarily is incurred in carrying out the project in compliance with the grant agreement made for the project under this subchapter, including any cost a sponsor incurs related to an audit the Secretary requires under section 47121(b) or (d) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) if the cost is incurred after the grant agreement is executed and is for airport development or airport planning carried out after the grant agreement is executed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the cost is incurred after June 1, 1989, by the airport operator (regardless of when the grant agreement is executed) as part of a Government-approved noise compatability program (including project formulation costs) and is consistent with all applicable statutory and administrative requirements; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) if the Government's share is paid only with amounts apportioned under section 47114(c)(1)(A) and (2) of this title and if the cost is incurred&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) during the fiscal year ending September 30, 1994;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) before a grant agreement is executed for the project but according to an airport layout plan the Secretary approves before the cost is incurred and all applicable statutory and administrative requirements that would apply to the project if the agreement had been executed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) for work related to a project for which a grant agreement previously was executed during the fiscal year ending September 30, 1994;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to the extent the cost is reasonable in amount;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) if the cost is not incurred in a project for airport development or airport planning for which other Government assistance has been granted; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) if the total costs allowed for the project are not more than the amount stated in the grant agreement as the maximum the Government will pay (except as provided in section 47108(b) of this title).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Certain Prior Costs as Allowable Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may decide that a project cost under subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section incurred after May 13, 1946, and before the date the grant agreement is executed is allowable if it is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) necessarily incurred in formulating an airport development project, including costs incurred for field surveys, plans and specifications, property interests in land or airspace, and administration or other incidental items that would not have been incurred except for the project; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) necessarily and directly incurred in developing the work scope of an airport planning project.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Terminal Development Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may decide that the cost of terminal development (including multi-modal terminal development) in a nonrevenue-producing public-use area of a commercial service airport is allowable for an airport development project at the airport&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if the sponsor certifies that the airport, on the date the grant application is submitted to the Secretary, has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) all the safety equipment required for certification of the airport under section 44706 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) all the security equipment required by regulation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) provided for access, to the area of the airport for passengers for boarding or exiting aircraft, to those passengers boarding or exiting aircraft, except air carrier aircraft;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the cost is directly related to moving passengers and baggage in air commerce within the airport, including vehicles for moving passengers between terminal facilities and between terminal facilities and aircraft; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) under terms necessary to protect the interests of the Government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In making a decision under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary may approve as allowable costs the expenses of terminal development in a revenue-producing area and construction, reconstruction, repair, and improvement in a nonrevenue-producing parking lot if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the airport does not have more than .05 percent of the total annual passenger boardings in the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the sponsor certifies that any needed airport development project affecting safety, security, or capacity will not be deferred because of the Secretary's approval.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Letters of Intent</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may issue a letter of intent to the sponsor stating an intention to obligate from future budget authority an amount, not more than the Government's share of allowable project costs, for <!-- PDFPage:674 -->an airport development project (including costs of formulating the project) at a primary or reliever airport. The letter shall establish a schedule under which the Secretary will reimburse the sponsor for the Government's share of allowable project costs, as amounts become available, if the sponsor, after the Secretary issues the letter, carries out the project without receiving amounts under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection applies to a project&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) about which the sponsor notifies the Secretary, before the project begins, of the sponsor's intent to carry out the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that will comply with all statutory and administrative requirements that would apply to the project if it were carried out with amounts made available under this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary decides will enhance system-wide airport capacity significantly and meets the criteria of section 47115(d) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A letter of intent issued under paragraph (1) of this subsection is not an obligation of the Government under section 1501 of title 31, and the letter is not deemed to be an administrative commitment for financing. An obligation or administrative commitment may be made only as amounts are provided in authorization and appropriation laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The total estimated amount of future Government obligations covered by all outstanding letters of intent under paragraph (1) of this subsection may not be more than the amount authorized to carry out section 48103 of this title, less an amount reasonably estimated by the Secretary to be needed for grants under section 48103 that are not covered by a letter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A letter of intent issued under paragraph (1) of this subsection may not condition the obligation of amounts on the imposition of a passenger facility fee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on statutory construction</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the obligation of amounts pursuant to a letter of intent under this subsection in the same fiscal year as the letter of intent is issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Nonallowable Costs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section and section 47118(f) of this title, a cost is not an allowable airport development project cost if it is for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) constructing a public parking facility for passenger automobiles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) constructing, altering, or repairing part of an airport building, except to the extent the building will be used for facilities or activities directly related to the safety of individuals at the airport;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After making a project grant agreement under this subchapter and consulting with the sponsor, the Secretary of Transportation may decide when and in what amounts payments under the agreement will be made. Payments totaling not more than 90 percent of the United States Government's share of the project's estimated allowable costs may be made before the project is completed if the sponsor certifies to the Secretary that the total amount expended from the advance payments at any time will not be more than the cost of the airport development work completed on the project at that time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Recovering Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary determines that the total amount of payments made under a grant agreement under this subchapter is more than the Government's share of the total allowable project costs, the Government may recover the excess amount. If the Secretary finds that a project for which an advance payment was made has not been completed within a reasonable time, the Government may recover any part of the advance payment for which the Government received no benefit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Payment Deposits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A payment under a project grant agreement under this subchapter may be made only to an official or depository designated by the sponsor and authorized by law to receive public money.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Withholding Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may withhold a payment under a grant agreement under this subchapter for more than 180 days after the payment is due only if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notifies the sponsor and provides an opportunity for a hearing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) finds that the sponsor has violated the agreement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The 180-day period may be extended by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) agreement of the Secretary and the sponsor; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the hearing officer if the officer decides an extension is necessary because the sponsor did not follow the schedule the officer established.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A person adversely affected by an order of the Secretary withholding a payment may apply <!-- PDFPage:676 -->for review of the order by filing a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which the project is located. The petition must be filed not later than 60 days after the order is served on the petitioner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Action on Grant Assurances Concerning Airport Revenues</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the Secretary finds a violation of section 47107(b) of this title, as further defined by the Secretary under section 47107(<em>l</em>) of this title, or a violation of an assurance made under section 47107(b) of this title, and the Secretary has provided an opportunity for the airport sponsor to take corrective action to cure such violation, and such corrective action has not been taken within the period of time set by the Secretary, the Secretary shall withhold approval of any new grant application for funds under this chapter, or any proposed modification to an existing grant that would increase the amount of funds made available under this chapter to the airport sponsor, and withhold approval of any new application to impose a fee under section 40117 of this title. Such applications may thereafter be approved only upon a finding by the Secretary that such corrective action as the Secretary requires has been taken to address the violation and that the violation no longer exists.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Judicial Enforcement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For any violation of this chapter or any grant assurance made under this chapter, the Secretary may apply to the district court of the United States for any district in which the violation occurred for enforcement. Such court shall have jurisdiction to enforce obedience thereto by a writ of injunction or other process, mandatory or otherwise, restraining any person from further violation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Apportionment Date</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On the first day of each fiscal year, the Secretary of Transportation shall apportion the amount subject to apportionment for that fiscal year as provided in this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:678 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Amounts Apportioned to Sponsors</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1)(A) The Secretary shall apportion to the sponsor of each primary airport for each fiscal year an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) $7.80 for each of the first 50,000 passenger boardings at the airport during the prior calendar year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) $5.20 for each of the next 50,000 passenger boardings at the airport during the prior calendar year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) $2.60 for each of the next 400,000 passenger boardings at the airport during the prior calendar year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) $.65 for each additional passenger boarding at the airport during the prior calendar year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not less than $500,000 nor more than $22,000,000 may be apportioned under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph to an airport sponsor for a primary airport for each fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary shall apportion to the sponsors of airports served by aircraft providing air transportation of only cargo with a total annual landed weight of more than 100,000,000 pounds for each fiscal year an amount equal to 3.5 percent of the amount subject to apportionment each year, allocated among those airports in the proportion that the total annual landed weight of those aircraft landing at each of those airports bears to the total annual landed weight of those aircraft landing at all those airports. However, not more than 8 percent of the amount apportioned under this paragraph may be apportioned for any one airport.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Landed weight under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph is the landed weight of aircraft landing at each of those airports and all those airports during the prior calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the total of all amounts apportioned under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection may not be more than 49.5 percent of the amount subject to apportionment for a fiscal year.

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If a law limits the amount subject to apportionment to less than $1,900,000,000 for a fiscal year, the total of all amounts apportioned under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection may not be more than 44 percent of the amount subject to apportionment for that fiscal year. If this subparagraph requires reduction of an amount that otherwise would be apportioned under this subsection, the Secretary shall reduce proportionately the amount apportioned to each sponsor of an airport under paragraphs (1) and (2) until the 44 percent limit is achieved.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, 49.5 percent of the apportioned amount for airports, except primary airports and airports described in section 47117(e)(1)(C) of this title, in States not named in clause (A) of this paragraph in the proportion that the area of each of those States bears to the total area of all of those States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An amount apportioned under paragraph (2) of this subsection for an airport in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Alaska may be made available by the Secretary for a public airport described in section 47117(e)(1)(C)(ii) of this title to which section 15(a)(3)(A)(II) of the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970 applied during the fiscal year that ended September 30, 1981; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Puerto Rico may be made available by the Secretary for a primary airport and an airport described in section 47117(e)(1)(C) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Alternative Apportionment for Alaska</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Instead of apportioning amounts for airports in Alaska under subsections (c) and (d) of this section, the Secretary may apportion amounts for those airports in the way in which amounts were apportioned in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, under section 15(a) of the Act. However, in apportioning amounts for a fiscal year under this subsection, the Secretary shall apportion&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for each primary airport at least as much as would be apportioned for the airport under subsection (c)(1) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a total amount at least equal to the minimum amount required to be apportioned to airports in Alaska in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, under section 15(a)(3)(A) of the Act.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This subsection does not prohibit the Secretary from making project grants for airports in Alaska from the discretionary fund under section 47115 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Airports referred to in this subsection include those public airports that received scheduled service as of September 3, 1982, but were not apportioned amounts in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, under section 15(a) of the Act because the airports were not under the control of a State or local public agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Reducing Apportionments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An amount that would be apportioned under this section (except subsection (c)(2)) in a fiscal year to the sponsor of an airport having at least .25 percent of the total number of boardings each year in the United States and for which a fee is imposed in the fiscal year under section 40117 of this title shall be reduced by an amount equal to 50 percent of the projected revenues from the fee in <!-- PDFPage:679 -->the fiscal year but not by more than 50 percent of the amount that otherwise would be apportioned under this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;47115. Discretionary fund</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Existence and Amounts in Fund</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation has a discretionary fund. The fund consists of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) amounts subject to apportionment for a fiscal year that are not apportioned under section 47114(c)&ndash;(e) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 25 percent of amounts not apportioned under section 47114 of this title because of section 47114(f).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Availability of Amounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to subsection (c) of this section and section 47117(e) of this title, the fund is available for making grants for any purpose for which amounts are made available under section 48103 of this title that the Secretary considers most appropriate to carry out this subchapter. However, 50 percent of amounts not apportioned under section 47114 of this title because of section 47114(f) and added to the fund is available for making grants for projects at small hub airports (as defined in section 41731 of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Minimum Percentage for Primary and Reliever Airports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At least 75 percent of the amount in the fund and distributed by the Secretary in a fiscal year shall be used for making grants&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to preserve and enhance capacity, safety, and security at primary and reliever airports; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to carry out airport noise compatibility planning and programs at primary and reliever airports.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In selecting a project for a grant to preserve and enhance capacity as described in subsection (c)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the effect the project will have on the overall national air transportation system capacity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the project benefit and cost; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the financial commitment from non-United States Government sources to preserve or enhance airport capacity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Waiving Percentage Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary decides the Secretary cannot comply with the percentage requirement of subsection (c) of this section in a fiscal year because there are insufficient qualified grant applications to meet that percentage, the amount the Secretary determines will not be distributed as required by subsection (c) is available for obligation during the fiscal year without regard to the requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Consideration of Diversion of Revenues in Awarding Discretionary Grants.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>General rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to paragraph (2), in deciding whether or not to distribute funds to an airport from the discretionary funds established by subsection (a) of this section and section 47116 of this title, the Secretary shall consider as a factor militating against the distribution of such funds to the airport the fact that the airport is using revenues generated by the airport or by local taxes on aviation fuel for purposes other than capital or operating costs of the airport or the local airports system or other local facilities which are owned or operated by the owner or operator of the airport and directly and substantially related to the actual air transportation of passengers or property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Required finding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Paragraph (1) shall apply only when the Secretary finds that the amount of revenues used by the airport for purposes other than capital or operating costs in the airport's fiscal year preceding the date of the application for discretionary funds exceeds the amount of such revenues in the airport's first fiscal year ending after the date of the enactment of this subsection, adjusted by the Secretary for changes in the Consumer Price Index of All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#47115_1_target" name="47115_1">1</a></sup> <cap-smallcap>Minimum Amount To Be Credited</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In a fiscal year, at least $325,000,000 of the amount made available under section 48103 of this title shall be credited to the fund. The amount credited is exclusive of amounts that have been apportioned in a prior fiscal year under section 47114 of this title and that remain available for obligation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In a fiscal year in which the amount credited under subsection (a) of this section is less than $325,000,000, the total amount calculated under paragraph (3) of this subsection shall be reduced by an amount that, when credited to the fund, together with the amount credited under subsection (a), equals $325,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For a fiscal year, the total amount available to reduce to carry out paragraph (2) of this subsection is the total of the amounts determined under sections 47114(c)(1)(A) and (2) and (d) and 47117(e) of this title. Each amount shall be reduced by an equal percentage to achieve the reduction.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall designate not more than 15 current or former military airports for which grants may be made under section 47117(e)(1)(E) of this title. The Secretary may only designate an airport for such grants (other than an airport designated for such grants on or before the date of the enactment of this sentence) if the Secretary finds that grants under such section for projects at such airport would reduce delays at an airport with more than 20,000 hours of annual delays in commercial passenger aircraft takeoffs and landings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Survey</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than September 30, 1991, the Secretary shall complete a survey of current and former military airports to identify which airports have the greatest potential to improve the capacity of the national air transportation system. The survey shall identify the capital development needs of those airports to make them part of the system and which of those qualify for grants under section 47104 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall consider only current or former military airports that, when at least partly converted to civilian commercial or reliever airports as part of the national air transportation system, will enhance airport and air traffic control system capacity in major metropolitan areas and reduce current and projected flight delays.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Grants</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Grants under section 47117(e)(1)(E) of this title may be made for an airport designated under subsection (a) of this section for the 5 fiscal years following the designation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Terminal Building Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding section 47109(c)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#47118_1_target" name="47118_1">1</a></sup> of this title, not more than $5,000,000 for each airport from amounts the Secretary distributes under section 47115 of this title for a fiscal year is available to the sponsor of a current or former military airport the Secretary designates under this section to construct, improve, or repair a terminal building facility, including terminal gates used for revenue passengers getting on or off aircraft. A gate constructed, improved, or repaired under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may not be leased for more than 10 years; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is not subject to majority in interest clauses.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Parking Lots, Fuel Farms, and Utilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not more than a total of $4,000,000 for each airport from amounts the Secretary distributes under section 47115 of this title for the fiscal years ending September 30, 1993&ndash;1996, is available to the sponsor of a current or former military airport the Secretary designates under <!-- PDFPage:684 -->this section to construct, improve, or repair airport surface parking lots, fuel farms, and utilities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall issue a determination as to whether a fee imposed upon one or more air carriers (as defined in section 40102 of this subtitle) by the owner or operator of an airport is reasonable if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a written request for such determination is filed with the Secretary by such owner or operator; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a written complaint requesting such determination is filed with the Secretary by an affected air carrier within 60 days after such carrier receives written notice of the establishment or increase of such fee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Calculation of fee</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A fee subject to a determination of reasonableness under this section may be calculated pursuant to either a compensatory or residual fee methodology or any combination thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Secretary not to set fee</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining whether a fee is reasonable under this section, the Secretary may only determine whether the fee is reasonable or unreasonable and shall not set the level of the fee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Procedural Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this section, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register final regulations, policy statements, or guidelines establishing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the procedures for acting upon any written request or complaint filed under subsection (a)(1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the standards or guidelines that shall be used by the Secretary in determining under this section whether an airport fee is reasonable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Decisions By Secretary</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The final regulations, policy statements, or guidelines required in subsection (b) shall provide the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Not more than 120 days after an air carrier files with the Secretary a written complaint relating to an airport fee, the Secretary shall issue a final order determining whether such fee is reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Within 30 days after such complaint is filed with the Secretary, the Secretary shall dismiss the complaint if no significant dispute exists or shall assign the matter to an administrative law judge; and thereafter the matter shall be handled in accordance with part 302 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, or as modified by the Secretary to ensure an orderly disposition of the matter within the 120-day period and any specifically applicable provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The administrative law judge shall issue a recommended decision within 60 days after the complaint is assigned or within such shorter period as the Secretary may specify.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If the Secretary, upon the expiration of 120 days after the filing of the complaint, has not issued a final order, the decision of the administrative law judge shall be deemed to be the final order of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Any party to the dispute may seek review of a final order of the Secretary under this subsection in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or the court of appeals in the circuit where the airport which gives rise to the written complaint is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Any findings of fact in a final order of the Secretary under this subsection, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive if challenged in a court pursuant to this subsection. No objection to such a final order shall be considered by the court unless objection was urged before an administrative law judge or the Secretary at a proceeding under this subsection or, if not so urged, unless there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Payment Under Protest; Guarantee of Air Carrier Access.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Payment under protest.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any fee increase or newly established fee which is the subject of a complaint that is not dismissed by the Secretary shall be paid by the complainant air carrier to the airport under protest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Referral or credit</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any amounts paid under this subsection by a complainant air carrier to the airport under protest shall be subject to refund or credit to the air car<!-- PDFPage:690 -->rier in accordance with directions in the final order of the Secretary within 30 days of such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Assurance of timely repayment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In order to assure the timely repayment, with interest, of amounts in dispute determined not to be reasonable by the Secretary, the airport shall obtain a letter of credit, or surety bond, or other suitable credit facility, equal to the amount in dispute that is due during the 120-day period established by this section, plus interest, unless the airport and the complainant air carrier agree otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Deadline</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The letter of credit, or surety bond, or other suitable credit facility shall be provided to the Secretary within 20 days of the filing of the complaint and shall remain in effect for 30 days after the earlier of 120 days or the issuance of a timely final order by the Secretary determining whether such fee is reasonable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Guarantee of air carrier access</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Contingent upon an air carrier's compliance with the requirements of paragraph (1) and pending the issuance of a final order by the Secretary determining the reasonableness of a fee that is the subject of a complaint filed under subsection (a)(1)(B), an owner or operator of an airport may not deny an air carrier currently providing air service at the airport reasonable access to airport facilities or service, or otherwise interfere with an air carrier's prices, routes, or services, as a means of enforcing the fee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Applicability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This section does not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a fee imposed pursuant to a written agreement with air carriers using the facilities of an airport;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any other existing fee not in dispute as of such date of enactment.</p>
