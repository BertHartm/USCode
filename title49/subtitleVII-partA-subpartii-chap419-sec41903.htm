<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words &ldquo;Subject to subsection (b) of this section&rdquo; are added for clarity because subsection (b) limits the effect of this section. The words &ldquo;transport mail by aircraft in foreign air transportation or between places in Alaska&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the transportation of mail&rdquo; in 49 App.:1371(<em>l</em>) and &ldquo;the transportation of mail by aircraft&rdquo; in 49 App.:1375(d) because 49 App.:1551(a)(4)(A) provides that 49 App.:1371(<em>l</em>) and 1375(d) no longer apply to interstate or overseas air transportation (except transportation of mail between 2 places in Alaska). Clause (2) is substituted for &ldquo;shall transport mail whenever required by the United States Postal Service&rdquo; in 49 App.:1371(<em>l</em>) and the text of 49 App.:1375(d) for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. The text of 49 App.:1371(<em>l</em>) (last sentence) is omitted as surplus because section 41901 of the revised title specifies how the rates of compensation are determined.</p>
