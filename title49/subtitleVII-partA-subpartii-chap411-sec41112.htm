<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Liability Insurance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation may issue a certificate to a citizen of the United States to provide air transportation as an air carrier under section 41102 of this title only if the citizen complies with regulations and orders of the Secretary governing the filing of an insurance policy or self-insurance plan approved by the Secretary. The policy or plan must be sufficient to pay, not more than the amount of the insurance, for bodily injury to, or death of, an individual or for loss of, or damage to, property of others, resulting from the operation or maintenance of the aircraft under the certificate. A certificate does not remain in effect unless the carrier complies with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Financial Responsibility</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To protect passengers and shippers using an aircraft operated by an air carrier issued a certificate under section 41102 of this title, the Secretary may require the carrier to file a performance bond or equivalent security in the amount and on terms the Secretary prescribes. The bond or security must be sufficient to ensure the carrier adequately will pay the passengers and shippers when the transportation the carrier agrees to provide is not provided. The Secretary shall prescribe the amounts to be paid under this subsection.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;citizen of the United States&rdquo; and &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;applicant for such certificate or the air carrier&rdquo; for clarity and consistency because only a citizen of the United States may be an &ldquo;air carrier&rdquo; as defined in section 40102(a) of the revised title and receive a certificate. The words &ldquo;as the case may be&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The words &ldquo;to provide air transportation as an air carrier under section 41102 of this title&rdquo; are added for clarity. The words &ldquo;approved by the Secretary&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;governing the filing and approval .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the amount prescribed by the Board&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;The policy or plan must be sufficient to pay&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;which are conditioned to pay .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. amounts&rdquo; for clarity. The words &ldquo;for which such applicant or such air carrier may become liable for&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the word &ldquo;passengers&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;travelers&rdquo; for consistency in this chapter. The words &ldquo;issued .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. under section 41102 of this title&rdquo; are added for clarity. The word &ldquo;arrangement&rdquo; is omitted as surplus. The word &ldquo;provide&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;perform&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title.</p>
