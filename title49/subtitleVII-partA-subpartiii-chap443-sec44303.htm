<p class="note-body">In this section, before clause (1), the words &ldquo;persons, property, or interest&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary. In clause (2), the word &ldquo;property&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;Cargoes&rdquo; and &ldquo;air cargoes&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title. In clause (2)(B) and (C), the words &ldquo;its territories, or possessions&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because of the definition of &ldquo;United States&rdquo; in section 40102(a) of the revised title. In clause (2)(C)(ii), the word &ldquo;contract&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;contracts of sale or purchase&rdquo;, and the words &ldquo;putting .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;is assumed by or falls upon&rdquo;, to eliminate unnecessary words. In clause (2)(D), the word &ldquo;place&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;point&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title. In subclause (i), the words &ldquo;a State or the District of Columbia&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the United States&rdquo; for clarity and consistency because the definition of &ldquo;United States&rdquo; in section 40102(a) of the revised title is too broad for the context of the clause. The definition in section 40102(a) includes territories and possession and would therefore overlap with subclauses (ii) and (iii). In subclause (iii), the words &ldquo;2 places in the same territory or possession of the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;any point in any such territory or possession and any other point in the same territory or possession&rdquo; for clarity. In clauses (3) and (4), the word &ldquo;individuals&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;persons&rdquo; as being more appropriate. The words &ldquo;captains&rdquo; and &ldquo;pilots&rdquo; are omitted as being included in &ldquo;officers and members of the crew&rdquo;.</p>
