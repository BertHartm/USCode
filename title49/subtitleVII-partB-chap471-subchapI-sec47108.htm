At the request of the sponsor, an offer of a grant for a project that will not be completed in one fiscal year shall provide for the obligation of amounts apportioned or to be apportioned to a sponsor under section 47114(c) of this title for the fiscal years necessary to pay the Government's share of the cost of the project.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An increase under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph may be paid only from amounts the Government recovers from other grants made under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For a project receiving assistance under a grant approved under the Act, this subchapter, or chapter 475 of this title after September 30, 1987, the amount may be increased&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for a grant after September 30, 1992, to acquire an interest in land for an airport (except a primary airport), by not more than the greater of the following, based on current creditable appraisals or a court award in a condemnation proceeding:</p>
