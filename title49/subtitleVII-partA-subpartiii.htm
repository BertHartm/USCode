<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, &ldquo;controlled substance&rdquo; has the same meaning given that term in section 102 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 802).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Revocations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall issue an order revoking the certificate of registration for an aircraft issued to an owner under section 44103 of this title and any other certificate of registration that the owner of the aircraft holds under section 44103, if the Administrator finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the aircraft was used to carry out, or facilitate, an activity that is punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year under a law of the United States or a State related to a controlled substance (except a law related to simple possession of a controlled substance); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the owner of the aircraft permitted the use of the aircraft knowing that the aircraft was to be used for the activity described in clause (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An aircraft owner that is not an individual is deemed to have permitted the use of the aircraft knowing that the aircraft was to be used for the activity described in paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection only if a majority of the individuals who control the owner of the aircraft or who are involved in forming the major policy of the owner permitted the use of the aircraft knowing that the aircraft was to be used for the activity described in paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Advice to Holders and Opportunity To Answer</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before the Administrator revokes a certificate under subsection (b) of this section, the Administrator shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) advise the holder of the certificate of the charges or reasons on which the Administrator bases the proposed action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide the holder of the certificate an opportunity to answer the charges and state why the certificate should not be revoked.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Appeals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person whose certificate is revoked by the Administrator under subsection (b) of this section may appeal the revocation order to the National Transportation Safety Board. The Board shall affirm or reverse the order after providing notice and a hearing on the record. In conducting the hearing, the Board <!-- PDFPage:575 -->is not bound by the findings of fact of the Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When a person files an appeal with the Board under this subsection, the order of the Administrator revoking the certificate is stayed. However, if the Administrator advises the Board that safety in air transportation or air commerce requires the immediate effectiveness of the order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the order remains effective; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Board shall dispose of the appeal not later than 60 days after notification by the Administrator under this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A person substantially affected by an order of the Board under this subsection may seek judicial review of the order under section 46110 of this title. The Administrator shall be made a party to that judicial proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Acquittal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator may not revoke, and the Board may not affirm a revocation of, a certificate of registration under this section on the basis of an activity described in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section if the holder of the certificate is acquitted of all charges related to a controlled substance in an indictment or information arising from the activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Administrator has revoked a certificate of registration of a person under this section because of an activity described in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section, the Administrator shall reissue a certificate to the person if the person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) subsequently is acquitted of all charges related to a controlled substance in an indictment or information arising from the activity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) otherwise meets the requirements of section 44102 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Disputed Losses</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A person may bring a civil action in a district court of the United States against the United States Government when a loss insured under this chapter is in dispute. A civil action involving the same matter (except the action authorized by this subsection) may not be brought against an agent, officer, or employee of the Government carrying out this chapter. To the extent applicable, the procedure in an action brought under section 1346(a)(2) of title 28 applies to an action under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Venue and Joinder</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A civil action under subsection (a) of this section may be brought in the judicial district for the District of Columbia or in the judicial district in which the plaintiff or the agent of the plaintiff resides if the plaintiff resides in the United States. If the plaintiff does not reside in the United States, the action may be brought in the judicial district for the District of Columbia or in the judicial district in which the Attorney General agrees to accept service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An interested person may be joined as a party to a civil action brought under subsection (a) of this section initially or on motion of either party to the action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Time Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When an insurance claim is made under this chapter, the period during which, under section 2401 of title 28, a civil action must be brought under subsection (a) of this section is suspended until 60 days after the Secretary of Transportation denies the claim. The claim is deemed to be administratively denied if the Secretary does not act on the claim not later than 6 months after filing, unless the Secretary makes a different agreement with the claimant when there is good cause for an agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Interpleader</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Secretary admits the Government owes money under an insurance claim under this chapter and there is a dispute about the person that is entitled to payment, the Government may bring a civil action of interpleader in a district court of the United States against the persons that may be entitled to payment. The action may be brought in the judicial district for the District of Columbia or in the judicial district in which any party resides.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The district court may order a party not residing or found in the judicial district in which the action is brought to appear in a civil action under this subsection. The order shall be served in a reasonable manner decided by the district court. If the court decides an unknown person might assert a claim under the insurance that is the subject of the action, the court may order service on that person by publication in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall issue an airman certificate to an individual when the Administrator finds, after investigation, that the individual is qualified for, and physically able to perform the duties related to, the position to be authorized by the certificate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Contents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An airman certificate shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be numbered and recorded by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) contain the name, address, and description of the individual to whom the certificate is issued;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) contain terms the Administrator decides are necessary to ensure safety in air commerce, including terms on the duration of the certificate, periodic or special examinations, and tests of physical fitness;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) specify the capacity in which the holder of the certificate may serve as an airman with respect to an aircraft; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) designate the class the certificate covers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A certificate issued to a pilot serving in scheduled air transportation shall have the designation &ldquo;airline transport pilot&rdquo; of the appropriate class.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Appeals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An individual whose application for the issuance or renewal of an airman certificate has been denied may appeal the denial to the National Transportation Safety Board, except if the individual holds a certificate that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is suspended at the time of denial; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) was revoked within one year from the date of the denial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Board shall conduct a hearing on the appeal at a place convenient to the place of residence or employment of the applicant. The Board is not bound by findings of fact of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration but is bound by all validly adopted interpretations of laws and regulations the Administrator carries out unless the Board finds an interpretation is arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not according to law. At the end of the hearing, the Board shall decide whether the individual meets the applicable regulations and standards. The Administrator is bound by that decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Restrictions and Prohibitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) restrict or prohibit issuing an airman certificate to an alien; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as provided in section 44710(e)(2) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Modifications in System</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall make modifications in the system for issuing airman certificates necessary to make the system more effective in serving the needs of pilots and officials responsible for enforcing laws related to the regulation of controlled substances (as defined in section 102 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 802)). The modifications shall ensure positive and verifiable identification of each individual applying for or holding a certificate and shall address at least each of the following deficiencies in, and abuses of, the existing system:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the use of fictitious names and addresses by applicants for those certificates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the use of stolen or fraudulent identification in applying for those certificates.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the use of counterfeit and stolen airman certificates by pilots.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the absence of information about physical characteristics of holders of those certificates.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall prescribe regulations to carry out paragraph (1) of this subsection and provide a written explanation of how the regulations address each of the deficiencies and abuses described in paragraph (1).

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;44710. Revocations of airman certificates for controlled substance violations</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, &ldquo;controlled substance&rdquo; has the same meaning given that term in section 102 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 802).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Revocation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall issue an order revoking an airman certificate issued an individual under section 44703 of this title after the individual is convicted, under a law of the United States or a State related to a controlled substance (except a law related to simple possession of a controlled substance), of an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year if the Administrator finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an aircraft was used to commit, or facilitate the commission of, the offense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the individual served as an airman, or was on the aircraft, in connection with committing, or facilitating the commission of, the offense.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator shall issue an order revoking an airman certificate issued an individual under section 44703 of this title if the Administrator finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the individual knowingly carried out an activity punishable, under a law of the United States or a State related to a controlled substance (except a law related to simple possession of a controlled substance), by death or imprisonment for more than one year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an aircraft was used to carry out or facilitate the activity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the individual served as an airman, or was on the aircraft, in connection with carrying out, or facilitating the carrying out of, the activity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator has no authority under paragraph (1) of this subsection to review whether an airman violated a law of the United States or a State related to a controlled substance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Advice to Holders and Opportunity To Answer</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before the Administrator revokes a certificate under subsection (b) of this section, the Administrator must&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) advise the holder of the certificate of the charges or reasons on which the Administrator relies for the proposed revocation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide the holder of the certificate an opportunity to answer the charges and be heard why the certificate should not be revoked.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:604 --><p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Appeals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) An individual whose certificate is revoked by the Administrator under subsection (b) of this section may appeal the revocation order to the National Transportation Safety Board. The Board shall affirm or reverse the order after providing notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the record. When conducting the hearing, the Board is not bound by findings of fact of the Administrator but shall be bound by all validly adopted interpretations of laws and regulations the Administrator carries out and of written agency policy guidance available to the public related to sanctions to be imposed under this section unless the Board finds an interpretation is arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not according to law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When an individual files an appeal with the Board under this subsection, the order of the Administrator revoking the certificate is stayed. However, if the Administrator advises the Board that safety in air transportation or air commerce requires the immediate effectiveness of the order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the order remains effective; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Board shall make a final disposition of the appeal not later than 60 days after the Administrator so advises the Board.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An individual substantially affected by an order of the Board under this subsection, or the Administrator when the Administrator decides that an order of the Board will have a significant adverse effect on carrying out this part, may obtain judicial review of the order under section 46110 of this title. The Administrator shall be made a party to the judicial review proceedings. Findings of fact of the Board are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Acquittal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator may not revoke, and the Board may not affirm a revocation of, an airman certificate under subsection (b)(2) of this section on the basis of an activity described in subsection (b)(2)(A) if the holder of the certificate is acquitted of all charges related to a controlled substance in an indictment or information arising from the activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Administrator has revoked an airman certificate under this section because of an activity described in subsection (b)(2)(A) of this section, the Administrator shall reissue a certificate to the individual if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the individual otherwise satisfies the requirements for a certificate under section 44703 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) the individual subsequently is acquitted of all charges related to a controlled substance in an indictment or information arising from the activity; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the conviction on which a revocation under subsection (b)(1) of this section is based is reversed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Waivers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may waive the requirement of subsection (b) of this section that an airman certificate of an individual be revoked if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a law enforcement official of the United States Government or of a State requests a waiver; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Administrator decides that the waiver will facilitate law enforcement efforts.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) authorized to carry and use firearms;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) vested with the degree of the police power of arrest the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration considers necessary to carry out this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) identifiable by appropriate indicia of authority.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Protection Against Violence and Piracy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall prescribe regulations to protect passengers and property on an aircraft operating in air transportation or intrastate air transportation against an act of criminal violence or aircraft piracy. When prescribing a regulation under this subsection, the Administrator shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consult with the Secretary of Transportation, the Attorney General, the heads of other departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States Government, and State and local authorities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consider whether a proposed regulation is consistent with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) protecting passengers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the public interest in promoting air transportation and intrastate air transportation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) consider the extent to which a proposed regulation will carry out this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Security Programs</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Administrator shall prescribe regulations under subsection (b) of this section that require each operator of an airport regularly serving an air carrier holding a certificate issued by the Secretary of Transportation to establish an air transportation security program that provides a law enforcement presence and capability at each of those airports that is adequate to ensure the safety of passengers. The regulations shall authorize the operator to use the services of qualified State, local, and private law enforcement personnel. When the Administrator decides, after being notified by an operator in the form the Administrator prescribes, that not enough qualified State, local, and private law enforcement personnel are available to carry out subsection (b), the Administrator may authorize the operator to use, on a reimbursable basis, personnel employed by the Administrator, or by another department, agency, or instrumentality of the Government with the consent of the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality, to supplement State, local, and private law enforcement personnel. When deciding whether additional personnel are needed, the Administrator shall consider the number of passengers boarded at the airport, the extent of anticipated risk of criminal violence or aircraft piracy at the airport or to the air carrier aircraft operations at the airport, and the availability of qualified State or local law enforcement personnel at the airport.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Administrator may approve a security program of an airport operator, or an amendment in an existing program, that incorporates a security program of an airport tenant (except an air carrier separately complying with part 108 or 129 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations) having access to a secured area of the airport, if the program or amendment incorporates&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the measures the tenant will use, within the tenant's leased areas or areas designated for the tenant's exclusive use under an agreement with the airport operator, to carry out the security requirements imposed by the Administrator on the airport operator under the access control system requirements of section 107.14 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, or under other requirements of part 107 of title 14; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the methods the airport operator will use to monitor and audit the tenant's compliance <!-- PDFPage:616 -->with the security requirements and provides that the tenant will be required to pay monetary penalties to the airport operator if the tenant fails to carry out a security requirement under a contractual provision or requirement imposed by the airport operator.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Administrator approves a program or amendment described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the airport operator may not be found to be in violation of a requirement of this subsection or subsection (b) of this section when the airport operator demonstrates that the tenant or an employee, permittee, or invitee of the tenant is responsible for the violation and that the airport operator has complied with all measures in its security program for securing compliance with its security program by the tenant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Authorizing Individuals To Carry Firearms and Make Arrests</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;With the approval of the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Transportation may authorize an individual who carries out air transportation security duties&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to carry firearms; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to make arrests without warrant for an offense against the United States committed in the presence of the individual or for a felony under the laws of the United States, if the individual reasonably believes the individual to be arrested has committed or is committing a felony.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Exclusive Responsibility Over Passenger Safety</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator has the exclusive responsibility to direct law enforcement activity related to the safety of passengers on an aircraft involved in an offense under section 46502 of this title from the moment all external doors of the aircraft are closed following boarding until those doors are opened to allow passengers to leave the aircraft. When requested by the Administrator, other departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Government shall provide assistance necessary to carry out this subsection.</p>

The Administrator shall base the certification on the results of tests conducted under protocols developed in consultation with expert scientists outside of the Administration. Those tests shall be completed not later than April 16, 1992.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before completion of the tests described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, but not later than April 16, 1992, the Administrator may require deployment of explosive detection equipment described in paragraph (1) if the Administrator decides that deployment will enhance aviation security significantly. In making that decision, the Administrator shall consider factors such as the ability of the equipment alone, or as part of an integrated system, to detect under realistic air carrier operating conditions the amounts, configurations, and types of explosive material that would likely be used to cause catastrophic damage to commercial aircraft. The Administrator shall notify the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives of a deployment decision made under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection does not prohibit the Administrator from purchasing or deploying explosive detection equipment described in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
